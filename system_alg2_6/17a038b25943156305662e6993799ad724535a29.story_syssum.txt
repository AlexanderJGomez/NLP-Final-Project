London, England (CNN) -- Pop singer George Michael was jailed Tuesday to serve an eight-week sentence after pleading guilty to a charge that he drove while under the influence of drugs.
He said he had taken a sleeping pill that had been prescribed eight days earlier and admitted smoking cannabis earlier in the night, Efemini said.
Michael was found guilty in 2007 of unfit driving through tiredness and prescription medication and received a two-year driving ban.
Michael has used prescribed medicine for many years, Chawla said, and earlier this year decided to stop taking them completely.
"His creativity, so long hidden by the [drugs], is reemerging," Chawla said.
