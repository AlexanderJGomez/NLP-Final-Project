Washington (CNN) -- The House Energy and Commerce Committee requested documents and information Monday from Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms of Iowa related to the recent salmonella outbreak and egg recalls, according to a news release from the office of the committee's chairman, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California.
In a statement issued Monday morning, Wright County Egg said it was working with the Food and Drug Administration on the current recalls and defended its record.
"Wright County Egg strives to operate our farms in the most responsible manner, and our management team has worked closely with FDA through their review of our farms.
In the letter, DeLauro asked the United States Department of Agriculture and the FDA, which share jurisdiction in this area, about the investigation into the DeCoster farm's safety record and the oversight of its operations.
