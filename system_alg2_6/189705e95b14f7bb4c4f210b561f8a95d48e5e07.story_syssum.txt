At issue is whether someone previously barred from a military base may be convicted under federal law for "peacefully protesting" on a public road easement along the enclosed high-security facility.
"You've got a public school and a public highway" on the base, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said.
The federal government owns and operates the base, but the state and county have held a "use easement" for more than a half-century, and they maintain the roads.
A federal appeals court eventually ruled in his favor, saying the special protest zone was not an area under the military's "exclusive right of possession."
"When an easement goes towards a public road, that easement includes the right to use the public road for speech activities," he said.
It's their base.

What's wrong with that?"
The case is U.S. v. Apel (12-1038).
