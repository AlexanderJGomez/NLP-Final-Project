Come the second half of 2014, however, an all-new system of mass transportation is set to reduce the burden on these chaotic roadways.
The La Paz urban gondola will consist of three separate service lines stretching across a combined 10.7 kilometer (6.1 mile) area of the city.
Cost benefits like these have been key in convincing South American cities like La Paz that urban gondolas are a viable and economical transport solution.
"Being able to connect people from an island, which is what these barrios often are, to the wider city where they can access economic, social and cultural opportunities, that's the real value," Dale said.
Many skeptics point to the "cable car" system built in East London to connect the O2 Arena and the ExCel Exhibition Centre across the River Thames during the 2012 Olympic Games as an example of an urban gondola project gone wrong.
Although critical of the London project, Biggs believes the gondola concept itself can still offer a valuable urban transit option if constructed in locations where there is demand and the economic case can be justified.
