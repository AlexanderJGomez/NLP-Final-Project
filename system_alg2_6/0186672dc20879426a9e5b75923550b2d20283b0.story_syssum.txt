New York (CNN) -- Like so many other people of my generation, John Lennon and the Beatles made an indelible stamp on my life.
At the time, I was a music journalist for City TV in Toronto, Canada, hosting "The New Music" program.
Are the reports mistaken?
We gathered that night in our offices to sift through the material that we had: old Beatles footage, a Lennon documentary that my producer shot years earlier, and the famous D.A.
He will stay there for at least another two years as he was just denied parole for the sixth time.
Lennon's profound influence on music and musicians continues to this day.
Like Roberge, I've often wondered what would have happened had Lennon not been murdered.
Would the world have been a better place?
