(CNN) -- The family of the man authorities say was dismembered by a Canadian porn actor called for the suspect's quick extradition Tuesday and expressed hope that their "devastating situation" could become something positive.
"We are calling for the extradition of the murder suspect back to Canada as soon as possible in order to bring justice and peace to our family, the Chinese community and the whole society," they said.
Police say they believe Magnotta killed and dismembered Lin and posted a 10-minute video of the slaying online.
German authorities nabbed him June 4 in Berlin, where they said he had been spotted browsing online articles about himself at an Internet cafe.
