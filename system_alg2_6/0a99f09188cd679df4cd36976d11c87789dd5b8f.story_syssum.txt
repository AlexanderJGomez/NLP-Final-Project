Russell is familiar with how women are portrayed in the media.
Cameron Russell: I had been thinking about an online participatory magazine for a while.
Critical voices from women and people of color are missing from many important conversations.
But it's not just girls.
These girls liked their bodies because they functioned well!
The lesson here is that when we value a narrow range of experiences and perspectives, we don't just have a media that lack diversity, we actually underestimate our audiences.
Russell: Actually, I think working on the offline Genius Lab.
Check them out on our Tumblr feed.
We've found artists like Ernest English, who made a piece that is drawing the most attention in the Genius Lab.
Russell: Every time someone who isn't a "media maker" creates something that goes viral, every time someone whose perspective is left out of mainstream media proves to make an impact, every time a contributor collaborates with someone new to make better work, we improve the media landscape a little bit.
Russell: I'm inspired by the people I work with.
And then there's the graffiti artist and muralist known as miss163.
