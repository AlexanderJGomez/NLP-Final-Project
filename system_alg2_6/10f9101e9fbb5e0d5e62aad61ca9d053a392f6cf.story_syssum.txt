(Wired) -- It's almost impossible for a photographer to find fresh visual perspectives these days.
So it's kind of this hidden airspace to the human eye, and it just immediately struck me as a really powerful visual."
Seckler was soon introduced to a pilot, who took him on his first ultra-light flight over the salt flats.
Seckler took thousands of photographs of the landscape itself, but found that even with strong compositions, the pure landscapes could become harder to make sense of.
"For me it was capturing a really unique vision of our world, a beautiful landscape from a unique perspective, and framing moments that create interesting contrast between living things, whether they be animals or flora, and the earth itself."
Seckler says he's been flattered by the response to the series, and credits its positive reception in part to a dearth of public exposure to aerial photography as art.
