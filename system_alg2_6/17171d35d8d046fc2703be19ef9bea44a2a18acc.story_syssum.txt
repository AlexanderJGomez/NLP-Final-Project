In the vast majority of cases, these weather systems weaken hurricanes while at the same time pushing them quickly out to sea.
Rather than racing out to sea like most coastal storms, Sandy has already turned hard to the left and it will make landfall at nearly a right angle to the U.S. coastline.
Thus, Sandy has each of the worst features of both kinds of storm: a small core of hurricane-force winds around its center, and a broad expanse of gale-force winds extending hundreds of miles outward that will batter the shorelines for several days.
Sandy will take its place in history, but we will not know what that place is until many days have passed.
