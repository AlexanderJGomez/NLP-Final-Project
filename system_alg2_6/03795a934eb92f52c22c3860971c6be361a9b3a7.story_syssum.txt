Alonso, 29, admitted he made a bad start in the year's third grand prix but maintained race strategy was not the reason behind Ferrari's low-scoring performance.
We know we have to improve to get to the front.
I expect our engineers to act with determination and know-how, unleashing the maximum of their capacity to improve the performance of the car in a short time.
Ferrari's decision making hit the headlines at the end of the 2010 season when an error in race strategy cost Alonso a third world title at the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
