DC Comics pulled the cover for the upcoming "Batgirl" #41, which portrays the Joker threatening a frightened Batgirl with a gun, with "Joker makeup" on her mouth.
DC Comics (owned by Time Warner, which also owns CNN) said in a statement late Monday that artist Rafael Albuquerque's cover was going to be pulled.
For that reason, I have recommended to DC that the variant cover be pulled.
There's no 'censorship' here."
1 variant cover caused an uproar for being "over-sexualized."
