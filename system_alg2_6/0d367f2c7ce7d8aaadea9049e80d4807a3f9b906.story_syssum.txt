It's not?
This year for old times' sake we revived our game, only doing the best actor category because it's been an impossibly full year of great male lead performances that have stumped the prognosticators.
David, a great strategist, and Miles the Scorsese devotee, both recognized Leo DiCaprio's high standing with the Academy, even if Miles won't be seeing that film anytime soon, I pray.
Of course, Oscar mania is not just about the horse race.
My favorite year was 1978, the night Jane Fonda and Jon Voight took the best leads categories for "Coming Home."
If you are not in our little club, I get where you're coming from.
Plus, there's red carpet fatigue, as the Oscars limp on high heels to the finish line of a bloated awards season as overextended as Christmas and the NFL.
Will I sound like I'm on the Academy's payroll if I argue that the Oscars really are a great national tradition?
Trying to catch a loser register a little disappointment.
The knowing that it's all too much, but the kind of too much that some of us just can't get enough of.
