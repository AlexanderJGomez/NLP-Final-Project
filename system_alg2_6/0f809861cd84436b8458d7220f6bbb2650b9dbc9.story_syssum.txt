The officers found something startling: an online search for information about how long it takes animals to die in hot cars, the source said.
Police in Cobb County, just outside Atlanta, have been tight-lipped and haven't said whether what they found on the computer is one of the reasons they arrested Harris.
The funding of the funeral from the Home Depot charity, the Homer Fund, is a "standard approach," she said.
On the day Cooper died, Harris stopped for breakfast at a fast-food restaurant and afterward strapped his son into a rear-facing child restraint seat on his SUV's back seat, police said.
But that day, police said, Harris left him in the car seat.
The organization says its tally is likely incomplete and much lower than the real toll.
Another, set up at YouCaring.com, has raised more than $22,000 for the Harris family.
The Cobb County medical examiner's office found the child's cause of death "consistent with hyperthermia and the investigative information suggests the manner of death is homicide," according to a Cobb County Department of Public Safety statement issued Wednesday.
