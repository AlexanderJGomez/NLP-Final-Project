(CNN) -- Milton might be dead on "The Walking Dead," but actor Dallas Roberts (who portrayed the Governor's one-time lackey) is very glad to be alive -- and finally able to talk about the show's season three finale.
"From the beginning, they were like, 'No sexy dirt on him.
He's always clean.
Milton didn't imagine that he would be "used as a tool to take Andrea out" as well, and if he had, "he would have behaved differently," Roberts said.
"Before the door opened and he throws me to my knees, he and I were crying, laughing, at the jokes we were making," Roberts said.
Roberts laughed.
"I wasn't going to take the clothes, for sure," he said.
