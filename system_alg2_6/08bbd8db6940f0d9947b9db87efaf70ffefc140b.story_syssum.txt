Turkey has turned against its former ally, asking fellow NATO members last week for the missiles to bolster its air defenses because of several Turkish deaths blamed on Syrian forces.
In October, the Turkish government won authorization in parliament for possible cross-border military incursions into Syria after Syrian mortar fire killed five civilians in the Turkish border town of Akcakale.
Back on the ground in Syria, "fierce aerial shelling" bombarded areas in the northwestern part of the country Tuesday, dissidents said.
More than 70 countries have signed a treaty banning the use of cluster bombs, but Syria is not among them.
In October, the Syrian government said it had not used cluster bombs during the current conflict.
