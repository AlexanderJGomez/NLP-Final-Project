Berlin (CNN) -- The outbreak of E. coli in Germany has killed several more people and sickened hundreds, authorities said Tuesday.
His hospital has 600 to 700 infected patients, Debatin said.
Sweden's health ministry said there have been 39 confirmed cases of people sickened by E. coli in Sweden, 16 of which are being investigated for complications caused by HUS.
The questions surrounding produce from Spain have "paralyzed" vegetable exports, a spokeswoman for Fepex, the Spanish export producers group for vegetables and fruits, said Tuesday.
The Fepex officials argue that German authorities have accused the Spanish cucumber of being the source of the outbreak, without proof.
A Spanish health ministry spokesman told CNN that Spanish authorities are investigating the outbreak.
The Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition said two Spanish companies producing cucumbers may be involved in the outbreak.
