After inpatient rehab, Felicia Anderson sought help from Mothers Making a Change to help beat her addiction.
Anderson was both.
"I can say with everything in me, with every bit of my breath, that program helped me turn my life around," said Anderson, who now runs a program to help the developmentally disabled in DeKalb County, Georgia.
Anderson began drinking and smoking marijuana in high school.

Anderson said she even smoked crack as she went into labor with her second child.

Anderson now has everything she had lost for a big part of her adult life: a stable home life, a job.
