Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Fertility issues were at the center of former TV chef Juan-Carlos Cruz's motivation in the alleged murder-for-hire plot to kill his wife, according to sources close to the couple.
The source would not comment on whether she was aware of the alleged planning before his arrest.
The criminal complaint filed Monday accused Cruz of trying to hire David Carrington and David Walters -- homeless men who go by the street names Little Dave and Big Dave -- to murder Campbell.
Santa Monica police began their undercover investigation of Cruz on May 7, Trisler said.
Santa Monica police put them in a hotel room to keep them out of sight, Big Dave said.
He wrote "The Juan-Carlos Cruz Calorie Countdown Cookbook: A 5-Week Eating Strategy for Sustainable Weight Loss," published in 2007.
