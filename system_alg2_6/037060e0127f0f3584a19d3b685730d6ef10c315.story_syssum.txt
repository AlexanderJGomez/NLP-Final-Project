Marc Marquez held off Valentino Rossi to claim the opening MotoGP race of the season in Qatar on Sunday, picking up where he left off last year.
"I enjoyed a lot that race, especially after the injury," Marquez told BT Sport.
Do I attack?'"
The two-time MotoGP world champion -- and last year's winner in Qatar -- crashed in the first lap after a blistering start that saw him move to the front.
The second race of the season takes place April 13 in Austin.
