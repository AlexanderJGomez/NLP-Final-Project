(CNN) -- Ukraine's imprisoned opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko accuses the country's president of running a "mafia" government in a video smuggled out of her prison by her lawyer, the lawyer told CNN Sunday.
"It is the first video made of her this year.
The last video of the opposition leader showed her bed-ridden in Kharkiv prison during a hunger strike in December 2011.
After the video surfaced on Friday, the Ukrainian Prison Service quickly posted their own video of the country's former leader.
