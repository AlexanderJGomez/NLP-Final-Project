It has provided an ideal case study for disaster relief, and an Oxfam report, published today, examines the lessons that have been learned, as well as areas that the humanitarian relief sector still needs to improve upon.
Oxfam says the response to the humanitarian catastrophe was the "largest-ever privately funded response," with private donations making up 40% of all money raised -- an impressive $5.4 billion, which came close to matching government donations of $6.4 billion.
The charity says that one of the key lessons learned from the tsunami and its aftermath is that humanitarian funding needs to become more equitable.
Pooled funds, Cocking says, allow agencies like Oxfam to use donations for humanitarian crises which are equally important, but perhaps not as high impact.
In the 1990s [humanitarian crisis survivors] depended on organizations like Oxfam to get the word out, but not so much any more.
Having experienced the full brunt of a disaster of this magnitude, the affected countries have been urged to "build back better," enhancing their own preparedness to lessen the impact of future events.
