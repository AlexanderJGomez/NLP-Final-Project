It was not until the Iowa caucus win by Obama that many black Americans started to believe it was possible for a black man to become president.
She further indicated that the black caucus wanted to put pressure on Obama, but could not, due to the fact that black people "love the president."
Finally, the White House started a blitz of interviews on black media.
We are going to press on.
Their take is that they are standing up for those who cannot stand up for themselves and that they are pushing a black agenda as others have pushed their own agendas.
But those of us who are journalists would be wrong not to question why black America is so willing to tolerate such openly unbalanced treatment when other groups would never accept it.
Obama seemed to be asking black America once again to keep the faith -- to "press on" and to "shake it off."
The cold hard fact is that no group is being as negatively impacted by this recession as blacks, so it is proper and necessary for the CBC and others to continue to press this president to do more.
