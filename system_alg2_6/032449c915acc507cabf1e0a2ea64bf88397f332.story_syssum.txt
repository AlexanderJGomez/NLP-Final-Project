Los Angeles (CNN) -- The remaining plaintiff in the sexual battery lawsuit against John Travolta fired his lawyer, but the case could continue with another lawyer and another court, two lawyers told CNN on Thursday.
Allred said Tuesday that she and John Doe #1 would discuss if a new lawsuit would be filed against Travolta.
Okorocha told CNN the date should have been January 15, but the mistake would have hampered the chances of John Doe #2 in court.
"Clients come to me," Allred said.
Okorocha, reached by Wednesday afternoon, said he had a text message exchange on Tuesday with his client saying he was called by Allred.
