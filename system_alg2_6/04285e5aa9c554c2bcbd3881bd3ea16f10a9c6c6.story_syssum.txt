Wayne Nelson Corliss was arrested at his New Jersey apartment.
It was among items found in his apartment, along with five hard drives containing more than 1,000 images of child pornography, according to prosecutors.
Corliss is charged with producing child pornography, according to prosecutors.
The complaint alleges that the suspect's face is clearly shown and the background suggests the images were taken in Thailand.
A search of U.S. passport information found an image of Corliss that police compared to the photographs, the complaint said.
