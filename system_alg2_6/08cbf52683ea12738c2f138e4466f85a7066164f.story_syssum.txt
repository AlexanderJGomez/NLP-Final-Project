"The film is a wonderful ambassador, in a way, of South Africa and I think as it travels the world it's going to spread the word about an industry that is young and vibrant and extremely talented," says "Zambezia" director and co-writer Wayne Thornley.
Thornley says the movie was guided by the traditional African principle of ubuntu, which he describes roughly as "a person is a person only because of other people" -- he says that the movie's heartwarming theme will resonate with both African and international audiences.
The third computer generated 3D film to be made in South Africa, "Zambezia" is  "probably the biggest budget animated film ever to come out of anywhere in Africa," says Thornley  -- Triggerfish was unable to disclose how much the film cost, but said its budget was under $20 million.
Working with top Hollywood stars such as Jackson and Goldblum was "an honor" and "really fun", says Thornley.
"I want people to sit back and have a fantastic time with the characters and have a fantastic insight into some of the amazing African landscapes that we've put into this film," says Thornley.
