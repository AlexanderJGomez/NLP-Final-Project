One proposed solution that didn't go anywhere was the DREAM Act, a bill that politicians passed around like a hot potato for more than a decade.
The Cuban-American GOP rock star and potential GOP vice presidential nominee is floating the idea of a modified DREAM Act that would keep undocumented immigrant students from being deported by giving them legal status in the form of a student visa followed by a work visa.
The idea was originally shared with me about five months ago by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who, along with her colleague, Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, was eager to find a way to break the stalemate over the DREAM Act and help get these young people out of legal limbo and on with their lives.
You know who does want to give these students automatic citizenship?
So what?
There are no good guys and bad guys, just both parties pushing their own interests without caring about what happens to a bunch of undocumented students.
It matters to the deliberations that these lawmakers are all Latino.
A Republican like Rubio has a cultural connection to Democrats like Gutierrez, Menendez and Gonzales.
