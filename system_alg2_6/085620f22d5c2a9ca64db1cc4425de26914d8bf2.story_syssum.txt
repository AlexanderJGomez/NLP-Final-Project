When long-serving President Hosni Mubarak was toppled from power two and a half years ago, it was the beginning, not the end, of a revolution that has yet to run its course.
Many voted for Morsy simply because they saw him as the lesser of two evils, running against former Mubarak stalwart Ahmed Shafiq.
"One, Ahmed Shafiq kills you, and the other, Morsy, gives you a bad stomach ache.
"It's over.
Many Egyptians were deeply offended that Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood put their identity as Muslims before their identity as Egyptians.
One guest, clearly repulsed, told Al-Gohary, "You don't know the history of your country well.
But in the brave, new Egypt, no one gives up without a fight.
He is our legitimate president.
Morsy, their servant, did a bad job so they fired him.
The real revolution in Egypt is not in the streets.
