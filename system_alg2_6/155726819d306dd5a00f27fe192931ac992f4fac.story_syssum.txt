Why?
So -- in essence -- everyone can get free health care if they need it.
But there's no guarantee of prenatal care in the emergency department.
You can't get preventive care in the emergency department.
And even if you could, it wouldn't be free.
A recent article in the New York Times detailed how Accretive Health, a medical debt collector, is using aggressive tactics such as confronting patients in their hospital beds to collect the money owed for even emergent care.
It might even be worse in North Carolina, where a group of nonprofit hospitals sued 40,000 patients from 2005 to 2010.
But let's acknowledge that patients will be held accountable for the costs of their care, even in the emergency room.
So it's true that an emergency room won't let you die if you show up at the door, but short of that, you can't get care for a host of medical issues.
