"I believe the Lord chose me to lead that group," said Terry, who lives in Hurst, Texas.
But the circumstances of Terry's experience are unique, because there was a defibrillator nearby, and somebody knew how to use it.
Next, begin doing CPR, employ the use of a defibrillator and get the victim into the hands of capable medical professionals like the paramedics.
And statistics also show that if the chain of survival is initiated within 4 minutes, the chances of survival can be as high as 60 percent.
And Terry says he won't stop until the defibrillator is as ubiquitous in public places as a sprinkler system.
