"We were having fun and laughing and then, all of a sudden, we heard a really loud bang," the 15-year-old told CNN.

Initially, the teacher opened the door, he said.
Myers, the sophomore, and his fellow classmates were sitting in the dark when he started to think about his twin brother, Austin.
He knew his brother should be in class.
Then he sent a text message to a friend, who he knew had a class with his brother.
Panicked and in tears, Myers reached out to his father by text message: Dad, Austin is missing.
