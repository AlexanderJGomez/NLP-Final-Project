We spent some time testing and touching the new iPad Mini and iPad Air after Tuesday's press conference.
Physically, the iPad Air is indeed lighter and thinner than its predecessor.
Unfortunately, I didn't have an older iPad on hand to do a weight comparison, and I'd picked up an iPad Mini first.
The iPad Mini got its first upgrade since it was first launched one year ago.
Like the iPad Air, the iPad Mini with Retina has the A7 chip inside.
Though other products can usually be had for much less, any hands-on time with Apple products remind you that one of their greatest selling points is solid, high-quality construction.
Faster processors gobble up more battery power, so maintaining 10 hours of battery life from an old tablet to a new tablet probably requires battery improvements.
The competition will stay close until the first company breaks out of the usual faster, thinner, faster upgrade cycle and solves the battery problem.
