Gilberto Valle, who has already served 21 months in jail and faced life in prison on the kidnap conspiracy conviction, did not say a word when he appeared in a federal courtroom Tuesday.
U.S. District Court Judge Paul Gardephe also ordered GPS home monitoring for the defendant.
The database, which Valle was trained to use and had access to as a police officer, helped him research potential victims, prosecutors said.
According to trial evidence, he communicated online with three co-conspirators on the Dark Fetish Network, prosecutors said.
