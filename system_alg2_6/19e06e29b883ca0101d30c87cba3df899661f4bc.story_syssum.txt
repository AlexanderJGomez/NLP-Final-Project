Wenjian Liu was remembered Saturday at Aievoli Funeral Home in Brooklyn, where Mayor Bill de Blasio, Police Commissioner William Bratton, local officials and throngs of uniformed police officers and firefighters gathered at his wake in a sign of the diversity and unity of the nation's largest city.
On Saturday, several officers saluted de Blasio when he arrived at the funeral home.
He has called for searing protest by police officers, and some have heeded that call.
But for Sunday's funeral, Bratton is putting his foot down at a potential repeat by some officers.
Ramos and Liu were sitting in their squad car in Brooklyn when Ismaaiyl Brinsley ambushed them with a gun December 20.
Liu's family came to the United States from Canton, China, in search of a better life.
His family was waiting for family to come from China.
Andrew Cuomo, de Blasio and Bratton delivered eulogies at his funeral.
