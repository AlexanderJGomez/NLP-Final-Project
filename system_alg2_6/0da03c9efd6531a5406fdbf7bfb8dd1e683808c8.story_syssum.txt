GAZA CITY, Gaza (CNN) -- Israeli forces fired on a U.N. aid convoy Thursday in Gaza, killing at least one contract worker and prompting the U.N. to halt some of its operations in Gaza, U.N. officials said.
Ging expressed frustration with the Israeli military, which he said cleared the convoy to travel into Gaza.
Ging said an Israeli liaison did not dispute that Israeli forces fired on the vehicle.
Three Israeli civilians and one of those soldiers have been killed in rocket strikes from Gaza.
More than 20 rockets were fired into Israel on Thursday, Israeli police said.
Mohammed Hamid, a Palestinian driver, told CNN Israeli forces are stopping ambulances evacuating the wounded.
A three-hour truce on Wednesday was also marred by fighting which Israeli officials said were in retaliation for Hamas attacks on Israeli forces.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
