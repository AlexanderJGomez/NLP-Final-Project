Earlier this week, CNN spoke to four protesters about their hopes, demands and expectations, from a veteran demonstrator in Cairo who has marched in crowds since the beginning of Egypt's revolution in 2011 to a first-time protester in the port city of Alexandria.
[The] square exploded with joy once protesters knew that Morsy was no longer the president.
I would personally prefer that we achieve our goals and demands without any interference from the military.
Those in power [now] should stick to the demands of the people.
People started shaking hands and celebrating after hearing [the] news [of] Morsy's ousting.
This army made it clear, by choosing a civilian to lead the interim process ... that the masses of people would not revolt back at the army as before.
They just protected the people's demands and put the country on the right track.
I'm one of the people who does not want the army to rule the country, so the interim president is the most suitable solution to avoid having the army ruling.
Whoever is in power now should prepare fast for presidential elections and complete the transitional period as early as possible.
