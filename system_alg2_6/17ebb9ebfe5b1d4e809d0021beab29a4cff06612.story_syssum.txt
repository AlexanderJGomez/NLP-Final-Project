He also accused the Damascus regime of collaborating with al Qaeda militants against opponents both in Syria and in neighboring Iraq.
"I was at the top of the Syrian regime," Fares said in his first interview with a U.S.-based TV network since his defection.
There is only one person who gives the orders: one person who is the president," Fares said.
Ghalioun insisted he did not know the former Syrian ambassador was sharing the same quarters.

Instead, he accused Damascus of cooperating closely with al Qaeda militants, ever since the U.S. invasion of neighboring Iraq in 2003.
One of these "safe havens," Fares said, was the Syrian border village of al Sukariya, near the border city of Abu Kamal.
U.S. officials later told CNN that special forces soldiers and helicopter gunships targeted an Iraqi man named Abu Ghadiya, who they called "the top facilitator of al Qaeda foreign fighters into Iraq."
"This was a hiding place for al-Qaeda on the border with Iraq, and it was under the control of Assif Shawkat, the brother-in-law of the president," Fares said.
But he had a message to the Syrian president and his former colleagues in the government.
Two wills cannot be defeated: the will of God and the will of the people.
