"One of 'em, I think, is Sen. Chuck Hagel."
When Hagel was elected to the Senate, the two men shared a bond over their service in Vietnam.
Then, Hagel said his friend felt he owed the country his service.
A source close to McCain said the friends just drifted apart as friends sometimes do, not because of policy differences.
But citing their long friendship, McCain said he would not oppose Hagel before the hearing.
