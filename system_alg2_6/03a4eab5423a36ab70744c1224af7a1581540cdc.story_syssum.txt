Los Angeles (CNN) -- A decision on if researchers can study Junior Seau's brain for clues to the NFL veteran's suicide will wait until his family meets with elders from their Samoan culture, his family said Monday.
Researchers have contacted the Seau family to request the opportunity to study his brain, Mitchell said last week.
He suffered many concussions, so there is a strong sense that it played a role," said Mitchell, who is also the chaplain for the San Diego Chargers, the team for which Seau played 13 seasons.
The only way to determine if Seau suffered CTE is to analyze the brain tissue for "hallmarks of the dementia-like disease," Gupta said.
