As an independent myself, I usually cheer the prospect of any independent campaign.
Especially because a new Washington Post/ABC poll shows that 41% of American voters now identify as independents.
It's perhaps useful to remember that Perot campaigned primarily on reducing the deficit and the debt at a time when America was struggling to get out of a recession and many people thought that Japan was a rising power that would eclipse the United States.
But it will hurt both Trump and the GOP in the long run, while nuking any hope he had of appealing to independent voters.
Trump would not.
Independent voters are now the largest and fastest-growing segment of the electorate.
