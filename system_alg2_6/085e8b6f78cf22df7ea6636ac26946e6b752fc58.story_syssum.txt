(CNN) -- Togo captain Emmanuel Adebayor has labeled as "outrageous" the controversial decision to ban his side from the next two Africa Cup of Nations.
"He said the threat surrounding our squad had not gone and told us to return to our country.
The attack raised fears about security for the World Cup, which takes place in South Africa later this year.
"The decision taken by the political authorities is infringing CAF and CAN (African Nations Cup) regulations.
The Africa Cup of Nations tournament is one of the biggest sporting events in the world this year, and Angola's first since a 2002 peace deal ended decades of civil war in the southern African country.
