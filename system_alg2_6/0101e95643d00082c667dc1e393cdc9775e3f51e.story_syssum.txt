NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A new lawsuit alleges that convicted swindler Bernie Madoff financed a cocaine-fueled work environment and a "culture of sexual deviance," and he diverted money to his London, England, office when he believed federal authorities were closing in at home.
According to the complaint, Madoff transferred funds to London to buy extravagant personal items.
Madoff was fond of escorts and masseuses, and used money stolen from investors to pay them, according to the complaint.
The complaint includes details of Madoff's drastically different life now in prison.
Madoff now spends his time with infamous inmates, the lawsuit says, including Carmine Persico, a former organized-crime former boss, and Jonathan Pollard, a convicted spy for Israel.
"He told us things that were self-serving to him," she said.
