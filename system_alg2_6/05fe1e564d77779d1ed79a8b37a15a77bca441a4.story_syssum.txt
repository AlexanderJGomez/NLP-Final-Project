(CNN) -- A 56-year-old married woman has won half of the second-largest Mega Millions jackpot in U.S. history and has taken the cash option, which after taxes, will be about $120 million, Georgia Lottery President Debbie Alford said Wednesday.
It will take one to two weeks before Curry will get her check, Alford said.
Curry told lottery officials she hadn't had time to think about what to do with the money.
Strong sales boosted the jackpot to $648 million from previous estimates of $636 million and $586 million, lottery officials said.
The odds of hitting the jackpot, which were 1 in 176 million, are now 1 in 259 million.
