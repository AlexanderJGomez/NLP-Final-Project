Farm Radio Malawi is one of the partner stations of Farm Radio International, a non-profit organization that's been teaming up with African radio broadcasters since the late 1970s.
In rural parts of Malawi, farmers often gather at radio listening clubs to tune in and discuss what they've heard.
"Right now we are promoting groundnut growing, not only for food, but for income," says Chapota.
Patrick Chimuvi, a government agriculture advisor in Malawi, says the radio programs have been very successful in helping farmers improve their skills and harvest their produce at the best time.
