Robin Lim, an American woman who has helped thousands of poor Indonesian women have a healthy pregnancy and birth, was named the 2011 CNN Hero of the Year on Sunday night.
"The situation is bad ... babies are unattended, deliveries have become commercialized, and mothers die from hemorrhage after childbirth because they can't afford proper care," Lim told CNN earlier this year.
This is the fifth year that CNN, with the help of entertainers and other celebrities, have honored everyday people changing the world.
"My wish is that every mother all over the world has the same chance surviving childbirth I had.
Turlington Burns recently made the trip to Indonesia to meet Lim and see her work firsthand.
We don't even know how many babies are lost, but all of us can help change that."
Through a local newspaper column and his nonprofit, The Time Is Now To Help, Dimiceli assists about 500 people a year with food, rent, utilities and other necessities.
Since 2009, the Atlanta-based nonprofit has provided about 150,000 bars of soap for communities in 10 countries.
Today, Serato provides dinner seven days a week to more than 300 children at the Boys & Girls Club in Anaheim, California.
