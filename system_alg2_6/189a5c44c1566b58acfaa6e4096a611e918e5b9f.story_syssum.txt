Aasta, Norway (CNN) -- Three rapid blasts echoed across the Norwegian countryside on Tuesday as police detonated explosives found at a farm owned by the suspect in last week's bloodbath in Oslo and the island of Utoya.
Lippestad said Breivik didn't expect to reach Utoya, where he is accused of shooting 68 people dead.
Breivik accused the Labour Party of "treason" for promoting multiculturalism, Heger said.
Lippestad said Breivik had told him he was in touch with two terror cells in Norway and in contact with other cells abroad, but that he acted alone in carrying out the attack on Utoya and the Oslo bombing.
Other countries are involved in the Norwegian investigation into last week's attacks, police said in response to a question about Breivik's claim to have been in contact with terror cells abroad.
"In my darkest moments, I think that rather than killing all those people, he should have taken his own life," Jens Breivik said in an interview with Norway's TV2.
He must be," the father said in response to a reporter's question about whether he thought his son was mentally ill.
"No.
It's been a summer camp for the Labour Party, now it's to be an island for everyone."
According to Heger, Breivik said he worked with two cells to launch the attacks, the deadliest onslaught in Norway since World War II.
Breivik is now "very tired" because of his circumstances, he said, but he was not injured when he was taken into police custody.

Breivik asked to wear a uniform to the court hearing but was not allowed to, Heger said.
The judge said he ordered Breivik held in isolation for the next four weeks to ensure he has no opportunity to tamper with evidence, Heger said.
