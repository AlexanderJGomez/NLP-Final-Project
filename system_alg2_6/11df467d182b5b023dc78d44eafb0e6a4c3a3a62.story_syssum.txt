(CNN) -- Here's what Katie Roche expected when she went into the hospital for spine surgery: two titanium rods, a bone graft, 17 screws in her vertebrae, eight hours in the operating room, and a week's stay in the hospital to recover.
The study found Clostridium difficile infections in hospitalized children went up 15% per year from 1997, when there were 3,565 infections, to 2006, when there were 7,779 infections.
Doctors found Katie had an infection -- not C. diff, but another bacterium -- and did a surgery to clear it up.
Katie and her parents didn't know it, but her situation was the perfect storm for a C. diff infection.
