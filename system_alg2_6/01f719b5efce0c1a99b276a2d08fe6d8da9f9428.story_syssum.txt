Retinitis pigmentosa has seriously impaired his vision.
Lidsky, 28, will work with the retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and will be assured of long days writing and researching cases.
The symptoms were slow to develop, so Lidsky came to terms early with the idea of losing his vision.
" he said.
Becoming a Supreme Court law clerk, he said, was a lifelong dream.
"You could tell things were getting worse," Ambro said.
With the recommendations of Ambro and others, Lidsky applied four times to be a Supreme Court law clerk but was rejected.
"I have no doubt Justice O'Connor will keep me very busy," Lidsky said.
O'Connor also will continue her practice of sitting in on several appeals court cases a year, so Lidsky will assist her on those, along with the 78-year-old's busy schedule of teaching, speeches and public advocacy.
"In 10 or 15 years, I would bet he will be a man still on your radar screen," Ambro predicts.
