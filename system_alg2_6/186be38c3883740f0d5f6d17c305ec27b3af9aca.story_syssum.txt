Thousands of people tuned in last weekend to watch as two tiny eaglets emerged from their carefully-guarded eggs, thanks to a live streaming Eagle Cam installed by the school.
"People are personally invested," said Christine Reinolds Kozelle, director of news and editorial services at Berry College.
We had no idea it would be this popular.
Kozelle said there have been over 20 million views since the livestream was set up last year.
But school officials point out that this natural behavior for eaglets.
"It's very common when there is more than one sibling for one to dominate," Kozelle said.
The eagles bring thousands of visitors to the campus of Berry College.
