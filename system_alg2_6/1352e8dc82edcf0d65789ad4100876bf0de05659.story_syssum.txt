(Tribune Media Services) -- If you think being a secret agent is all just one giant adrenaline rush, think again.
But I've got a bigger mission ahead this weekend: Can I make a visit to the nation's capital, museums and historic sites at every turn, fun?
I've brought along two sixth-graders from Stamford, Connecticut -- my cousin's son, Max Weinberg, and his friend, Miles Singer -- to see if I'm up to the challenge.
The theme of this hotel is "art in motion" and when we get to our room, the kids find personalized cartoons drawn by a local cartoonist and an iHome to plug in their iPods.
Fall and winter weekends are a great time to visit D.C. with bargain hotel rates.
(TIP: Even in the fall, the entire day's tickets had been given out before 10 a.m.
NOTE: Though (free) tickets aren't required September through February, tours still fill up.
Me too.
