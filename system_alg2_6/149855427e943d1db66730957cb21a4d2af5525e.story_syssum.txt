CIA contract security officers who responded to the terrorist attacks on the U.S. ambassador in Benghazi, Libya, last year were told by the CIA to sign nondisclosure agreements just before a memorial ceremony at the CIA's headquarters in Langley, Virginia, this past May, a congressional source told CNN.
"CIA contractors routinely sign secrecy agreements, which are standard forms.
Mark Zaid, an attorney representing three of the CIA contractors, told the Weekly Standard, "There is no doubt that the NDAs (nondisclosure agreements) would not have been presented to them had it not been for Benghazi.
CNN has learned a rescue team of five CIA operatives were armed and ready to respond to the terrorist attack within minutes of the first  radio communication from Ambassador Christopher Stevens' compound, but CNN sources say the agents were told to stand down.
Members of the House Intelligence Subcommittee believe they need to have more information to determine why a discrepancy now exists between the would-be rescuers on the ground and the official reports from the CIA.
