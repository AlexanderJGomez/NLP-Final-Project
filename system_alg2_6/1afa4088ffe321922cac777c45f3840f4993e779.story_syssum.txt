Music preservationist Curtis Blues works the streets of Old Town Alexandria, Virginia.
"This is a one-string diddley bow," Blues says as he picks up a crude, homemade instrument constructed from items you might find in any kitchen.
Blues started playing blues harmonica when he was 14 years old, and he has been studying, learning and performing blues music ever since.
One of the aspects of my preservation work is to preserve the voice of these unique instruments of this era."
For the past 14 years, Blues has had a one-man-band blues show that he performs in the shadow of the Old Torpedo Factory, located on the boardwalk in the heart of Old Town.
"Would you like to be part of my band?"
Near the end of the song, Blues lowers the music and addresses the crowd.
He stands up and sings a classic blues song called "Turkey-Legged Woman" and begins to engage the crowd face to face.
Blues says he will play on the street "as long as there are people here to stop and listen."
