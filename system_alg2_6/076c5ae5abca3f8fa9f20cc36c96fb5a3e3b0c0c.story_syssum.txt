Husien Shehada, at left with his brother, Samer, was shot dead by Miami Beach police on June 14.
Although it is not yet clear whether Tavss fired one of the shots that killed McCoy, questions are being raised as to whether the officer was cleared for patrol duty too soon after the first shooting.
Miami Beach Police Chief Carlos Noriega has defended both shootings.
Each of the nation's 20,000 police departments sets its own policy for police involved in shootings and fatalities.
A study by the Justice Department's National Institute of Justice found that officers involved in fatal shootings can be affected for months afterward.
In some cases, the study found, officers could not recall firing their weapons.
Investigators said they believe that the two brothers were looking for revenge against those men when somebody called 911, reporting that two men were walking down the street and that one of them might be carrying a machine gun.
Samer Shehada said he and his brother were cooperating.
He said the two men cursed at police and wouldn't put their hands up.

McCoy was shot dead by police.
Police found a gun several days later in Biscayne Bay, but they say they don't know if it belonged to McCoy.
"In fairness to the officer, you don't put him on the street, with a gun and a badge, to be in this situation without allowing for a period of decompression -- for the officer's sake, to get some help," Contini said.
