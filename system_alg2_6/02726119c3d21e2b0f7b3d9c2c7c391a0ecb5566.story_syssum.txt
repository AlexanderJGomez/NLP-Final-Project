Time said Bernanke was the reason the U.S. financial crisis wasn't worse.
Michael Grunwald, who authored Time's article, on Wednesday told NBC's "Today" that "basically [Bernanke] saw what looked like another depression coming, and he decided he would do whatever it takes to forestall that.
Wednesday's announcement comes a day before a Senate Banking Committee vote on whether Bernanke should be given another term.
Another sharp critic of Bernanke, independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, said December 2 that he plans to place a "hold" on Bernanke's nomination for a second term once it leaves the Banking Committee.
Bernanke was sworn in as Federal Reserve chairman in February 2006.
