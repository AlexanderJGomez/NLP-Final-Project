Washington (CNN) -- Mitt Romney's solid debate performance Wednesday night gives him the type of energy and momentum that President Barack Obama now will have to work overtime to undo.
"Obama can afford to lose this one," said Melissa Wade, a debate professor at Emory University in Atlanta.
"Romney has a message and he was finally able to deliver it.
"He was terrible last night and I don't understand why," Geer said.
Obama made unforced errors.
"If you want to be president, you owe the American people the truth," Obama said during a campaign stop in Denver.
The Romney campaign spent much of September trying to recover from a series of gaffes ranging from his assertion that 47% of people were entitlement-dependent supporters of Obama to his politically-charged response to the violent attacks on U.S. embassies in Egypt and Libya.
And last night he was able to elevate his level of performance.
The town hall format is one that could easily trip both candidates, debate experts say.
"The danger of the town hall is that you're getting them from the audience," Wade said.
