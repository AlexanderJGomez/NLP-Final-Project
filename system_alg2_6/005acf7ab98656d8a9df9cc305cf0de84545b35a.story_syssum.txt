LONDON, England (CNN) -- London commuters crammed onto buses, scrambled for taxis, cycled or simply walked on Wednesday as a strike by Tube workers shut down most of the subway network.
Transport Commissioner Peter Hardy said the talks had been making progress on all issues and he urged the RMT to return to the table.
While most services on the Tube were shut because of the strike, one line -- the Northern line -- was running normally and five others were running on a reduced schedule, TfL said.
The RMT represents about half of the 20,000 employees on the Tube, a TfL spokeswoman said.
