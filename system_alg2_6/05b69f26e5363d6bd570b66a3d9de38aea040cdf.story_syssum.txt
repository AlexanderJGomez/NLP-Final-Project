Three European nations were notified about concerns over horse meat as early as a year ago, the United Kingdom's food safety agency said Sunday.
The horse meat was sent from Denmark to Italy and officials sent out the alert to let Italian authorities know about their concerns about the paperwork, not the meat itself, Kim Sigsgaard said.
Of 2,501 tests carried out on beef products across the industry by noon Friday, 2,472 found no horse meat content above 1%, the Food Standards Agency said.
Fifteen of the positive tests were for the lasagna products sold by Findus that first triggered the current horse meat buzz in early February.
Authorities across Europe have been scrambling to get a grip on the crisis over rogue horse meat in beef products.
Jewish dietary laws also ban the eating of horse meat.
