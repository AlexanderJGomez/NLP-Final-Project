Since its start as the multimedia portion of the SXSW Film Festival in 1994, the event -- which runs Friday through Tuesday -- has its roots in community-driven tech creativity.
Both events were turning points for SXSW Interactive -- known to festival veterans as "South By" -- which at the time was still recovering from some lean years after the dot-com bust.
They're tasked with deciding what the future of Interactive will be in the face of more people, more programming and more interest in what is the festival's hot new tech.
"One of the tensions we faced this year is we've got lots and lots of the start-up stuff and that's very exciting, but at the same time, it's not completely what we're about."
For the first time, the festival will give out a Hall of Fame award at its Interactive Awards ceremony.
The 2011 festival also attracted the attention of Apple, which opened a pop-up store in downtown Austin to accommodate crowds clamoring for its just-launched iPad 2.
Like any ambitious 19-year-old, SXSW Interactive is restless, driven and hard to pigeonhole.
The festival may be unsure where it will end up, but it's convinced it knows how to get there.
