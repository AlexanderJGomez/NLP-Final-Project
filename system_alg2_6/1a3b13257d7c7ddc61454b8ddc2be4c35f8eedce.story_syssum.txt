Washington (CNN) -- A judge on Monday ordered the release of sealed documents and transcripts from court proceedings related to the murder case of Chandra Levy, a Washington intern whose disappearance in 2001 drew national headlines and damaged a U.S. congressman's political career.
Guandique's defense attorney, Jonathan Anderson, on Monday questioned Morales' credibility and said he had given contradictory testimony about Guandique.
Condit denied he and Levy were having an affair, but an FBI forensic expert later confirmed his semen was found in Levy's underwear that was retrieved from her apartment after she went missing.
Condit, who served in Congress until 2003, is currently on the board of directors of the Phoenix Institute of Desert Agriculture, a nonprofit group that promotes sustainable farming.
