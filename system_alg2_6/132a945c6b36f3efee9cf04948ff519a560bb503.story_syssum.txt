Astronomical Society meetings are terrific for learning about the latest research, networking with colleagues, recruiting graduate students or forming new research collaborations.
That's because many colleagues who work for federal agencies like the National Science Foundation and NASA have been told to stay home.
Hundreds of thousands of scientists work in the federal government.
Science is no different.
Let's be clear: Not only can't government employees travel to meetings on the government's dime, they can't present the results of their scientific research at all, even if they take vacation days and pay for the travel.
In many disciplines, 10 proposals for new research projects are rejected for every one that is funded.
Astronomy research experiences for undergraduates -- funded by the National Science Foundation, among others -- are an effective way to retain students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math, or STEM, majors.
So our short-sighted policies are preventing government scientists from conducting the best possible research, not to mention losing U.S. leadership in important international efforts.
