Last week, Jack Taylor, a 5-foot, 10-inch guard at Iowa's Grinnell College, scored 138 points to lead Grinnell to a 179-104 blowout win over Faith Baptist Bible College, a nearby Iowa college.
Taylor is not the first basketball player to go on such an outsized scoring spree.
In the National Basketball Association, the scoring record belongs to the Philadelphia Warriors' Wilt Chamberlain.
That was not the case in the Grinnell game.
What the basketball players at Faith Baptist Bible College must be feeling about losing by 75 points doesn't seem to have entered anyone's head at Grinnell or in the media, which couldn't get enough of Taylor in the days following his scoring feat.
We knew these unspoken rules by 16.
But I wish that the Grinnell players had had my old coach, who doubled as my math teacher.
