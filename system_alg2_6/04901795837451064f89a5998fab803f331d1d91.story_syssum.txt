Robert Lewandowski, the Poland striker, was already one of the most feared forwards in European football before his took the field.
"The first 25 minutes were great and then we lost a bit of our game.
Go back to the strong first 25 minutes'."
Lewandowski led the line, a lone warrior refusing to be tamed by a Real defense appearing more and more desperate as the night progressed.
Just seven minutes had elapsed when the wonderfully talented Reus danced his way through the Real defense, before unleashing a rasping effort which was parried away by Diego Lopez.
But whatever Klopp said to his side at the break worked a treat as they produced one of the most enthralling second half displays in recent times.
That fourth goal was not far away, however, and when Xavi Alonso fouled Reus inside the penalty area, Lewandowski stood up to power home from 12-yards.
"I think Dortmund were the best team by far," Real boss Mourinho told Sky Sports.
"We know everything about Robert Lewandowski, every detail possible and we lost him in three goals.
They are a great side."
