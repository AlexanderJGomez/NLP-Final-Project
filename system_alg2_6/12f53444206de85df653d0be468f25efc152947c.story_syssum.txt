After killing a man at an Ohio Walmart, police interrogated his girlfriend, accusing her of lying, threatening her with jail time and suggesting she could be on drugs, according to a video obtained by CNN.
In the interrogation video, which was first posted on The Guardian's website on Sunday, a police detective repeatedly presses Crawford's tearful girlfriend, asking her where Crawford got the gun he had in the store.
"Not that I.
...
"I don't know any other way to tell you," Curd says.
In a statement officials released in September, Curd describes his questioning of Thomas at the police department.
The family alleges, among other things, that the police officers did not do due diligence to determine that Wright wasn't a threat; that the officers didn't give him enough time to put down the weapon; and that Walmart was negligent because the air rifle had been resting on a shelf, unpackaged, for at least two days, the family's lawyers said Tuesday.
Wright said police knew Crawford didn't have a firearm when he walked into the Walmart.
But Wright said that because Crawford was black, police made assumptions.
