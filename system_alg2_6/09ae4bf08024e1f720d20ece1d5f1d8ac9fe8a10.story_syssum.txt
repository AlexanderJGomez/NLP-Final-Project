It will be unlike any other race in its 32-year history, as thousands of competitors and spectators observe a 30-second silence ahead of the starting gun, in remembrance of Boston's casualties.
That defiance is shared by the thousands of competitors who run the London Marathon to raise money for myriad charities.
Security will also be stepped-up at the event, which is the first international marathon to follow Boston.
"You will know from London 2012 last year, this country has a great deal of experience of ensuring our sporting events go well and that security is at the heart of the planning process.
Similarly, reigning marathon champion, Wilson Kipsang, told competitors to try and put security issues out of their minds as they wind their way along the 42 kilometer route from Blackheath to Buckingham Palace, home of the Queen.
