Jakes says the church must sound the alarm to wake America from its slumber.
I personally wish the distinctions of the church by ethnicity would one day become an antiquated idea.
And because I know that many Americans unfortunately do not venture outside of the comfort of their own groups for worship, the only understanding some will have of who we are is based largely on sound bites and media portrayals.
The church I have read about in the media -- a church filled with divisiveness, a lack of tolerance for other ethnic groups, a church not focused on helping the downtrodden and less fortunate, a church filled with hostility -- does not remotely resemble the churches that I grew up around and have loved for more than 50 years.
Gradually race fades into the fabric of faith and becomes less central to the overarching core of human needs in general.
But the core message is not one that enrages, but one that encourages people to change and grow, and any other depiction is distorted and inaccurate.
I am wondering who will get the message that our nation's citizens are by and large looking for a voice that will unite us, clothe our naked, feed the poor and help our diminishing middle class before we self-destruct like many great empires of the past.
To be sure, there is still work to do to defeat racism and to attain justice in our country for all.
But there is no liberation without love, no prosperity without philanthropy and no hope if the church becomes immersed in the quagmire of pettiness.
My hope is that the church remains a vibrant part of our process, sounding the alarm that warns: America, please wake up out of our sleep!
