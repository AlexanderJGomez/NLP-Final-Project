(CNN)Talk show host Dr. Mehmet Oz is defending himself against a group of doctors who accuse him of "manifesting an egregious lack of integrity" in his TV and promotional work and who call his faculty position at Columbia University unacceptable.
It all started when a group of 10 physicians from across the country emailed a letter to Columbia University expressing disapproval that Oz is on the faculty.
The FDA disputed the findings and said the report was misleading and irresponsible.
Miller and the other doctors who signed the email echo that sentiment, saying Oz is misleading the public and they tell Columbia's Goldman that having him on the faculty is unacceptable.
Orlando, Florida, anesthesiologist Dr. Shelley Fleet told CNN when she received an email from Miller inviting her to sign the email to Columbia, she said of course.
Oz spokesman Tim Sullivan sent an email to CNN last week listing the names of five of the 10 people who complained about Oz.
A cardiac surgeon, Oz came to Columbia for his residency after medical school in 1986 and rose through the ranks.
