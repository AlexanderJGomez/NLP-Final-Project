Zahra Rahnavard, wife of Iranian candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi, has taken a visible role in the campaign.
More women than men have voted in the past few elections, and Rahnavard has made a promise to her female supporters that their vote will count this time if Moussavi wins.
"We have made this promise to the women, and we will stand by it," she said.
Moussavi is not the only candidate calling for a stronger role for women in Iran.
"This is the first time after the revolution we see a lady behind the president," Farhad Mahmoudi said.
"And this is why we're so happy, because we can have a first lady."
