"Argo," which cost $45 million to make, has now earned $60.8 million total, and thanks to terrific word-of-mouth (the film earned an "A+" CinemaScore grade) and early awards buzz, Argo is eyeing a $100 million finish.
("The Town," which opened higher "Argo" with $23.8 million, fell 38 percent to $9.7 million in its third weekend.)
Audiences, which were 77 percent above the age of 25, issued the film a "C+" CinemaScore.
After ten days, Paramount's $5 million found footage sequel has earned $42.6 million, which is still $10 million less than PA3 grossed in its first weekend.
