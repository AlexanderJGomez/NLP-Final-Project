Madeline Loftus, known as Maddy, was one of 49 people to die aboard Continental Connection Flight 3407 last Thursday.
She was returning to Buffalo State College to play in a reunion hockey game on Saturday, to meet up with her old classmates to play the game she loved so dearly.
Loftus' No.
She will always hold a special place in my heart," said Terry Mannor, St. Mary's women's hockey coach.
About 1,000 people gathered at a church in western New York Monday to remember the crash victims.
All 49 passengers and crew members aboard the 74-seat turboprop were killed when the plane crashed into a home in Clarence Center, New York, on Thursday night.
This would have been her first time on the ice with her former Buffalo State teammates since her playing days.
So passionate about hockey, Loftus was the first female to play on the boys' team in high school.
"Maddy was enthusiastic about life and especially about women's hockey."
