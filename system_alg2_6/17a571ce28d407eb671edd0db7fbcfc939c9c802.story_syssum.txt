The Hugo Awards were being streamed live on video site Ustream when, at 10:43 p.m.
"Our editorial team and content monitors almost immediately noticed a flood of livid Twitter messages about the ban and attempted to restore the broadcast," Brad Hunstable, CEO and founder of Ustream, wrote on the site's blog.
He said the automated system has been suspended until Ustream is able to "better balance the needs of broadcasters, viewers, and copyright holders."
Named after Hugo Gernsback, the editor of groundbreaking sci-fi magazine Amazing Stories, the Hugos (originally the Science Fiction Achievement Awards) have been awarded annually for science fiction and fantasy writing since 1953.
