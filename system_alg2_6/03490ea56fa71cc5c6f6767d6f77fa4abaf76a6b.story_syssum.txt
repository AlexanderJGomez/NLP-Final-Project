"It's a trade-based solution to the global problem of marine pollution," says Julie Church, the co-founder of Ocean Sole.
"It gets people to think about the ocean and links them to waterways -- and we're doing it through business."
"Pollution in all our waterways is a big problem," says Church, who was born and raised in Kenya.
But, with curious fascination, Church also watched how local children used this marine debris -- cast-off flip-flops and other junk they'd found by the sea -- to create their own toys to play with.
There, Ocean Sole workers go through large bags full of broken flip-flops every day to select the ones they're going to use in their creations.
Church says that Ocean Sole is for her "a means to an end," a more effective way to spread her green message than working as a marine conservationist.
