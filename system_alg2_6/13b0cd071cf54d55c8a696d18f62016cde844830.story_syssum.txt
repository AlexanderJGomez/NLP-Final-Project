Using game theory and data analytics, a group of political scientists predicted Egypt's current turmoil back in 2011 as the Mubarak regime was falling, and is now working to forecast the country's future.
"In November 2011, what we showed was even though the majority of the Egyptian society was in favor of ousting Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian military was at the time going to support the newly elected regime, but not fully accept it for a long-term solution."
"The military will continue to be pro-American, because of its reliance on U.S. foreign aid and military assistance, and the Egyptians who would be running in the future will be smart enough not to bring conflict with the U.S.," said Ashraf Singer, a member of the Egyptian Council for Foreign Affairs who has also worked closely with Egyptian government officials.
U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday refrained from calling Morsy's ouster a "coup," as such a statement would legally oblige the U.S. to stop the flow of military aid to Egypt.
