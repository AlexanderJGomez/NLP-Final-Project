Jerusalem (CNN) -- Police who are investigating a major wildfire in northern Israel have detained a 14-year-old boy who admitted smoking a water pipe in the woods near his village, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
"I do not want delays," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday.
A plan will also be formulated to restore animal and plant life affected in the Carmel Nature Reserve.
In an interview with the newspaper, a firefighter spokesman said the bus was gone in less than three minutes.
The fire has also threatened a sensitive ecological area near the Hai Bar nature reserve.
