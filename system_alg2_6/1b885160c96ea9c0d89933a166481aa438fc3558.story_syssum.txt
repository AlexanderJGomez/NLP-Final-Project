For Wang is one of the few insiders who dare to speak publicly about something most people in China only whisper about: the fall of the man once touted as a potential Chinese president.
Wang says it all leads back to Bo Xilai, a man known in China as a "princeling," the son of a communist revolutionary hero.
The insider, Wang, says the crackdown went too far.
Wang says Bo tried to recreate the Mao era and frightened communist reformers, making new enemies.
This particular path has lead to Bo's own ruin.
Heywood, who was married to a Chinese woman, then befriended Bo and his wife Gu Kailai.
"It's said in the official report that Gu was involved in the murder of Heywood.
My guess is both factors exist.
One leader has fallen, but Wang says China may have taken big steps to saving itself in the process.
