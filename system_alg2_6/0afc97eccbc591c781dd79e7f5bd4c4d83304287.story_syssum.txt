Specifically, Congress hasn't passed a budget in almost four years.
If members of Congress can't pass a budget on time, they wouldn't get paid until they did.
But somehow, breaking the laws they set for themselves doesn't seem to be an urgent concern to these Congresscrats, despite the fact that the U.S. government spent $3.7 trillion last year (PDF).
The proposal was the cornerstone of the "Make Congress Work" plan released last year.
"No Budget, No Pay" is a no-brainer.
Congress is now the greatest single impediment to American economic recovery, in large part because a bloc of 50 or so votes on the far right seems enamored with playing chicken with our country's full faith and credit.
But the House GOP vote to at least extend the debt-ceiling deadline and impose a common sense measure like "No Budget, No Pay" is sign of sanity at the start of the second Obama term.
