In one sense, it's just walking, but it takes me to new heights, literally.
I started lifting weights many years ago, and I've always enjoyed it.
I take new routes coming into the city so there's always something novel and interesting to look at -- new architecture, a field, or a reservoir I hadn't seen before.
I like cards but have really never had a lot of that "downtime" to engage in poker or bridge or even canasta.
Honestly, I had no idea how many friends she had!
Keep a list of things you want to do or feel you must do during your lifetime -- and then checking them off before you kick the bucket -- is a really good thing.
It is one of those places I will never forget.
Life is a pile of problems that have to be solved one way or another, and the best way is to look at each one individually, figure it out, and move on.
I like to walk on all different kinds of surfaces, particularly when I hike.
Get those appointments on you calendar now if you haven't already -- and see how good it feels to take charge of your health.
