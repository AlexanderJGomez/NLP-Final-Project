The runoff was triggered because no candidate garnered 50% of the vote in the first primary, which Cochran lost to McDaniel by some 1,000 votes.
The tea party has become code for "racist" among many black Americans, who overwhelmingly vote Democratic.
It's true these same voters will likely vote for the Democratic nominee in the fall.
While I don't agree with how Cochran won and wish blacks were more informed about their vote, Cochran bothered to ask blacks to vote for him, something that apparently makes some Republicans cringe.
Cochran will run in the general election ignoring black voters, just as the GOP has done for the past 40 years.
Cochran demonstrates what many black conservatives already know: GOP candidates will only reach out to black voters, kicking and screaming, as a last resort to win.
