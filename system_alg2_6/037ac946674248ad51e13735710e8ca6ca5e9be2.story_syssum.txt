As is often the case with best-laid plans, however, I soon discovered an unexpected goal within my temporary career: the pursuit of excellence as a way of life.
"People treat temps like dirt," they scoffed.
"They aren't being excellent to each other!"
"Be excellent to each other!"
Some people ignored the sign (and the intention).
For example, seemingly endless sit-at-the-receptionist-desk moments prompted me to be aware of when someone needed a sympathetic ear.
During mundane moments, I came to understand that excellence wasn't about being perfect or about being nice so people would like me.
First I wrote two books on what Buddhists call right livelihood -- earning a living without doing harm -- hoping that others might benefit from what I had learned.
Now, instead of a sign, I carry excellence within me as a mantra, as a presence.
