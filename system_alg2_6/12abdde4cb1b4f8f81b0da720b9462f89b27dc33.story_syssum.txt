The court -- not the department or the state Board of Parole Hearings -- has the final say on whether Atkins should be released, Thornton said.
Her request is now before the Board of Parole Hearings, which is conducting an independent investigation and will hear the case during its monthly public meeting, Thornton said.
It also can recall her life sentence and resentence Atkins to a lesser term, allowing for her to be paroled.
She also has had a leg amputated, the Los Angeles Times has reported.
Atkins, like family leader Charles Manson, received a death sentence.
Atkins is a born-again Christian, according to a Web site maintained by her husband.
