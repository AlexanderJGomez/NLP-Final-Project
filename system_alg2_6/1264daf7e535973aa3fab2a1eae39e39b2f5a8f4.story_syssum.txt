(CNN) -- Standard Chartered has agreed to pay a $340 million fine to New York banking regulators to settle charges it laundered money for Iranian clients -- but the UK bank is far from the only one to be implicated in illegal transactions with sanctioned nations.
Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) has agreed to pay the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) $340 million to settle charges that the British bank concealed over $250 billion in transactions with Iranian clients and deliberately lied to New York banking regulators.
Then, this June, ING Bank paid the largest ever fine -- $619 million -- against a bank for allegedly moving billions illegally through the U.S. financial system on behalf of Iranian and Cuban clients.
Why not?
Could criminal prosecution of senior bank officials result in the ultimate collapse of the bank?
If SCB allegedly laundered $250 billion for Iranian clients, why did regulators only fine the bank a paltry $340 million?
Perhaps New York regulators were under mounting criticism and pressure from federal authorities for taking unilateral action against SCB and DFS wanted to resolve the case as quickly as possible.
Is the ultimate penalty imposed against offending banks going to be more or less severe than sanctions imposed by the federal authorities?
In the end, the justice system cannot tolerate a dual system of justice, exempting corrupt bank officials from prosecution for fear of negative economic repercussions.
To do otherwise contributes to an environment of impunity and threatens the integrity of the global financial system.
