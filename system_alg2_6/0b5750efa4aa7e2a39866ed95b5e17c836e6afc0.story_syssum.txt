Released this week, the National Sleep Foundation's annual poll estimated that Americans get an average of about 6.7 hours of sleep during a weekday.
Over the last decade, the poll indicates that a growing percentage of Americans is getting less than six hours of sleep and the number of people who get eight or more hours is dwindling.
The economy is a major factor why people are losing sleep."
The mean hours of sleep on a weeknight dwindled from an average of 7 hours in 2001 to 6.7 hours this year, according to the Sleep Foundation's poll.
But now, only about a quarter in the survey reported getting eight or more hours of sleep.
But there is contradicting research on how much sleep Americans are getting.
"I can't believe that people get that much sleep in this busy world of ours," Kavey said.
"You may actually sleep four hours, but you're in bed for eight hours," said Drake, who is a board member with the National Sleep Foundation.
"That's a bad loan," Kavey said.
"Our society has valued people who brag about being able to function on very little sleep as a mark of someone who is aggressive, dynamic, successful," Kavey said.
