"It is an accusation that does not seem very true, because my son was never involved in any terrorist acts," father Juan Jose Pimentel, 51, told CNN en Espa√±ol Tuesday.
But he has been a happy and normal boy and never had any problem with terrorism," Juan Jose Pimentel said.
He allegedly told police he was an hour away from completing his first bomb when he was arrested, according to the complaint.
Jose Pimentel, also known as Muhammad Yusuf, according to the criminal complaint, had a "very active and very public online profile," prosecutors said.
