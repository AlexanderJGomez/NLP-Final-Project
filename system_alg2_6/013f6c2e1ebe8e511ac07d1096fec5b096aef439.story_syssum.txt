I've consistently faced "random" selections for extra screening at the airport after I decided to wear the hijab, or Muslim head covering.
Muslim women wear the hijab as a symbol of modesty, to be judged not by their appearance.
Do they seriously have a blank check on our bodies?
For people who aren't affected by racial profiling at airports, imagine this: The TSA implements a new rule to counter drunken driving, which kills over 13,000 Americans every year.
You also run into problems when you justify profiling nearly one in every four people in the world.
There are some people who don't know Muslims and are numb to realizing the effects of profiling.
There are some Americans who think Muslims are terrorists and some Muslims who think that other Americans are willfully ignorant.
Religious profiling boxes Muslims into a category separate from Americans.
