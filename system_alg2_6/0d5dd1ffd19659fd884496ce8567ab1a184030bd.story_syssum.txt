are methods that are absolutely non-existent in the NDS (National Directorate of Security)," the government said.
UNAMA said officials with Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security "systematically tortured detainees in a number of detention facilities across Afghanistan.
Canada and the United Kingdom ceased transfers of detainees to facilities in Kandahar and Kabul at various times based on reports of torture and ill treatment, the report said.
We are happy that this report also testifies in a part that torture did not take place in a systematic manner in all NDS headquarters."
