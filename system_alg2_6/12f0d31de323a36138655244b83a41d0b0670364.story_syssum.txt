Several veteran shows were among the nominees for best drama series, including "Mad Men" -- which has won this category four years running -- "Boardwalk Empire," "Breaking Bad" and "Game of Thrones."
Thanks to the showings of "Thrones," "Girls," "Empire" and the movie "Game Change," HBO led all networks with 81 nominations.
NBC's "Parks and Recreation" missed out on best comedy series as well, though star Amy Poehler got a nomination.
Don Cheadle, whose Showtime series "House of Lies" received an uneven reception upon its January premiere, earned a nomination for best actor in a comedy series.
(Her comedy series, "Hot in Cleveland," also got recognition, with two nominations.)
The nominations were announced by Kerry Washington, star of ABC's "Scandal," and late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.
The show will air on ABC from Los Angeles' Nokia Theatre.
