(CNN) -- A year ago Wednesday, Malala Yousafzai was riding the bus home from school when a Taliban gunman climbed aboard and shot her in the head.
They banned girls from schools in the Swat Valley in 2009.
"I'll tell him how important education is, and that I even want education for your children as well," she said Tuesday.
Fighting the Taliban is important, but through peace, dialogue and education, she said.
Doctors fought to save her life, then her condition took a dip.
Beyond her hospital room in her new home in the UK, a world sympathetic with her ordeal transformed her into a global symbol.
This year, the Malala Fund was created to support education for girls around the world.
