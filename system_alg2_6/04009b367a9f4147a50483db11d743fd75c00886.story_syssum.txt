Normally, the Atlantic would see its first hurricane by August 10, and a major hurricane (Category 3 or higher) by September 4.
Although the number of 2013 Atlantic storms is above average -- at nine so far -- the intensity of those storms hasn't matched the forecasts.
"The forecast up to now is a bust," says Gray.
Even with the most sophisticated prediction techniques, Gray says, "there's still 40 or 50% of variations in tropical storm and hurricane activity that we can't explain."
Then in August, it dialed down that initial forecast to predict 13 to 19 named storms, including six to nine hurricanes.
According to the weather service forecast, at least four more tropical storms or hurricanes will form in the next 11 weeks.
-In 2002, Gustav, the first hurricane of the season, didn't occur until September.
There's also always the possibility of a freak storm after the season ends, says Vaccaro.
This year, according to the ratings, storm activity in all the world's ocean basins is below normal.
--This year there is no El Niño, which would keep the season quiet, or La Niña, which would fuel a more active season.
At the National Hurricane Center in Miami, they're comparing this year to "a slow first half of a slow football game," says hurricane center spokesman Dennis Feltgen.
Be prepared.
"We'll figure it out," says Gray.
