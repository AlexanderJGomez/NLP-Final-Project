EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy told the Republican-led committee that the agency cannot access some e-mails belonging to a biologist who worked on a controversial mining project assessment.
McCarthy insisted the agency is trying to recover the biologists' missing e-mails, but also tried to downplay his role in the mine assessment.
Meadows pressed McCarthy on whether the agency broke federal records-keeping law.
McCarthy answered that the EPA notified the National Archives and Records Administration about the hard drive problem Tuesday.
"I hope that over the next few days our folks and your folks can resolve this with all the e-mails," Issa concluded.
