Officers sent to check on Paul Ciancia's welfare arrived at his apartment less than an hour after the shooting started, police said Monday.
According to someone who knew Ciancia and his three roommates well, Ciancia began asking for a ride to the airport days before the shooting.
It sounded as if Paul Ciancia in California was thinking about harming himself, so obviously I knew I needed to make a phone call to the LAPD," Pennsville Police Chief Allen Cummings told CNN's Jake Tapper on Monday.
Andy Smith says police were first called to check on Ciancia at 10:06 a.m. Officers arrived at his apartment six minutes later, according to Smith.
He said police had arrived at Ciancia's apartment about 45 minutes after the suspect had left for the airport.
"He took pride in his duty for the American public and for the TSA mission," said his wife, Ana Hernandez.
Two other TSA officers -- James Speer, 54, and Tony Grigsby, 36 -- were wounded but were released from the hospital.
Airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon said the FBI told him that his officers were 60 seconds behind Ciancia.
Holder said Monday that the investigation will include a review of security measures at LAX and other airports.
"It is most important for us as a family to express our deep and sincere sympathy to the Hernandez family," the Ciancia family said.
While we do not mean to minimize the grief and distress experienced by many other families, we hope that the public will understand that this is a very difficult time for our family, too," the family said.
TSA Administrator John Pistole said the shooting has prompted a review of security protocol with partner agencies.
