(CNN)  -- In-form superstars Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi go head-to-head in Monday night's El Clasico between Real Madrid and Barcelona in the Camp Nou, which is set to have a significant bearing on the Spanish title race.
"The Clasico is obviously an important match because we will play against a direct opponent," he told the official Real Madrid website.
My concentration won't falter if the stands are against me.
That's all," claimed Mourinho, who masterminded a Champions League semifinal victory over Barcelona as Inter Milan coach last season.
"Real will come to Camp Nou with revenge in mind," Messi told AFP.
