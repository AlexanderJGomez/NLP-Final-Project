For a company that hasn't attended CES since 1992, Apple dominates the show.
"We know that Apple is doing well," said Howard Cheng, Just Mobile's director of operations.
"Apple owners have a demonstrated willingness to spend for accessories, cases, and other customizations," Govin said.
There's iLounge, iBattz, iSkin, iConnectivity, iPort and even iCat all within a few feet of each other on the show floor.
Meng said that it doesn't matter that Apple isn't at CES with a booth or keynote, because CES is already the most successful and popular show for companies like his.
Just Mobile already has eight products in the Apple Store and uses CES to expand into the international market and meet clients.
"Apple is a CEA member.
But the fact remains that Apple and its products are the widely seen, and discussed, at CES.
