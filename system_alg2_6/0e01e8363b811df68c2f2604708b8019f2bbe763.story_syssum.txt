It's a common malady these days.
Like any machine, a well-maintained car or computer will surprise you, no matter its age.
Check for driver and version updates either at your computer manufacturer's Web site or through the list of software you use frequently; see if new drivers or versions are available.
For this reason, I recommend moving as many of your activities to the Web as possible.
If you're still using Internet Explorer, stop!
Another option takes us back to the Web -- you can often get an online backup plan that will remove your valuable data not only from that main hard drive, but also from your computer's immediate vicinity.
Your old computer, treated with care and respect, can still make that pan-global road trip on the Information Superhighway.
