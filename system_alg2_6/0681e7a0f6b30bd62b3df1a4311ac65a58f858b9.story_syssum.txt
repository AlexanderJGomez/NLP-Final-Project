Rescuers were unable to reach the nursery from the inside and had to break into it from the rooftop, Health Minister Abdullah bin Khalid Al Qahtani told the state news agency QNA.
She said she left when the smoke became "too much."
Along with the children and teachers, two would-be rescuers died in the blaze, Interior Minister Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani said in a statement posted on the ministry's Facebook page.
Four were Spanish nationals, a spokeswoman for Spain's Foreign Ministry said Monday.
Al Thani said everyone was believed to have been accounted for late Monday.
