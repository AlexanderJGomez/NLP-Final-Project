(CNN) -- As many as 100 homes could be affected by flood waters in Wisconsin due to the failure of a 120-year-old sand levee along the Wisconsin River.
Authorities in Portage worked to evacuate residents as the levee approached imminent failure after heavy rainfall soaked the Midwest last week.
The river at Portage is now expected to stay above flood stage -- 17 feet -- through Wednesday, Beghin said.
The Wisconsin River crested around 12 a.m. Monday at 20.56 feet -- roughly 3.5 feet above flood level, according to Beghin and the National Weather Service, putting major pressure on the Caledonia-Lewiston levee system.
"I have never seen the water rage down like it is," CNN iReporter Jason Asselin said.
"Even though some of these rivers have crested ... keep in mind that they're still in flood, so this is going to be a problem for a couple of days," Jeras said.
