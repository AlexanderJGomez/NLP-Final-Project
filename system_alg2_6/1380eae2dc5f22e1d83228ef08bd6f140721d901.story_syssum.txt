Washington (CNN) -- Thousands of protesters held hands and encircled the White House grounds on Sunday, demanding President Barack Obama reject a proposed oil pipeline that would stretch between Canada and Texas.
"We need to remind him he is the leader who we elected," Courtney Hight, a former member of the White House Council on Environmental Quality and now executive director of the Energy Action Coalition, told the crowd.
"Pipelines are the safest, most reliable, economical and environmentally favorable way to transport oil and petroleum products," says the company.
"Folks in Nebraska, like folks all across the country, aren't going to say to themselves, 'We're going to take a few thousand jobs if it means our kids are potentially drinking water that would damage their health,'" Obama said.
"There's a way of doing that and making sure the health and safety of the people of Nebraska are protected," he said.
