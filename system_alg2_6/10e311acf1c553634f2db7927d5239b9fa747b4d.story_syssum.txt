NATO urged Russia to keep its word this time and withdraw troops along Ukraine's eastern border, saying it has seen no signs of soldiers returning to their bases.
"I think it's the third Putin statement on withdrawal of Russian troops ... but so far we haven't seen any withdrawal at all,"  he said.
At that time, NATO and Western officials said they saw no sign of widespread troop withdrawals.
The official said  the White House is monitoring the issue for evidence of withdrawal.
He did not provide any more details.
Over the weekend, the Russian Foreign Ministry accused Ukrainian troops of attacking Ukrainian citizens and questioned whether Sunday's scheduled elections could be held amid the chaos.
