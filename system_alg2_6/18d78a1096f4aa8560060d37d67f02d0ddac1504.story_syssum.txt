(CNN) -- As Apple enthusiasts speculate over why pancreatic cancer survivor Steve Jobs won't appear at Macworld Conference & Expo this year, the CEO asks them to think differently about his health.
There is not enough information available to say how severe a gastrointestinal hormonal problem would be, he said.
Plenty of hormonal conditions, as well as diabetes related to cancer treatment, could be the reason, he said.
If Jobs had a recurrence of this tumor, and it was a functional neuroendocrine tumor, which produces problem-causing hormones, that would be one speculative explanation, Lowy said.
He's saying that's not what he has, and so, I have to take him at his word.
