St. Louis, Missouri, is having to cut back on bus routes.
"To be saddled, to be imprisoned, that is what it is going to feel like," says Stuart Falk.
It was then that St. Louis County voters were asked to vote in favor of a small tax increase to add funding for bus routes and other mass transit operations in the bedroom communities surrounding the city of St. Louis.
Dooley also said mass transit cutbacks make it harder to attract new businesses.
And while many of those affected see it is a perfect use of the federal stimulus funds the president says are meant to create and save jobs, such spending is not allowed.
Without any cash infusion, Metro says it has no choice but to cut back from 9,125 bus stops to 6,801, significantly cutting back its reach into the outer ring of St. Louis County.
One told CNN she optimistic "something will get done about it" but said she isn't sure how she is supposed to get around after Friday.
And the impact goes beyond Metro riders.
