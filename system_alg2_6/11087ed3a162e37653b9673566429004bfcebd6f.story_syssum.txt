The public can view live video of the cub and its mother, Bai Yun, on the zoo's Web site.
Weighing in around 300 pounds, Bai Yun is about 1,000 times the size of her cub, who weighs around 4 ounces., the typical size of a baby panda, Swaisgood said.
She has given birth to four other cubs since arriving at the San Diego Zoo in 1996 from China.
In four to five months, the cub will be ready for the public, Swaisgood said.
