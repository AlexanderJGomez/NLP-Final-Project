Bensalem, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- About 100 vehicles were involved in a series of wrecks on the eastbound Pennsylvania Turnpike just north of Philadelphia on Friday morning, injuring at least 30 people and causing a traffic backup for hours over parts of two counties, officials said.
"I think we really saw mostly what we would call soft-tissue injuries, bumps and scrapes type of injuries," he said.
Heather Pasco, a driver involved in one of the crashes, told KYW that she thought she was a goner.
Police told her that her wreck was about 3.5 miles behind the initial crash, she said.
