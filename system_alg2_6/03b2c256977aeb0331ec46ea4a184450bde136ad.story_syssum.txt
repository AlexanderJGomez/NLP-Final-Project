The Justice Department's announcement this week that it has changed the definition of rape to include men is one such step on the long road to better understanding.
Why?
As the victim in Boston told me: "I don't think that people in general realize the long-term effects that it has on people.
The very reason for the Justice Department's decision is to more accurately count rapes and to better allocate government resources, which up until now did not include programs to help male rape victims.
Clearly, there are still far more women who are raped than men.
For men to be thinking hard about how to be better fathers and husbands can only benefit women, as can the acknowledgment that men are all too often victims of rape.
