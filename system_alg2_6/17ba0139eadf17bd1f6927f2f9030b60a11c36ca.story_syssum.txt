But it's time for Americans to wake up!
Why?
!
Sure, zombie expert Max Brooks, author of the books "The Zombie Survival Guide" and "World War Z," informed me that zombies can't be trained to take our jobs.
Plus, keep in mind that if even only a few zombies make it over the border, these "anchor zombies" will create more and more zombies.
How long after that do you think it will be until these people argue that zombies should be covered under Obamacare?!
Brooks and I did agree that we need the federal government to respond to the dangers posed by an influx of zombies.
I hope my fellow Americans wake up before it's too late.
If not, then I hope the Rosetta Stone starts teaching us how to speak zombie, because we are all going to need it.
