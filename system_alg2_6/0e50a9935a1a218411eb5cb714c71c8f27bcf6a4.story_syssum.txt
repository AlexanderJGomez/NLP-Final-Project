In early January, the fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, met with Bristol County, Massachusetts, prosecutors in what court documents call an immunity meeting, but the results of that meeting are secret, even from the Hernandez defense team.
"Normally, a fiancée is not going to testify adversely against her true love," said Callan, a former New York homicide prosecutor.
Prosecutors suspect Jenkins of following instructions from Hernandez to get rid of the murder weapon from their home by removing the gun inside a box, putting it in a black trash bag, and borrowing her sister's car to take the bag to a dumpster and throw it away.
She has pleaded not guilty.
Jenkins told a grand jury she threw the item in a dumpster but couldn't remember where, according to prosecutors.
"I mean, who knows?"
He must be guilty if even his fiancée would say that,'" said Callan.
Callan suggested that if Jenkins is put on the stand as a prosecution witness and repeats her grand jury testimony that she threw out the item without knowing what was inside and can't remember where she disposed of it, she could put herself in greater legal jeopardy.
