"Nevermind" essentially sowed the seeds for music that defined the 1990s, said Tom Moon, author of  "1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die."
"It was no accident that Alice in Chains, Screaming Trees and bands like that connected in the wake of what Nirvana did," said Moon.
"The musical ideas that Nirvana was about were so powerful they couldn't help but spread."
