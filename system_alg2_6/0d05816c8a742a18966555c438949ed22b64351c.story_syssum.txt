People get killed.
Sandimhia and 1.25 billion other women around the world, find themselves in similar situations every day, where they have no choice but to put themselves at risk of disease, harassment or even violence because they lack access to something as simple as a safe and clean toilet.
Every hour 70 women and girls will needlessly die from diseases directly linked to a lack of an adequate toilet and safe drinking water.
Such words from leaders in diplomacy and in business are hugely welcome.
Almost two billion people have gained access to sanitation since 1990.
Even when this goal is finally reached, one in four people will still not have access to safe sanitation.
World Toilet Day is an opportunity to celebrate the progress that has been made and recognizes how much more needs to be done.
