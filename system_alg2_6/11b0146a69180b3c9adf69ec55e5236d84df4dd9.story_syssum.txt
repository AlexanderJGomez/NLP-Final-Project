Just over a month before that report comes out, R.J. Reynolds and Lorillard filed their lawsuit Friday in U.S. District Court in Washington, naming the Food and Drug Administration, Department of Health and Human Services and those agencies' respective leaders as defendants, as well as the director of the federal Center for Tobacco Products.
It has met approximately once a month since June 2010, with transcripts, webcasts and documents germane to the sessions posted on the FDA website.
But Leonard Jones, director of marketing at Lorillard, said last year that "ethnicity does not play a role" in marketing strategies for the Newport menthol cigarette.
