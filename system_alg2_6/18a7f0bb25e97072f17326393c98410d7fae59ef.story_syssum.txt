Earlier this year he caved into US pressure to pledge he would not overturn the 1993 Kono Statement in which Japan acknowledges its responsibility for the comfort women system, having earlier made noises that he might do so.
Moreover, a month after signaling he would not repudiate the Kono Statement, Abe sent his message praising the war criminals.
