Frankly, I don't know how public figures get through it.
So, somewhat like a National Enquirer reporter who dreams up his day's "scoop" while showering, Drudge teases his readers with innuendo and fluff.
People Magazine did a story on Clinton, and the photographer taking the picture for the front cover asked Clinton to stand by a lawn chair, grab the top, and lean into the camera.
Drudge's tweet fits in with Karl Rove's orchestrated charge in mid-May that maybe Hillary Clinton was "brain damaged" because of a fall she suffered.
"It's better not to argue with women," Putin said, "but Mrs. Clinton has never been too graceful in her statements."
His "It's better not to argue with women," clearly shows Putin learned from his domestic encounters.
Perhaps Putin considers referring to Russia as "despicable" for vetoing U.N. sanctions against Syria, and calling his election possibly fraudulent being "weak."
And, unfortunately, I'm also sure some in the media will be right there with some tweetle-dumb about it.
