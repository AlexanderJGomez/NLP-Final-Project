(CNN) -- Thirteen Boston deputy fire chiefs have signed a letter of "no confidence" in Fire Chief Steve Abraira regarding his handling of the Boston Marathon bombings, according to the letter, which CNN independently obtained from a deputy chief who signed it but requested anonymity.
That's it.
The chief told The Boston Globe that he was comfortable with the way his commanders were handling the incident.
Tsarnaev is being held at Federal Medical Center Devens.
