Bamako, Mali (CNN) -- Islamists in control of northern Mali said they forced a man and a woman into two holes and stoned them to death for committing adultery in the lawless region.
The stoning Sunday is the first reported Sharia killing since al Qaeda-linked Islamists took control of the north.
The two groups now control two-thirds of northern Mali, an area the size of Texas that includes the towns of Gao, Kidal and Timbuktu.
In addition to the killing, Islamist militants have gone on a rampage for months, destroying sacred tombs in the region and vowing to target more.
They especially target Sufi shrines, which they believe are sacrilegious.
