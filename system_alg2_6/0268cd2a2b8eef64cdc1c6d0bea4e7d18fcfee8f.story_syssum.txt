BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN)  -- The operator of a trolley that rear-ended another trolley should have been able to see the other vehicle was stopped 480 feet ahead, a federal investigator said Monday.
Boston officials said over the weekend that the trolley operator was using his cell phone.
The operator told detectives that, when he looked up, "it was too late as he applied the brake and the train struck the other trolley," Grabauskas said.
Both trains were traveling westbound when one train rear-ended the second, an MBTA official said.
