We headed there to see if family members or friends wanted to talk to us about him.
We told her we wanted to do a story about Irianto, that we hoped to find out what kind of husband and father he was; what kind of man and pilot he was.
She told us she wasn't sure if she wanted to talk, but invited us to come back later in the morning.
Widya and Angela, her daughter, invited us to sit down with them, and it was there that they decided they did want to say a few words to us about Irianto.
This family made it very evident they were lucky to have Irianto in their lives.
