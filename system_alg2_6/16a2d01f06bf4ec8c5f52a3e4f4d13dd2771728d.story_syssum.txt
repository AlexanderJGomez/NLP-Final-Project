(CNN) -- Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir asked Arab leaders meeting in Qatar on Monday to strongly reject an arrest warrant issued against him by the International Criminal Court for war crimes.
Sudan expelled 13 international aid agencies from the Darfur region after the ICC issued the arrest warrant.
At the State Department, deputy spokesman Gordon Duguid said leaders at the summit should deal with the situation in Darfur.
"We would hope that while [al-Bashir] is in Doha that the Arab League would focus on the immediate and urgent needs of the people on the ground in Sudan and address the humanitarian situation in Darfur and meet the priorities of the comprehensive peace agreement," he said.
