Video from the patrol car of North Charleston's Michael Slager shows an initial traffic stop and early interactions between the officer and Scott.
Scott family attorney Chris Stewart told CNN the man with Scott was a co-worker and friend.
"This dash cam footage does not change the fact that at the moment the officer shot and killed Mr. Scott -- that shooting was completely unjustified.
In the police report that CNN obtained, a responding officer said that Slager said that at one point he started to chase Scott down a street.
He had control of Scott," Santana said.
or 'What did I do?'
" she said.
The video shows Slager shooting eight times at Scott as Scott runs away.
It's unknown whether Scott took the officer's Taser or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body.
"He has his family, and Mr. Scott also has his family," he told Holt.
"I have watched the video, and I was sickened by what I saw," North Charleston police Chief Eddie Driggers told reporters Wednesday.
Summey said that the city has ordered an additional 150 body cameras "so every officer on the street" in the city will have one.
An autopsy of Scott showed that he "sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body," and his death was the result of a homicide, the Charleston County Coroner's Office said.
"There was not a struggle for the Taser," Anthony Scott said.
"He cared about his family and ... no matter what happens, it will not replace my son."
