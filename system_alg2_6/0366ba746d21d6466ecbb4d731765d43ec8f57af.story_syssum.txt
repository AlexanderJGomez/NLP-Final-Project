Gwenyth Jackaway started to wonder if Donor-X passed on a genetic component to her son, Dylan, who is autistic.
What she couldn't know then is that her son would have autism.
Researchers have found some genetic areas associated with autism, but it could take years before the gene or genes that cause autism or contribute to it will be determined.
"We wouldn't be able to screen a donor for autism because we don't yet know the specific genes that are contributing to autism," Dawson said.
Jackaway says she had to accept that "I don't have that child I thought I was going to have.
Two years ago, she visited Theresa Pergola in the New York area; she had given birth to triplets using sperm from Donor X.
She says Jackaway reassured her that wouldn't be the case.
In six families Jackaway contacted that had used Donor X, three of the children are autistic, and one is showing signs of autism.
There is currently no way to screen for autism, and in a statement, the company said in part:
"On the other hand it's like, what else are they going to screen for, you know?
It's hard to say.
