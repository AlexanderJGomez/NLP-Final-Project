The Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said hundreds of their party members had been taken into custody.
"It is not politically motivated," he said.
The two women who head the parties -- Sheikh Hasina of the Awami League and Khaleda Zia of the BNP -- are in police custody on corruption-related charges.
Begum is an honorific given to women of rank in the country.
Hasina accused Zia of stocking it with BNP backers.
Among those arrested were more than 150 top politicians, including Hasina and Zia -- leading to the current political stalemate.
"The government is conducting political dialogue with small parties.
A similar release for Zia was also expected.
"That actually makes the arrests suspicious in some people's minds," said Sultana Kamal, executive director of the legal aid group, Ain o Salish Kendro (Law and Adjudication Center).
