(CNN) -- Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, who is overseeing the federal response to the BP oil spill, said Sunday that he is "satisfied" with the amount of dispersants that have been used to clean up the disaster, saying crews have used them only when needed.
"I'm satisfied that we only use them [dispersants] when they're needed," he said.
BP issued a statement Sunday saying it has worked closely with the EPA and the Coast Guard over the use of dispersants "since the very beginning" of the disaster.
BP's use of disperants peaked at 70,000 gallons on May 24, the EPA said.
On other occasions, BP used more than the amount approved by the Coast Guard, Markey said in his letter.
Suttles said that the more likely start for the static kill will be Tuesday.
That will be followed by a final "bottom kill" after a relief well intercepts the crippled well -- a step that Allen estimated Sunday to begin a minimum of five to seven days after the static kill is complete.
