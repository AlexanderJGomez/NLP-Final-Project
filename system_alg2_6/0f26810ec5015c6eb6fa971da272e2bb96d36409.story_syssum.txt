The case, brought by Palestinian relatives of some of the deceased, names former Israeli Defense Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer and six other Israeli top military commanders and security officials at the time.
Some of their relatives brought the suit to the court last August.
The court said it will notify Israel to request that those named in the complaint be formally notified, so that they could called by the Spanish court to testify.
