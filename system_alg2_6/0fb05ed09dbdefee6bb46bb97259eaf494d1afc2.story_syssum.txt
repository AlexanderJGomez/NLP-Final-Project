Tarmac Aerosave has been dismantling disused aircraft at its base in "Aerospace Valley" -- a cluster of French flight engineering firms near the town of Tarbes in southern France -- since it was formed in 2009.
All parts that are saved can be sold on by the aircraft owners.
As it stands, Tarmac's site in southern France can cater for 20 aircraft at a time, the company says.
It will also ensure aircraft are disposed of in a way that is efficient and makes the most of valuable materials.
