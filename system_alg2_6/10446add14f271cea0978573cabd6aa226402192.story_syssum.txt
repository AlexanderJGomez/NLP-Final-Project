One of the company's mega-yachts, Katania -- a 100 foot vessel which  Hollywood actress Hilary Swank once chartered, now costs less than $3000 per day.
According to the company, Swank said of her charter holiday: "We had an absolutely enchanted time aboard the Katania.
Tim Wiltshire, director and sales broker at international yacht company Burgess Yachts, said the charter market wasn't a complete disaster, so he was surprised to see such a discount.
He felt that other larger vessels still warranted their greater price tags.
