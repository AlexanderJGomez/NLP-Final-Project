But while Abbas's raising of the document during his speech drew applause at the General Assembly, the United States has already promised it will veto the Palestinian statehood bid at a Security Council meeting Monday.
Both the U.S. and Israel consider the Palestinian strategy a unilateral move that will only hinder the possibility of reaching a peaceful settlement to the Middle East conflict.
Many believe recognition of a Palestinian state would exacerbate already poor relations between the Palestinian Authority government and Israel.
Palestinian Authority leadership maintains that recognition would help put pressure on Israel to be more reasonable in future negotiations.
Venues like these could serve as a place for Palestinians to file legal challenges to Israeli practices and exert more international pressure on Israel.
In an effort to head off the Palestinian's statehood request at the U.N. the United States and various European countries have been engaged in 11th hour diplomacy to get the talks restarted but few expect a breakthrough deal.
