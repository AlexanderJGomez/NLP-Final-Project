Beijing (CNN) -- Vladimir Putin is seeking China's support in Russia's standoff with Western powers over Ukraine.
To be sure, there is no love lost between China and Russia.
China also considers Russia to be a necessary bulwark against the U.S. and European Union influence around the world, often standing with Moscow on matters at the United Nations.
China has supported Russia in its sphere of influence, such as in the Syrian crisis, expecting that Russia would support China's interests in Asia, on issues such as North Korea.
"China does not want to take a position that will haunt it domestically," said a Chinese analyst who declined to be identified because he is not authorized to speak on the record on the topic.
China is also Ukraine's military industry's largest customer; China bought its first aircraft carrier from Ukraine."
