NEW YORK (CNN) -- Early last month, beautiful 25-year-old Laura Garza went missing.
Security video shows Garza leaving the club with convicted sex offender Michael Mele, according to the New York Police Department.
Mele is in jail for violating probation and is a suspect, but he has not been charged in Garza's disappearance, according to state police.
Laura Garza may have been unaware who she was with that night, but the legal system certainly knew him.
In a sane world, Mele is not a free man on that night, able to allegedly target Laura Garza.
Sex offenders start off by nabbing the easy prey -- committing the so-called "minor" sexual offenses like flashing random women, or the crimes Michael Mele committed.
In the same Justice Department study, on average, the sex offenders served less than half of their sentences.
The simple answer is to take all sex offenders off the streets, from the moment they commit the first "minor" offense.
I see it.
