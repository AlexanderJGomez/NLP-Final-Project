Bill Gates and scientists have applied for patents aimed at reducing the strength of oncoming hurricanes.
Hurricanes are fueled by warm water, and cooling the waters surrounding a storm would slow a storm's momentum.
It's very difficult to bring up enough cold water in two to three days to have much effect."
Even if the technology does work, Gray said it won't completely halt a hurricane.
"You're doing something to the ocean that the hurricane would have done anyway," Emanuel said.
A spokeswoman for Intellectual Ventures, which holds about 27,000 technology patents, didn't elaborate on the cost associated with the patent.
"This type of technology is not something humankind would use as a 'Plan A' or 'Plan B,'" Paul "Pablos" Holman, an inventor in the Intellectual Ventures laboratory, wrote on the company blog.
"I would love to see Bill Gates, with all his money, use some of it to experiment."
