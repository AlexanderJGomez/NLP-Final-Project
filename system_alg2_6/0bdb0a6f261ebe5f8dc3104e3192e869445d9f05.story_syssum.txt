(CNN) -- Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf came to power in a bloodless military coup in 1999 when he was chief of Pakistan's army.
But despite early family life in civil service, Musharraf decided on a different career path -- in 1964 he was commissioned second lieutenant in an artillery regiment in the Pakistani Army.
In 2001 Musharraf appointed himself president of Pakistan while remaining the head of the army.
He brought women into the parliament," said Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, director of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency.
In October of that year, Musharraf was re-elected president by a parliament critics said was stacked with his supporters.
He allowed Sharif, the prime minister he deposed, to return from exile.
In February 2008 Musharraf's party admitted defeat in parliamentary elections and he was succeeded by Asif Zardari, Bhutto's widower.
But a Pakistani court later issued an arrest warrant for him in connection to the assassination of Bhutto.
Chaudhry Zulfiqar Ali, a special public prosecutor in the assassination case, said a Rawalpindi court has already issued an arrest warrant for Musharraf.
Musharraf said that he will return even at the risk of his life.
