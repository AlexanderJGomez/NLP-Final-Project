Flash floods from torrential rains over the past three days have killed 15 people and displaced more than 20,000 others in Pakistan's Balochistan province, Abdul Katif Kakar, the director of planning for the Provincial Disaster Management Authority, said Monday.
Kakar says the Pakistan army is helping people affected by the floods.
Flood waters are receding in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, where eight people were reported killed.
