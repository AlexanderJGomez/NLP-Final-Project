MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- A grand jury Tuesday indicted four suspects on charges of first degree felony murder and armed burglary in the slaying of Washington Redskins star Sean Taylor.
Taylor, 24, died a day after he was shot during an apparent burglary at his home.
Taylor got up and locked the bedroom door, but the door was kicked in and two shots were fired, police said.
Authorities have said Garcia told police she was hiding under the bedding during the attack, did not see what happened and could not provide a suspect description.
