Singer Michael Jackson struggled with insomnia, a nutritionist who worked for him told CNN.
Some doctors prescribe antidepressants because their patients have both depression and insomnia.
But the Food and Drug Administration has not officially approved antidepressants for insomnia.
Sleep experts say some antidepressants can help a person sleep, but their sedating effects can wane over time.
Sleep drugs work by slowing activity in the brain to allow sleep.
The use of antidepressants to battle insomnia could be influenced by cost, since generic antidepressants cost less than brand-name insomnia drugs, doctors said.
A sample of 3,400 physicians' prescription practices published in the journal Sleep in 2004 showed that antidepressants were approximately 1.53 times more likely to be prescribed by American doctors than insomnia drugs.
"There are still a lot of doctors prescribing antidepressants and other sedating medicine for insomnia even though those medicines haven't been studied very well for treatment of insomnia and have some different types of risks," Walsh said.
Using anesthetics to get relief from sleep disorders is highly unusual and inappropriate, several doctors have told CNN.
Doctors say that if Jackson was being anesthetized to battle insomnia, it was a dangerous practice.
