Four decades before anyone took an arrow to the knee in "Skyrim," adventurers were sitting down with paper and pencil to battle fantasy monsters and explore rich, new worlds in a different kind of role-playing game.
"In today's culture, D&D has found its place as a leader and influencer over storytellers across so many different mediums," said Nathan Stewart, brand director for D&D at Wizards of the Coast, the company publishing the game.
Honestly, I think she would have preferred the drugs."
Video game creator Ken Levine didn't have friends to play D&D with when he discovered the game in 1978.
By 1981, the game had more than 3 million players worldwide.
"Often times when people think of D&D, they think of the dice, maps and groups of friends sitting around the kitchen table," Stewart said.
"As far as it being an influence on videogames, that's not even a conversation," Holkins said.
"Dungeons & Dragons" sessions are social, Levine said.
From the original rules in 1974 to "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" in 1981 up to "D&D 4th Edition" released in 2008, the idea has always been to give players a framework to create adventures the way they want to experience and enjoy them.
In addition to new rules, the creative team at Wizards of the Coast announced an original storyline that will extend beyond the tabletop and into digital gaming.
"We're aiming to tell the story not only in the role-playing game, but in other venues so that people can experience it at a number of different levels to a number of different depths," Perkins said.
Players will have a shared story, but what actually happens during a tabletop game will be different than in the digital games.
"Let's get a group of friends together and have an adventure," Levine said.
