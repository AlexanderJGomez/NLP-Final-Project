(CNN)The election of a new anti-austerity government in Greece is raising questions about how the debt-laden state will satisfy its creditors and citizens weary of cost-cutting measures.
"We are regaining our lost dignity.
European Central Bank Executive Board member Benoît Cœuré told CNN on Monday that Greece  would still have to pay its debt.
Greece has made remarkable progress in recent years, and we stand ready to continue to assist Greece in addressing the remaining reform challenges," he said.
"Our victory is, at the same time, it's a victory for all the people of Europe that are fighting against austerity that's ruining the common European future," he said.
But it's unclear how Syriza's plans to renegotiate the bailout would play out.
