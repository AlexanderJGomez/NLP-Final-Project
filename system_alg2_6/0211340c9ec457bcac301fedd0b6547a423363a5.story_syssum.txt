Madrid (CNN) -- Spanish rail chiefs testified on safety before lawmakers Thursday, two weeks after 79 people died and scores were injured in a horrific derailment in northwestern Spain.
After the accident, a temporary speed limit of 30 kph was imposed on the stretch where the accident occurred and is still in place, Ferre said.
Gomez-Pomar said Renfe has started to examine the safety systems in place and admitted that they can be improved.
"It has been said that the only cause is the human factor.
If it is really so, we are lost.
Minutes before the derailment, Garzon received a call on his work phone, apparently receiving instructions on the way to Ferrol from a Renfe staff member, a court in Galicia said last month.
