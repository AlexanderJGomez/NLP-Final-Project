(CNN) -- Rizana Nafeek was a child herself -- 17 years old, according to her birth certificate -- when a four-month-old baby died in her care in Saudi Arabia.
Her sentence violated international law, which prohibits the death penalty for crimes committed before age 18.
Conditions for migrant domestic workers in Saudi Arabia are among some of the worst, but domestic workers in other countries rarely enjoy the same rights as other workers.
Many governments have finally begun to recognize the risks and exploitation domestic workers face.
Thailand, and Singapore approved measures to give domestic workers a weekly day off, while Venezuela and the Philippines adopted broad laws for domestic workers ensuring a minimum wage, paid holidays, and limits to their working hours.
Many reforms are needed to prevent another tragic case like that of Rizana Nafeek.
