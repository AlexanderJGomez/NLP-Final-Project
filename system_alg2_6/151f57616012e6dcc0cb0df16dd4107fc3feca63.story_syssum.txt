The University of Kentucky's solar car races along the road, on its way to the finish line.
Fifteen teams of students drove photovoltaic-powered cars across the North American Solar Challenge finish line in Calgary Tuesday, led by the University of Michigan Solar Car Team and its vehicle, Continuum.
Bochum's car took about two hours more, but the University of Waterloo Midnight Sun Solar Car Team was a very close fourth, taking about fifteen minutes longer.
"We got to get out and walk across the finish line with (the car).
But that 20-minute stop was the only time it had to pull over to make repairs, which team members said was one reason they did so well.
He noted that Michigan uses gallium arsenide multi-junction photovoltaic cells on their car.
"We do limit the surface area of the gallium cells," Eberle said, but added, "the people who came in first are the people with the high-performance cells."
Darshni Pillay, operations manager for the University of Calgary Solar Car Team, disagreed about the advantage provided by the gallium cells.
Pillay pointed out that this year was only the second NASC her team has competed in, and said sixth is a big step up from their last finish.
Martz said the car had mechanical problems when it first arrived in Texas and so the team only got it on the track on the second day of a two-day qualifying process.
Pillay added one caveat.
