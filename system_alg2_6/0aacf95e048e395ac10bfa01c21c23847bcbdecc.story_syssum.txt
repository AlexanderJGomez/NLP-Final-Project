"This was my 59-year-old brother," Haskell said of the revelation in a phone interview.
Haskell recently spoke to CNN about her own familial and emotional journey with her transgender sibling.
My brother would have never hurt anyone, so it really told me how powerful the feeling was.
The one thing is that we are born male or female, and we need those boundaries to rub up against.
I do believe there is such a thing as a male and a female; we need these dichotomies, like good and evil.
I think it's more unnerving to people when the person does just seem so normal, but I do think we have to remember that it's not that many people.
You can take hormones to change this, have surgery to change that, but you can't change the voice, the hair, the love -- there is a core of self that doesn't change.
Haskell: I think the reason she didn't go through with it before is because there was no acceptance.
Haskell: The first time we went out in public, I was very self-conscious and nervous.
When she gets on the phone, I would see her as Chevey, my brother.
Why?
I think of it as a partnership.
