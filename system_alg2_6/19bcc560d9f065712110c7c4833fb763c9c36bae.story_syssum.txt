Kids in Africa start kicking a ball when they are six or seven years old, if not younger.
Most kids in Africa don't start playing basketball until they are 13 or 14 years old.
Every year, we conduct the Giants of Africa camp, sponsored by NestlÃ© Milo and Nike, as well as the NBA Basketball Without Borders Africa elite camp.

I know how much talent there is.
It is going to be prominent in tapping basketball talent.
