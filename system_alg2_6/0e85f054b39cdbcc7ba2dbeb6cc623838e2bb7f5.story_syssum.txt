London (CNN) -- Barclays bank took out large UK newspaper ads Saturday to say sorry to "all Barclays customers and clients" in the wake of a rate-rigging scandal which has hammered its reputation.
Barclays was fined $450 million by British and American regulators last month after admitted some of its trading desks purposely under-reported its interest rates.
During the credit crisis of 2007 and 2008, Barclays' high Libor postings came under scrutiny and the bank, concerned about "unfounded negative perceptions," lowered its Libor submissions, according to Barclays notes to the Treasury Committee.
