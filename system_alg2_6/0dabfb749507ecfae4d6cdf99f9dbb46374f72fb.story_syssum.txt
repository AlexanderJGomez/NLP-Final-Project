The reward offer comes as police and federal agents petition neighborhood residents for information in their joint investigation of the three killings and three other attacks on women in the Kensington area of Philadelphia.
Analysis showed the three were killed by the same assailant, Clark said.
The victims all were choked, police said.
Police said a third assault victim was pulled into an alley earlier this month.
All victims were white females involved in prostitution and narcotics, police said.
