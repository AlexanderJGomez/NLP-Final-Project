Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thailand's military announced Thursday that it has taken control of the government.
Tourist attractions, government offices, embassies, shops, restaurants and malls are still open, though some have adjusted their hours in line with the curfew.
All popular tourist destinations outside of Bangkok, including Phuket, Chiang Mai and Krabi, are all operating as normal and there is a limited military presence on the streets, according to reports, though popular night spots closed early on Thursday night due to the curfew.
Tourists are advised to check with their governments before traveling to Thailand, as warnings vary and can impact the validity of their travel insurance.
"Residents intending to visit Thailand should adjust their travel plans and avoid non-essential travel, including leisure travel," says the statement.
