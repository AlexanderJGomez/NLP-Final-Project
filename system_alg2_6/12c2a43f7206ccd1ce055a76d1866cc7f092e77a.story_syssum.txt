ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Four prominent neurologists say they cannot see how Sen. Pete Domenici can continue his work as a U.S. senator given his diagnosis with frontotemporal lobar degeneration, a type of dementia.
But September tests showed the condition had progressed since a checkup in April, he said.
Dr. Bruce Miller, a neurologist at the University of California-San Francisco, says that of the 500 patients he's treated for FTLD, very few have been able to keep working.
In addition to problems with judgment, FTLD patients have behavior and language issues, because of the areas of the brain that are affected.
"Someone who's usually very adept and in touch with people might suddenly make inappropriate or caustic comments, like they might refer to someone who's overweight as 'fatty,'" Knopman says.
