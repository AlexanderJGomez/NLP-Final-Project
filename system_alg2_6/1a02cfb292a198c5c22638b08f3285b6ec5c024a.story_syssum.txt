Anti-abortion protesters plan demonstrations this weekend outside Dr. LeRoy Carhart's clinic in Bellevue, Nebraska.
Anti-abortion groups, led by Operation Rescue, plan to launch protests outside Carhart's clinic this weekend in Bellevue, just south of Omaha.
"Operation Rescue has said Dr. Carhart is the next target ...," said Katherine Spillar, executive vice president with the Feminist Majority Foundation.
He said he abhorred the killing of Tiller.
He said he was confident his organization would have shut down Tiller this summer through a legal battle.
Carhart has vowed to open an office in Kansas and said he'll keep doing abortions as long as he's healthy.
Carhart was performing an abortion in his clinic when Tiller was killed that Sunday morning.
"I do abortions, and that is what I do," he said.
Mark Gietzen, the driver of a truck for Operation Rescue, beamed with pride ahead of the protests.
"When they're ready to accept our position, then we'll sit down.
