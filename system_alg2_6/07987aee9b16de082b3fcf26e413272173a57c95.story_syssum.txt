In recent years, the focus has been on the very serious challenges the ocean faces and the impact these challenges are already having on our daily lives.
Just take a moment to think about what the ocean does for us on a daily basis: it produces half of the world's oxygen; it provides more than one billion people with their primary source of protein; its natural eco-systems like coral reefs, mangroves and wetlands provide protection against coastal erosion and natural disasters such as tsunamis; it regulates our climate; and a healthy ocean fuels sustainable businesses and a strong economy in industries such as seafood, tourism, pharmaceuticals and shipping.
Big technology like renewable energy, carbon sequestration and advances in aquaculture certainly have a major role in restoring the ocean and the planet to a healthy balance, but in many cases it's a matter of giving nature the space and time to do what it needs to do with a helping hand from all of us.
Take fisheries for example, with two billion people joining us on this planet over the next 40 years, there will be a huge need for more sources of protein.
We can make sure the ocean continues to provide inspiration, wonder and solutions for generations, however, it all comes down to personal and collective will.
