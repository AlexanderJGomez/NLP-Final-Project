LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- A hearing is set for Monday in a case involving actress Lindsay Lohan after an arrest warrant was issued for her Friday, officials said.
Lohan "has the right to appear" at the hearing, said Alan Parachini, Los Angeles Superior Court spokesman.
"Since her case was resolved, Ms. Lohan has been in compliance with all the terms and conditions of her probation and all orders of the court," Holley said in a statement.
A judge sentenced Lohan to three years probation after she entered guilty and no contest pleas to the charges.
Her last album was released in 2005.
