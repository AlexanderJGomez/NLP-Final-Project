(CNN) -- The astounding discovery that our universe apparently is expanding at an accelerating rate some 14 billion years after the Big Bang has earned three scientists the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced Tuesday.
"I am delighted, excited, and deeply honored," Perlmutter said in a written statement.
"The findings of the 2011 Nobel Laureates in Physics have helped to unveil a universe that to a large extent is unknown to science.
Bragg is not only the youngest physics laureate, he is also the youngest laureate in any Nobel prize area.
Since the group's members did not know of Steinman's death when they made the decision, the award will stand, the assembly said.
