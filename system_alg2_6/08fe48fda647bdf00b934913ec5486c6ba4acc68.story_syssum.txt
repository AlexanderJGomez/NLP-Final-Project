Now, these soldiers have a counterpart: female terra-cotta warriors.
The difference is these female terra-cotta warriors are not out to protect any emperor, but were created to bring attention to the plight of girls in China.
And, in a striking parallel to the terra-cotta soldiers, the terra-cotta girls will also become an archaeological project.
She created the first eight statues modeled after eight girls whom she met through an orphan charity in China.
But after we began the project, he changed his view and even turned one of the 108 combinations into a portrait of his own daughter," said Nourry.
Her favorite moment was when the eight girls saw the terra-cotta statues of themselves and were delighted.
And why aren't there more girls in China?
