Meanwhile, De La Cruz took the high road.
"For those that said something bad about me, I understand it's your opinion," Sebastien told CNN.
My father and my mother told me that you should never judge people by how they look.

"To be invited back to sing the national anthem is just amazing because now I know the San Antonio Spurs like how I sing," Sebastien said.
