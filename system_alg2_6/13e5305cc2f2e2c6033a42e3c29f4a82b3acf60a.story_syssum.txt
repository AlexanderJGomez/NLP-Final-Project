KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Hundreds of excited music fans wait in line on the lookout for their favorite singers on a hit television show.
Mohseni, who started the country's top television network, Tolo TV, said he's just trying to revive Afghan culture after the fallow Taliban era when music and television were banned.
Afghanistan's guardians of Islamic values, the Ulema Council, protested that "Afghan Star" and Tolo TV's popular Indian soap operas were not part of Afghan culture.
That culture war can be seen on Tolo TV.
Mohseni said that "Afghan Star" pushes his country forward in subtle ways, for instance teaching a few valuable lessons in democracy.
Either way, Tolo TV has an avid audience: According to Mohseni, the finals of both "Afghan Star" and "Koran Star" won their nights' ratings races, easily beating the competition.
