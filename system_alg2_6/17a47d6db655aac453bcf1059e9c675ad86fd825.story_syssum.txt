(CNN) -- Lionel Messi scored twice for Barcelona as the European champions crushed BATE Borisov 5-0 to claim their first Group H win in this season's Champions League.
Milan opened the scoring in the 53rd minute when Zlatan Ibrahimovic marked his return from injury by netting from the penalty spot after Marian Cisovsky handled in the area.
Lars Bender opened the scoring on the half hour mark, slamming home a shot from a tight angle, and veteran midfielder Michael Ballack sealed the win in injury time with a superb volley -- his first goal in more than 18 months.
Arsenal are second in the table with four points, two behind French champions Marseille, who lead the way with a maximum six points after cruising to a 3-0 home win over Borussia Dortmund.
That result leaves APOEL on four points, with Zenit and Porto on three apiece and Shakhtar trailing on a single point.
