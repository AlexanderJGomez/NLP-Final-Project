In an eerily similar incident in May 2004, former Springbok rugby player Rudi Visagie was awoken by his wife, who heard a car in their driveway in Nelspruit, South Africa.
"I wondered what's happening now ... and he told me it's Marle in the car."
"It happened that one shot out of a million ... went right through the door and penetrated my daughter through the neck," Visagie said.
The track star has said he thought an intruder was hiding in a toilet room inside the bathroom of his Pretoria home.
Pistorius left jail last week after posting a cash bond of about $11,200, with an additional $100,800 due by March 1.
The former rugby player said he sympathizes with the sprinter.
"I just want to encourage him (Pistorius) and say listen, there are a lot of people praying for you," he said.
