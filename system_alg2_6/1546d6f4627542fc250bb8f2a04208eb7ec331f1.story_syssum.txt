New York (CNN) -- A day after saying homosexuality is not "an equally valid or successful option," New York gubernatorial candidate Carl Paladino denied being anti-gay Monday but said it was "disgusting" that his opponent took his children to a gay pride parade.
Paladino defended that remark Monday, telling both "Today" and ABC's "Good Morning America" that he was referring to the difficult path homosexuals face because of discrimination.
Asked whether he believes homosexuality is a choice, Paladino said, "I've had difficulty with that.
Paladino emphasized in a statement Sunday night that he did not include those lines when he delivered his remarks, and said Monday he had crossed them out from his prepared remarks.
Paladino at first suggested to "Today" that the lines were written by members of the Jewish group he was speaking to, although he later said he wasn't sure whether they originated with a group member or one of his staff.
I don't think they should be married," he told CNN.
"I just think my children and your children would be much better off and much more successful getting married and raising a family," he said.
Paladino also criticized Cuomo for marching in New York's gay pride parade in June.
New York "celebrates our diversity" with festivities such as the Columbus Day parade and the gay rights parade, he said.
"I think gay men and women -- my neighbors and your neighbors -- would be much better off and much more successful if they were allowed equal rights and the option of getting married and raising a family.
It isn't."
"Watch," Paladino said before walking off.
