"Planet in Peril" met in a secret location with members of the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta.
The other is the Nigerian government.
Nigeria's federal government and oil companies split oil profits roughly 60-40.
"The work being done by the corruption agency and the federal government has somehow been able to control the level of corruption in government."
Over the years, MEND's attacks on oil pipelines have halted oil production and, therefore, raised the price of oil around the world.
They demand oil profits be distributed to average Nigerians of the Niger Delta and said they will not stop their attacks until their objectives have been fulfilled.
Yet, there is no international outcry and rarely are the spills reported, even to most Nigerians.
It took the oil company three months to clamp the leak, but the company said it wasn't reported for a full month after it began.
Who knows?
