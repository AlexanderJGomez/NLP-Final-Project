Earlier, county spokesman Dave Rose told CNN that the Black Forest Fire, burning northeast of the city, now appears to be the most destructive in terms of property lost in state history.
The fire's evacuation area was 93,000 acres, affecting approximately 38,000 people and 13,000 homes, and the flames were estimated to have burned through 15,700 acres, said Maketa.
"We literally had five minutes, and we left because it was, the flames were there," Jaenette Coyne told CNN's AC360 Thursday night.
But we know it was.
A lot of people here just don't know," Jaenette Coyne said.
Paula Warren, one of thousands of residents forced to flee her home northeast of Colorado Springs, spoke about how difficult it was to leave and wonder if her home was all right.
Warren didn't know exactly where the friend had seen the information but she believed it to be true.
"You can't just take 'em to a Motel 6," she said.
So many people have suffered loss, and so we're just thankful that we're here and safe and that we're loved, and that we have so many people that are willing to help take care of us," she said.
Maketa said Thursday that 360 homes had been destroyed; another 14 were damaged.
Another major fire in the state is the Royal Gorge Fire, which is burning 55 miles to the southwest, on the other side of Colorado Springs.
It burned several buildings around the iconic Royal Gorge Suspension Bridge, and threatened the bridge itself.
