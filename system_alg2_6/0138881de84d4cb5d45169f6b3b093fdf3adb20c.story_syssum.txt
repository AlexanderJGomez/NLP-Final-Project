Matt Sandusky told the grand jury nothing inappropriate had ever happened to him.
In the police interview, Matt Sandusky said that he was molested between the ages of 8 and 15, that he tried to escape from the Sandusky home and once attempted suicide.
It was only days before the commonwealth rested, and after some alleged victims had testified, according to Matt Sandusky's lawyers, that he told them he was abused and wanted to cooperate with prosecutors.
By not putting Jerry Sandusky on the stand, the defense ensured that Matt Sandusky would not testify.
The audiotape's leak was the main subject of a meeting hastily called Tuesday by trial Judge John Cleland and attended by prosecutors, defense attorneys and even the judge who has overseen the grand jury that's investigated the Sandusky case, a source with knowledge of the meeting told CNN National Correspondent Susan Candiotti.
"I'm innocent," said Jerry Sandusky, in answer to questions CNN's Candiotti asked of him through his lawyer.
"I didn't do it," he said, according to Rominger.
