I say mysterious because the business of yacht building is full of rumors and speculation until the ship is seen leaving the sheds of the family-owned builders, whether in Amsterdam, Hamburg or Bremen.
Aly said the bigger yacht side of the business is coming back faster than the smaller side.
"Maybe we will see 200 meters, but I think that's it," said Aly.
We could ask one of the owners, but they tend to like the yacht to do the talking.
And they have his.
And de Vries has something new and special coming out of the shed soon.
It's about the personal touch, as Lurssen stressed.
At a time that Europe is very worried about jobs, the uptick in interest for mega yachts should be looked at in a positive light, even if news reports will soon be filled with gossip (and jealousy?)
