Through the gap, I could pick out Mohammed Al-Zaneen tip-toeing through the debris of his three-story home in Gaza's Beit Hanoun neighborhood.
He gently plucked a framed photo from a wall.

My eyes follow him as he walks away, almost begging him to speak.
But his message is clear to me: He has no room for the rubbish of this war.
