LONDON, England (CNN) -- An American professor doing research in London stumbled across a series of previously unknown letters written by, to, and about Benjamin Franklin, a stunning find that sheds new light on early U.S. history.
Houston, a professor at the University of California at San Diego, discovered the letters on the last day of his last research trip to London, just before the library's closing time.
The letters cover Franklin's success in dealing with British Gen. Edward Braddock, who had been sent to Pennsylvania in 1755 to defeat the French at Fort Duquesne, in modern-day Pittsburgh.
Franklin went all over Pennsylvania trying to persuade farmers to lend their horses and wagons to Braddock and his men.
Houston said he believes the documents he read at the British Library are copies of that collection.
Birch's transcripts were filed in the British Library as "Copies of Letters relating to the March of General Braddock."
"We're very pleased."
