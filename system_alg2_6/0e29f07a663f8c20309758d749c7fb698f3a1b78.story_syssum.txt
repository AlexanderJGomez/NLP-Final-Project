(CNN) -- A heavy police presence in Bahrain on Sunday limited marches by protesters organized to coincide with the controversial Formula One race in the kingdom, won by world champion Sebastian Vettel.
Maj. Gen. Tariq Hassan Al-Hassan, Bahrain's public security chief, said meticulous planning had gone into the event, the official Bahrain News Agency reported Saturday.
Last year, opposition calls for large protests raised fears that the Bahrain Grand Prix would have to be canceled for a second year running and pose a threat to car crews, workers and fans.
Despite fresh protests in the run-up to this year's event, the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile, the sport's regulator, and Formula One Management, the commercial rights holders for the sport, insisted the race would take place as planned.
Security forces only respond when "protests encouraged by extreme opposition groups result in deliberate and targeted violence," it said, and they use appropriate restraint.
Formula One racing is the world's most popular motor sport, and races have a TV audience of more than 500 million, though the scenes last year in Bahrain were viewed as a public relations disaster for both the sport and the country's authorities.
