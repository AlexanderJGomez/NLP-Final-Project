Za'atari refugee camp, Jordan (CNN) -- I've spent the past week working in the Za'atari refugee camp in northern Jordan, about six miles from the Syrian border.
Yesterday, I met many newly-arrived refugees, some just children, who told me how had they witnessed family members and neighbors being killed in Syria.
More tents, improved water systems, more safe spaces and playgrounds for children and psycho-social counseling for children who have been traumatized are all top priorities.
Wasfeyah, a refugee mother of five children, told me that when her family was trying to escape to Jordan, they were shot at and her eldest son, Ali, was hit in the head by a bullet.
More playgrounds and child-friendly spaces are being planned as the camp population grows.
Many days it is hard to see more than a few meters in front of you in the camp, as the air is thick with sand and debris that is carried by the strong winds that blow through the barren camp.
Water is currently being trucked into the camps from local wells in the community, but Mercy Corps will be drilling a new well and developing a water system with other organizations that will serve the camp, and alleviate the need to take scarce water from the host community.
No one knows how long the camp will be here and when the Syrian refugees will be able to go home.
