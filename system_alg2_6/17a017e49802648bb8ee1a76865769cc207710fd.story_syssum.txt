The network is now negotiating with Leno and its current late-night hosts, Conan O'Brien and Jimmy Fallon, to decide who ends up with which time slot, Gaspin said.
Gaspin said the plan now is for Leno to host a new, half-hour show at 11:35 p.m.
While NBC appeared to be fine with Leno's numbers, the affiliates "kind of revolted and said we have to have better ratings," Levine said.
Moving "Tonight" -- which has held its current slot for decades -- back a half-hour is likely to hurt the show, and Berman predicted that NBC will be unable to keep all three hosts.
