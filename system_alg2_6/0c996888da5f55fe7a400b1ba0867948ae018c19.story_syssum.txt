(CNN) -- Manny Pacquiao's career will be defined by Floyd Mayweather, even if the Filipino can't give boxing the fight it has long been clamoring to see.
I'm as optimistic as I have been in long time for that fight to come off late in the year, maybe December.
Pacquiao, who is a congressman in the Philippines, is due to announce who his next opponent will be at his 32nd birthday celebrations on Friday with Shane Mosley, Juan Manuel Marquez and Andre Berto in the frame.
He recently moved his next fight from April to May due to his political responsibilities in the country.
