After dating for more than two years, Ferguson and his boyfriend, Justin Mikita, decided to take the next step.
CNN: When you go to www.tietheknot.org, the first thing you see is a hilarious video of you and Justin announcing your engagement.
Ferguson: We kind of felt like the only way to legitimize why we wanted to do this was to announce that we were actually engaged.
Ferguson: I hate "lover"!
CNN: A lot of boyfriends, and girlfriends in Maine, Maryland and Washington got some good news on Election Day when same-sex marriage was legalized in those states by popular vote.
I just feel like it shouldn't be up to the majority to vote on a minority's civil rights.
We just want to add to who has the right.
They weren't going to change the meaning of going to the polls and putting the card in the ballot; they just wanted the right to vote.
Then Justin came up with the idea of Tie the Knot, which just perfectly marries those two ideas.
Ferguson: I mean it really is.
I've gotten engaged since meeting these people.
We're always checking in with one another, and some walls definitely go up to protect some people.
CNN: I can only imagine what a "Modern Family" gay wedding will be like.
I'm also really excited to be married.
I haven't been to the Catholic Church in years so I would feel really weird to try and bring in those traditions -- it's just not us.
And we both do.
But, yeah, we both really want kids very much.
