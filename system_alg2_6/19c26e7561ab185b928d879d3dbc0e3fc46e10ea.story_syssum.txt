NEW YORK (CNN) -- Russia invades Georgia and President Bush goes on vacation.
It occurs to me that John McCain is as intellectually shallow as our current president.
When asked what his Christian faith means to him, his answer was a one-liner.
Why not?
That was it.
?
Unless he's reciting talking points or reading from notes or a TelePrompTer, John McCain is lost.
George Bush's record as a student, military man, businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure.
I fear to the depth of my being that John McCain is just like him.
