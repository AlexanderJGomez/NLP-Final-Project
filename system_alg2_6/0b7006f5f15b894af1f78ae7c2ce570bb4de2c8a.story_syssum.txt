Yanukovych issued a defiant statement to Russian news agencies condemning the interim government in Kiev and calling everything happening now in the Ukrainian parliament illegitimate, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported Thursday.
Pro-Russian members of the Crimean parliament dismissed the government of Crimean Premier Anatolii Mohyliov in a vote of no confidence Thursday, his spokesman Andrey Demartino told CNN.
Crimea was handed to Ukraine by the Soviet Union in 1954.
"The key task for the Ukrainian government is European integration," he said.
The future of Ukraine is in Europe, and Ukraine will become a member of the European Union."
U.S. officials earlier told CNN that the Russian military exercises were making U.S. military and intelligence agencies concerned that Russia may be positioning ground forces to be able to move across the border into Ukraine if Moscow issued such orders.
Mohyliov, the Crimean Prime Minister, told CNN earlier Thursday that the gunmen had refused to speak with him, telling him he had no authority.
The men, who stormed the building early Thursday, had made no demands, and it was not clear what they wanted, he said.
We only saw the building being taken over," he said.
