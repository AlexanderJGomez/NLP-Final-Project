The real estate developer and art lover donated $40 million, half made up from his private art collection, to the Pérez Art Museum Miami, known as PAMM, one of the few major institutions in the United States with a Hispanic name.
Jorge Pérez hopes his museum will help take Miami to the next level.
Now, 110 works selected by the museum from Pérez's private collection are available for everyone to see inside the three-story, 200,000-square-foot museum, designed by the Pritzker Prize-winning Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron.
While the majority of board members voted in favor of naming the museum after Pérez, four resigned in protest.
Some of the board members argued the name of the museum should represent the city's central art museum.
It seemed odd that PAMM received its share of strife for naming it after donor when just a few years ago the Miami Science Museum's name was changed to the Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum of Science after a generous donor who gave $35 million to construct the new museum in Museum Park.
"Jorge Pérez is the first major donor from the Hispanic community," Thomas said.
