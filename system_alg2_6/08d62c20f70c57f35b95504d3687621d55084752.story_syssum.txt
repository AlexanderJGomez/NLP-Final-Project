(CNN) -- China's 700 million smartphone users will no longer be able to share stories about politics without official approval, according to new regulations announced by authorities on Thursday, which took immediate effect.
Prominent Weibo users were later detained or prosecuted, on charges both related and unrelated to their online activities.
"It's quite obvious now, other public accounts are definitely going to be more cautious about republishing political news because no one knows how strongly the rules will be enforced.
The three-year-old WeChat, owned by Tencent holdings, is unlike any other mobile app.
We welcome users to report such instance to us via online channel."
Danwei's Goldkorn doesn't feel that increased government regulation will have any lasting impact on innovation.
