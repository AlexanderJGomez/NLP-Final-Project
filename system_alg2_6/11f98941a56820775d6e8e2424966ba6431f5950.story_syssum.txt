Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- Just taking a sip of water or walking to the bathroom is excruciatingly painful for 15-year-old Michael Brewer, who was burned over 65 percent of his body after being set on fire, allegedly by a group of teenagers.
The teen faces a lifelong recovery from his injuries, Schulman told CNN's Harris.
Physical therapy, she said, is "incredibly painful.
"He focuses on Ozzy, and he gets through his torture hour."
Difficult for us to listen to," she said of the interview.
Bent allegedly encouraged the attack, police said.
He has not been interviewed by police or prosecutors, Schneider said.
We don't need any negative energy coming into the recovery so we just stay away from it, period.
Her son's recovery has been filled with ups and downs, she said.
