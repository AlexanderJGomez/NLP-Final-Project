Why?
Either way, South Carolina Republicans will most likely continue their tradition of picking the candidate who turns out to be the GOP nominee, something they have done since 1980.
Yes, Christian conservatives dominate the GOP here, but victory in South Carolina means you have successfully appealed to a wide variety of Republican concerns.
But I would be lying if I said the majority of South Carolina GOP voters are strongly anti-government.
Yes, social issues matter a lot to voters.
Consider that this past week, BMW announced a new $900 million investment that is expected to bring 300 new jobs, for starters, to Spartanburg in the Upstate.
This will be more difficult with Perry and Gingrich still in the race, splitting the evangelical vote.
And once again, South Carolina will have done her job.
