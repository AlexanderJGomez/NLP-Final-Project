Washington (CNN) -- Iran said it took "decisive" action after a U.S. drone entered Iranian airspace in the Persian Gulf last week, a commander said.
"Our aircraft was never in Iranian airspace.
Two of the officials said the fighter jets belonged to Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps force, which has been more confrontational than regular Iranian military forces.
Little said the United States has to assume that Iran was trying to bring down the Predator.
"The armed forces will respond decisively to any act of transgression," he said, according to the semi-official Fars News Agency.
