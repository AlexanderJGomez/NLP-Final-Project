Do you own a wrap dress?
Diane Von Furstenberg, or DVF as she's known, sold her first wrap dress in the 1970s.
"It's a very traditional form of clothing, it's a dress that has no buttons and no zipper," said Von Furstenberg.
"My love affair with the DVF wrap dress began in the 1970s," says Anna Boccia Lewis, a self-confessed "DVF addict" from California.
CNN asked other women to tell us what it is about DVF dresses that make them so special.
