Atlanta (CNN) -- On September 1, 2012, an adult inmate was attacked at Baldwin State Prison in Hardwick, Georgia.
Thirty-three prisoners and one officer have been killed by other prisoners in Georgia since 2010, according to a report released Wednesday by the Southern Center for Human Rights in Atlanta.
In February, a prisoner had three fingers severed by a man with a 19-inch knife at Wilcox State Prison in Abbeville, Georgia.
And on, and on and on.
Last year, some 21,000 men and women were released from Georgia prisons, according to the report.
The report highlights three Georgia prisons as particularly dangerous: Baldwin State Prison, Hays State Prison and Smith State Prison.
"The U.S. Department of Justice should launch a thorough investigation," reads the center's report.
