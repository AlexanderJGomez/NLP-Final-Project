Cell phone footage shows the nighttime scene in Tehran, Iran, which was sent to CNN's iReport.
CNN spoke with the man who shot the footage.
A widely circulated video of the young woman shows her apparently in the middle of protests over the weekend with an older man, believed to be her father.
A group of men in black, members of the nation's Basij militia, the iReporter says, appear to gang up on one man and beat him with batons.
There has been no reaction to the violence posted on those sites, but the Iranian government has previously said that it does not approve of street protests.
"More helicopters flying over Tehran today than any previous day" someone from inside Iran tweeted Monday.
