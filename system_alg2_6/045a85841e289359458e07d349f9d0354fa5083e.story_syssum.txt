(CNN) -- Director Oliver Stone was recently a speaker at a JFK assassination conference in Pittsburgh, and he was left wondering why the symposium wasn't getting a lot of love.
"There's nothing in the movie that I would go back on," he said.
If people knew about those loopholes, Stone said, the single-shooter theory and the "magic bullet" theory "fall apart, if anybody in their right mind looks at it," Stone said.
Eyewitnesses who've come forward in recent years also provide evidence that shots came from more than one location or angle.
"My best answer to people who would criticize anything we say in the 'JFK' movie is to look at Chapter Six of 'Untold History,' 'JFK: To the Brink,' to understand the man, and the big picture of events," Stone said.
We didn't make it up."
Because "JFK" was "such a controversial film, Stone said most of the extended Kennedy clan "wanted to stay away from it.
"I think conspiracies go on all the time," Stone said.
They're in our government.
They're your back-door neighbor.'
Although Stone entertained the conspiracy talk with the anniversary and reissues, he did note that the one story about himself that he'd like to see die is the one that makes him out to be the go-to conspiracy guy.
For one thing, the film he had hoped to make but went to someone else was "Evita."
