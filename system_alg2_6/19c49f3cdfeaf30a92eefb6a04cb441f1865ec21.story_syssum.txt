Former President George W. Bush is enjoying another bounce in the post-presidential polls.
With the exception of a few of our leaders, such as Abraham Lincoln of Franklin Roosevelt, people tend to remember presidents in different ways at different times.
Much of the controversy that surrounded Bush had to do with his national security policies.
The ways in which a president's policies unfold over time is also essential.
Presidential reputations also can be shaped, in the relative short term, by what a president does after leaving office.
But when those problems continue long after a president is gone, as has been the case with the economy, the public tends to gain some perspective (even as they attack the existing president) about how the sources of discontent stem from the structural problems with the government and the economy rather than any individual person.
On the one hand, it might give him some solace that even with all the grief he has faced over issues such as health care and sluggish economic growth, it is easy to see how his record could look much stronger to Americans over time.
