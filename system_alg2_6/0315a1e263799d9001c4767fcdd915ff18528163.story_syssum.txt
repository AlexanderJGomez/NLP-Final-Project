Seriously.
Just because a woman is hot does not mean that her life is perfect.
As a woman, I know this to be very true.
Women DO NOT like bad boys.
Women want to be approached, as long as it's by the right person.
Women want you to respect them, not admire them.
Respect yourself first, and women will follow.
