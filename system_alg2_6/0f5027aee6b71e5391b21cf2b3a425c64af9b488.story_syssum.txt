New Zealand Prime Minister John Key restored titular honors in 2009 after they had been abolished by a Labour government in 2000.
There are differences between Australia and New Zealand, however.
New Zealand decided its status within the empire would be grander by staying separate from Australia.
New Zealand Maori play an important part in the country's position on the monarchy.
The Order of New Zealand was introduced by a reformist Labour government in 1987.
Australia differed from New Zealand in holding a referendum on becoming a republic in 1999, despite the prime minister's monarchism and a divided Liberal Party.
The referendum provided for appointment by parliament, when many favored a directly elected president.
As for baby Prince George, support for his position as future heir to the thrones of Australia and New Zealand may be dictated in part by the sustainability of his -- and his parents' -- celebrity status.
