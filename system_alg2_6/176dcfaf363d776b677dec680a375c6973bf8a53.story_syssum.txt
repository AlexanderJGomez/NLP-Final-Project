Aqsa gave a lingering farewell to her bedridden grandmother, and that's when Khalida, her mother, knew something was wrong.
Her father says when he spoke to her about coming home, she said that she would see her family on Judgment Day and would like to be a martyr.
Aqsa is said to be influenced by watching sermons online and coming in contact with people through social media that helped her make the trek from Glasgow to Syria.
They went to the prestigious private school Craigholme down the road.
We just don't know what happened to her.
"She didn't go out much.
We all went together," Muzaffar says.
But she made one mistake, but otherwise, she is really a very good girl.
Her mother says Aqsa never complained despite being asked to help with housework.
Don't worry.
The family hopes and prays that Aqsa will come home.
In a special message to Aqsa through CNN, her parents made a personal appeal to their daughter.
Looking directly into the camera, Khalida said, "Aqsa, my dear daughter, please come back.
I love you, my dear daughter.
Anwar, the lawyer, says Aqsa is not directly responsible for committing any crimes and is safe to return home.
But they say they are still holding hope that one day, she will come back.
