The divers stopped searching months ago because of the winter and water conditions, and the South Korean ferry remains on the bottom of the sea floor.
Park's case is an unsettling one -- emblematic of what remains unresolved a year after the Sewol ferry sank.
On April 16, the Sewol ferry, carrying hundreds of high school students, began sinking after taking a sharp turn.
Anger over how the crew failed to evacuate the passengers intensified when video surfaced of the ferry's captain in his underwear leaping into the arms of the Korean Coast Guard while hundreds remained trapped in the vessel.
Criticism swirled over the South Korean Coast Guard's effectiveness in carrying out the rescue operation.
The captain of the first coast guard ship sent to rescue the Sewol passengers was found guilty of negligence and making false reports.
An inexperienced crew and redesigns of the ship to handle more passengers and cargo were also cited as factors in the disaster.
In the immediate aftermath, South Korean prosecutors arrested the captain, crew members and business associates.
Whether the ferry will be raised and an independent investigation will be held remains to be seen.
