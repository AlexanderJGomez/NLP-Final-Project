And so it is.
That's why so many people descend on the marathon every year, and why so many people found themselves in harm's way.
To complete the celebration, Patriots Day marks the annual 11 a.m. Red Sox game at Fenway Park, an utterly local tradition concocted so baseball crowds wouldn't get in the way of marathon crowds.
These days, it's more of a pure spectacle, and I doubt many of those watching could name even one of the East African runners who have won in recent years.
Sadly, the marathon will not be the same after today.
And we are.
