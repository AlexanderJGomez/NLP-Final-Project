In the dead of night, in the bohemian Los Angeles district of Fairfax, a "guerrilla" street artist is about to start work.
It is a stenciled image of fallen American hero Lance Armstrong.
Now Armstrong has been immortalized in a piece of street art -- named "Are there any heroes anymore?"
"Plastic Jesus," who chose that tag due to his atheism, previously ran a news photography agency in London that dealt with Britain's major newspapers -- hence his experience of covering riots.
"The art is in the message -- it's not about the technical quality of the piece," said the 48-year-old.
has been creating quite a buzz," says Greg Linton, editor-in-chief of the street art blog Melrose and Fairfax.
