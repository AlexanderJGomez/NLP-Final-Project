St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch told CNN affiliate KMOV that his office planned to begin presenting the case to a grand jury Wednesday.
The most high-profile figure in President Barack Obama's administration to visit Ferguson, Holder has stressed that the federal government is on the case and listening -- both to protesters calling for Wilson's arrest and for an end to what they describe as a heavy-handed police response, and to residents and law enforcement officers challenged with looting and violence from some in the crowd.
Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman who has been a protest fixture, thinks installing a special prosecutor would be smart given the African-American community's distrust of the county prosecutor and law enforcement in general.
Assuming McCulloch stays in charge and his grand jury timeline holds, French said that having weeks and weeks go by will only aggravate the situation.
If they're calling for justice, we need justice for everyone."
Ron Johnson, who is in charge of security, later told reporters someone threw urine on police.
Police arrested 47 people, Johnson said, including a car full of people who he said were armed and threatened to shoot an officer.
In his public comments, Holder has urged law enforcement to show restraint and respect people's right to protest, while he has condemned looting and violence by protesters.
