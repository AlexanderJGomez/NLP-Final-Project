(CNN) -- Things are looking horrible for President Barack Obama.
What will happen next: Will our hero prevail like John McClane in "Die Hard," or will he fail like William Wallace in "Braveheart"?
Perhaps the worst thing about the problems with the Obamacare website is that they occurred at a time when things were finally looking politically brighter for Obama.
The rain has stopped, the ocean is turning calm and there is even a glimmer of sunlight; he's beaten the storm.
This may be exciting to watch, but not great for the character, who has no idea what will happen next.
Unseating some tea party House members has become newly possible after the shutdown mess.
Sure, the Republicans will push back -- they will say Obama is behaving like a "king" or "tyrant" and complain about him nightly on Fox News.
Will the President's agenda continue to be dictated by others, making him nothing more than a lame duck, caretaker President?
