(CNN) -- In his September 4 op-ed, Jack Schlossberg presents his case that young Americans should cast their ballots for President Obama this fall.
Or, according to this analysis, that half of recent college graduates are jobless or underemployed Or that under Obama, the national debt has risen $5 trillion.
In a word, travesty.
Obama regards students as beneficiaries of his achievements.
Schlossberg's discussion of Obama's energy policy is equally selective.
But in this case, it's about coming to terms with the fact that Obama has had his chance to lead and his policies have failed.
We can reward truth-telling.
