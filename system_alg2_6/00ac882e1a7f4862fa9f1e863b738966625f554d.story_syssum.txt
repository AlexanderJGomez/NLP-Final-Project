Below are some of the more interesting questions and my answers to them.
Moss: One of the interesting things about the relationship between Jesus and John the Baptist is that John doesn't lay down his tools and follow Jesus after he baptizes him.
Moss: I'm so glad someone brought up DNA.
Thinking back to my time in the laboratory with the Copenhagen scientists, I recall that the lead investigator estimated that the probability was about 75%.
This gives us another -- arguably more historical -- perspective on why John was executed and provides further evidence about just how important John was in his own day.
In the Gospel of Luke, one of Jesus' disciples says, "Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples."
But if you were just reading Luke you could come to that conclusion.
