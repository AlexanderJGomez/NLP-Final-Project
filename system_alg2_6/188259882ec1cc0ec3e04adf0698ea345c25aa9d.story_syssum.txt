The dog brought the skull back home in September and its owner contacted authorities, who have worked since then to determine if the remains were that of fugitive Kevin Patrick Stoeser.
Two months later, staff members allegedly caught Stoeser using a smart phone which had images of underage children, authorities said Monday.
No other remains have been found, they said.
In July, a phone call to authorities came during an airing of "The Hunt" which led them to Charles Mozdir, a suspected sex offender.
