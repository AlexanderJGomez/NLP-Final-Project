(CNN) -- With her glamorous looks and exceptional talent, Nigerian movie star Genevieve Nnaji is one of Africa's most successful actresses.
GN: Nigeria is a unique and a peculiar country, and as the people, we are too.
We do have that bond and I think it has to do with our background and how we are raised....I would never live anywhere else to be honest, no.
GN: You never get completely used to it, like the last time I was here for the other premiere -- "Bursting Out" -- it was pretty overwhelming.
But I can't complain.
Mostly because there is still something inside of me that I just feel I haven't let out and it's really trying to come out and trying to burst loose so I'm hoping for that opportunity...I just want that story, that story that challenges me even further.
