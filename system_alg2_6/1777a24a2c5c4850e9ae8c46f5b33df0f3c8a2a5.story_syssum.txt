Mitt Romney's savaging of Gingrich helped him to clinch Florida.
Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich will compete over who is the most conservative, and Ron Paul will push his unique brand of libertarianism.
So it would serve Santorum well to hit Mitt hard in the debate.
Instead, Romney has been working hard on his own favorability rating in Michigan, which has crept up from 49% to 55%.
But Mitt has been countering the "weirdo factor" with a series of ads and personal appearances in Michigan that emphasize his local roots and his concern for the auto industry in a state beset by tragic levels of unemployment.
But if Romney's reinvention as a human being does pay off, it will be because Republicans desperately want it to work.
A bit of passion and compassion in Wednesday's debate could be all the excuse wavering Republicans need to back a winner.
