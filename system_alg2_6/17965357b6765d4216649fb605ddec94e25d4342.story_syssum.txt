(CNN) -- Malawi said it won't host an African Union summit next month because the organization wants Omar al-Bashir, the Sudanese leader accused of war crimes in Darfur, to attend.
The AU, the organization of countries across the African continent, has said before that its members shouldn't cooperate with al-Bashir's arrest.
the Human Rights Watch said.
"Civil society groups across the African continent have repeatedly urged governments to arrest -- not host -- al-Bashir," said Elise Keppler, senior international justice counsel at Human Rights Watch.
