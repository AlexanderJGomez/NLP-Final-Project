ACORN leader Bertha Lewis defends her group at the National Press Club on Tuesday in Washington.
Similar videos were made at other ACORN offices.

Lewis contends the group also has been responsive to allegations that some canvassers falsified voter registration applications and turned in those who falsified voter registration forms.
Lewis acknowledged that the founder's sibling embezzled nearly $1 million from the group.
Such critics of the group believe "we needed to be stopped," Lewis said.
"Last week, members of Congress were asked, 'Are you now or have you ever been members of ACORN?
