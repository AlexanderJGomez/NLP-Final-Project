(EW.com) -- In the "Incredible Burt Wonderstone," Steve Carell and Steve Buscemi play world-famous Las Vegas magicians.
One night, the two are working with a brand-new assistant, Jane (Olivia Wilde), performing a classic trick that requires Burt and Jane to huddle inside a box, which Anton jabs with swords.
"Burt Wonderstone" seems to be reaching for the tone of early Farrelly brothers movies like Kingpin, and also for the madcap hostility of Zoolander.
