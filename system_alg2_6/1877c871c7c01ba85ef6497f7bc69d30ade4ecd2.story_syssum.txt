(Rolling Stone) -- On July 25th, 1965, Bob Dylan walked onstage at the Newport Folk Festival, plugged in his 1964 sunburst Fender Stratocaster and tore through a scorching three-song set.
"Bob has possession of the electric guitar he played at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965," his attorney, Orin Snyder, said in a statement.
But experts make a strong case that the guitar in question is the same one Dylan played at the festival in 1965.
History Detectives also called in Dylan memorabilia collector Jeff Gold, who often helps auction houses authenticate items for sale.
"In one of these manuscripts, Dylan had written 'six flying horses,' and then above 'flying' he'd written 'white' and 'the.'
In 2005, Peterson wrote to Bob Dylan's management and requested that he waive any claim to the guitar.
"Things have crossed my mind."
