Jackson did not own the furnishings.
It sat in the kitchen where Jackson would eat lunch each day with Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson.
A small table that sat next to the bed where Jackson spent his last living hours in a desperate search for sleep sold for $5,000.
The auction house's re-creation of the bedroom where Jackson died -- euphemistically called "the medicine room" by the company -- features a bed-sized memorial covered with love notes from Jackson fans instead of the death bed.
The suit was settled in April 2009 when Julien's canceled the auction and later returned the items to Jackson.
