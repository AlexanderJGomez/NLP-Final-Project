(CNN) -- When I won the reality show competition "Survivor: Africa" in 2001, I never dreamed that an obscure African flower would provide the drug that later helped me survive cancer.
I won $1 million and the confidence that I could survive just about any challenge.
But as they worked I found some comfort when I learned that one of them was derived from an African flower, the rosy periwinkle.
Scientists figured this out years ago, and 80 percent of all anti-cancer drugs possess an active ingredient from the natural world.
According to the World Conservation Union, more than 16,000 species, plant and animal alike, are in danger of extinction, largely because of human activities.
I won "Survivor: Africa," and I've won my battle against cancer.
The rosy periwinkle saved my life.
