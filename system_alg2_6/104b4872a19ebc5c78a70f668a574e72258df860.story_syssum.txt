"I think it will change the whole industry," says Sengeh, who is from Sierra Leone.
But the horrors of war didn't prevent Sengeh from thinking big.
Next, he got into Harvard to study at its School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, before joining MIT's Media Lab.
But Sengeh is not only coming up with new creations that can impact lives and change industry.
"We do have the talent and young people within Sierra Leone, within Africa as a whole, to invent the future," he says.
Those are what's needed to develop products that will change the world.
