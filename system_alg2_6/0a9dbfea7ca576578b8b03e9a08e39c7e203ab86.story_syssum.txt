The legislation would require certain tax-exempt groups involved in political advertising -- which currently are not required to disclose the names of their donors -- to release the names of those who give donations of $10,000 or more.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, led the GOP charge against the bill and accused Democrats of crafting it to favor labor unions -- traditionally Democratic allies -- over other types of donors.
Democrats disagreed with the Republicans' assertion that labor unions are exempt from their legislation.
McCain argued that local union chapters would not have to disclose payments from individual members if the amount was less than $10,000.
