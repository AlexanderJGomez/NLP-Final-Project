The likes of Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) and Domino's pizza are opening up in African growth markets from Nigeria to Angola to give consumers a taste of U.S. cuisine.
In May, Burger King opened for business in South Africa and last year Domino's -- the U.S. pizza chain -- opened its first African store in Nigeria, the continent's most populous nation.
However, the cost of Western fast food brands in many parts of Africa relative to wages remains high, excluding many people, who simply cannot afford it.
Across the continent Western brands remain high compared to other parts of the world, according to Schulze.
The report also found Africans remain "exceptionally optimistic about their economic future" and very brand conscious in purchasing decisions.
