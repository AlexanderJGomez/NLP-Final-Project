Earlier, Czech Republic had kept their qualification hopes alive with a deserved 2-1 win over Greece, who can still qualify for the knockout stages if they beat Russia in their final game.
First, Petr Jiracek took advantage of an incisive pass from Joroslav Plasil to fire past Greece goalkeeper Kostas Chalkias.
The victory means Bilak's Czech side now have three points from two Group A games, but leaves Greece knowing that only a win against Russia in their final group game will give them any chance of reaching the knockout stages.
Instead, it was Russia who took control eight minutes before half-time.
Malafeev had no chance with that strike but rescued his side on three other occasions to ensure that Russia stay top of Group A -- but with everything to play for in Saturday's final round of group matches.
