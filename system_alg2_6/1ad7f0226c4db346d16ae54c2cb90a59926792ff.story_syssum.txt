I think (Russia has) done a first-class job for F1 and a super job for the Olympics," Ecclestone told CNN.
The Sochi circuit is the culmination of talks that first started in the 1980s, when a plan to run a race through Red Square in Moscow was abandoned -- "they didn't want to replace the cobblestones with paving," says Ecclestone -- and is a major statement of intent from Putin's government to secure the city's post-Games future.
F1 is a world championship, so it's difficult to think of leaving Russia out of a world event like this," Ecclestone said.
says Tilke, recalling his initial impressions of when he visited the Sochi site in 2010.
The promoter is hoping a race on Russian soil will attract many of the country's F1 fans who already travel the world to watch the championship, as well as creating a new domestic supporter base willing to pay $200 a ticket to attend.
Maybe the same will soon be said of the Sochi Grand Prix.
