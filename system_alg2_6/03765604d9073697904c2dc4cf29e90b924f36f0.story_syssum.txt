(CNN) -- Mexican President Felipe Calderon announced the resignations Tuesday of three high-level government officials, most notably Communications and Transport Secretary Luis Tellez Kuenzler.
In the taped conversation, Tellez said former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari had stolen government money.
Robert Pastor, the Latin America national security adviser for President Jimmy Carter in the 1970s, praised Tellez but said political considerations prevailed.
Replacing Tellez will be Juan Molinar Horcasitas, the head of the Mexican Institute for Social Security.
"The president is sending a signal to his party that he's going to support people from his own party," Slack said.
Consuelo Saizar Guerrero takes over as head of the National Council for Culture and the Arts, replacing Vela, whose reasons for resigning were not disclosed.
Meanwhile, Peter Hakim, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue, said the changes do not portend a political shift.
