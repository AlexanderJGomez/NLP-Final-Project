Washington (CNN) -- Mitt Romney on Tuesday didn't back away from remarks he made in a secretly recorded video casting supporters of President Barack Obama as dependent on welfare, and instead said the comments that generated more problems for him in a tight race were an honest reflection of his campaign's message.
"The president's view is one of larger government," Romney said.
"There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what," Romney says in one clip first posted on Monday afternoon.
In an interview taped for the "Late Show with David Letterman" in New York, Obama said he didn't know what Romney was referring to in the video but was quick to add, "One of the things I learned as president is you represent the entire country.
Too many people today who want to work are being forced into public assistance for lack of jobs," Brown said.
A CNN-ORC poll conducted after the Democratic convention showed Obama with a 52%-46% lead over Romney after the two were tied at 48% in the same poll the previous week.

In public, Romney has previously declared support for the two-state solution.
