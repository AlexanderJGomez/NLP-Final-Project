And "never mind," is what Speaker Boehner might just as well have said Thursday when he all but declared the immigration reform legislative debate dead for 2014.
Of course not, and it was just a week ago that the same Speaker Boehner said this of the same immigration debate:
Now, it appears testing that spirit of compromise will have to wait until 2015 or beyond.
"Nothing the House would do would ever become law," Castellanos said -- meaning that even if the House passed something, it was unlikely that differences with the Senate could be worked out this year.
The raw politics behind that view: In the 11 states where Senate seats now held by Democrats that are top GOP 2014 targets, conservative turnout is critical and the Latino population tiny to small.
"And the GOP wants to do nothing to distract from that, certainly not start a food fight on immigration."
