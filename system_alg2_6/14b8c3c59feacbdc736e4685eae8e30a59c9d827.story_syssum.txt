(CNN) -- A November 1 trial date has been set for Brian David Mitchell, who is suspected in the 2002 kidnapping of Utah teenager Elizabeth Smart, said a spokeswoman for federal prosecutors.
Earlier this month, Kimball ruled Mitchell, now 56, is competent to stand trial.
A state court had ruled she could be forcibly medicated, and that ruling led federal prosecutors to file charges against her.
Federal prosecutors have recommended that Barzee serve a sentence of 15 years, but asked that her sentencing date be continued to allow for her participation in the case against Mitchell.
