(CNN) -- The man who shot officers inside a Detroit police station had a relative who is scheduled to be sentenced for double homicide Monday, said the city's police chief, who would not confirm that as the motive behind the attack.
Brian Anderson was grazed in the head, he said.
"We will do whatever is necessary to provide an environment for our officers that is safe," Godbee said, but he wouldn't specify any immediate changes.
Counseling will be provided for officers affected by the shootings, said the chief.
