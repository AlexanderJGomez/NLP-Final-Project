Two goals from Steven Gerrard, both from the penalty spot and a Luis Suarez strike, condemned United to defeat and gave yet more credence that Liverpool is a serious title contender.
The Manchester United defense will not have had a harder game than against our strikers today.
Last season, United finished 28 points clear of Liverpool on its way to winning the Premier League title.
Liverpool dominated the opening 45 minutes and went ahead when Rafael, already on a yellow card, handled inside the penalty area.
Van Persie sent a header wide of the post as the home side attempted to gain a foothold in the game.
"We're going to win the league," sang the Liverpool supporters.
The victory moves Arsenal to within four points of leader Chelsea with a game in hand.
