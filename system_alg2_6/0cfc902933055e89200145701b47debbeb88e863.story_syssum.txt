Authorities say the elusive woman has killed at least two bus drivers in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.
In the e-mail, she calls herself "Diana, the hunter of drivers."
The slayings have terrorized many bus drivers, especially those operating Route 4, also known as the Yellow Route, which serves main thoroughfares and downtown Ciudad Juarez, a city of 1.5 million located across the border from El Paso, Texas.
Julian Vazquez, a bus driver on the same route, is one of those still behind the wheel, although he admits he's afraid.
According to an Amnesty International report, 370 young women and girl were killed in Ciudad Juarez between 1993 and 2005.
