Zhu Chun Yun lost her husband to cancer and now worries for her daughter's health.
Jingjing Zhang, an environmental lawyer who is working the villagers who want to sue the government, said the Dabaoshan mine has been polluting the Hengshui River for decades.
The Chinese ministry of health reported that increased pollution has made cancer the leading cause of death in the country.
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the United States imported $4.1 billion worth of seafood and agricultural products from China in 2006.
Water tests from Huanan Agricultural University have concluded the Hengshui is indeed too toxic for any human use, in stark contrast to what Jingjing said the government told the villagers.
China is trying to address its pollution problem.
