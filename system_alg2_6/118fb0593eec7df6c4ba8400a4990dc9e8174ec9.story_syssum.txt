Incumbent Sen. Mary Landrieu, a Democrat, and Republican challenger Rep. Bill Cassidy traded sharp allegations of personal misconduct in the final debate before the Louisiana Senate runoff, scheduled for Saturday, Dec. 6.
But in addition to defending himself, Cassidy was quick to fire back at Landrieu for using taxpayer dollars to fund her private campaign transportation, a violation for which she has apologized and reimbursed taxpayers for.
In addition to highlighting that Landrieu has voted with the President "97 percent of the time," Cassidy also tried to tie Landrieu to Jonathan Gruber, who served as an adviser during the law's drafting and whose controversial comments about the law and its passage have set off a conservative firestorm.
