(CNN) -- Ian Livingstone may not be the father of Lara Croft, but maybe at 63 he can be labeled the grandfather of Lara, the Tomb Raider.
And we had to have her.
Livingstone and his school friend Steve Jackson enjoyed playing board games, especially role-playing games.
They got the exclusive European distribution rights to the board game on the back of ordering just six copies of D&D, according to Livingstone, and the set about trying to sell the games to stores.
Now, with a CBE in the pocket and the honor title of Life President for Eidos -- a brand name now owned by Square Enix -- Livingstone is more of a advocate for the British video games and film graphics business.
As Livingstone likes to point out, the UK games and graphics business is bigger than the film industry.
"And now it's a realistic character.
Here was this character that you played as Lara, who could sustain damage."
With the reboot now out, it can't be long before we read of a new Lara Croft film with a new, younger, actress to set the mark for a new franchise.
