According to the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities, it's here, at a spot known as Abusir, that the tomb of Marc Antony and Cleopatra might be located.
"They were speaking very badly about her and about her image," she recalled.
It was "bad propaganda," in Martinez's words.
Marc Antony was a no less fascinating character than Cleopatra.
Octavian, according to Plutarch, allowed them to be buried together "in splendid and regal fashion."
The sudden focus on Antony and Cleopatra has also reignited an old debate over the latter's looks.
At Abusir, he showed me one of the coins with Cleopatra's likeness.
In any event, it's just one of many mysteries in Egypt.
Who built them?
There has been plenty of excitement in the past few days over reports that Martinez and her team are about to find the long-lost tomb of Antony and Cleopatra.
I guess we can wait a few more months.
