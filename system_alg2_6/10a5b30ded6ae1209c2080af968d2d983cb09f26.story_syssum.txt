At least 50 rockets were fired at Israel after the cease-fire expired Friday morning, the Israel Defense Forces said.
Hamas, the Islamic militant group that holds power in Gaza, said that Palestinian officials at peace talks in Cairo hadn't agreed to extend the truce but would continue negotiations.
In Hebron, at least 40 people were hurt during clashes between Palestinians and Israeli military and border police near the old city.
Two rockets fired from Gaza hit southern Israel a few hours before the truce was due to end Friday, the IDF said.
Abu Zuhri said Israel was willing to extend fishing rights to only six miles off the coast.
Abu Zuhri said the Palestinian delegation arrived in Cairo five days in advance in an effort to reach a cease-fire agreement, but the Palestinian delegation did not receive an Israeli response to its demands.
As result, the Palestinian delegation, collectively, decided not to extend the cease fire agreement," said Abu Zuhri.
It's unclear how many of the Palestinian dead were militants.
Additionally, about 65,000 Gaza residents lost their homes to the fighting, according to U.N. estimates.
