(CNN) -- Whoever is running the social media strategy for the New York Police Department needs to be fired because that person has no idea how to follow the rules of social media.
Remember the PR executive from media company IAC who sent out a racially offensive tweet and raised a firestorm?
Facebook users are a different demographic than Twitter users, just as Pinterest users are different from Instagram users.
If you need to control the conversation, use Facebook.
And they jumped all over #myNYPD using the Occupy Wall Street NYC Twitter account.
If you want to use social media to promote a brand, either use the rules to pick the right platform and own the conversation or social media will own you.
Unfortunately, common sense, safe driving and social media rules are a lot like deodorant, the people who need it the most don't use it.
