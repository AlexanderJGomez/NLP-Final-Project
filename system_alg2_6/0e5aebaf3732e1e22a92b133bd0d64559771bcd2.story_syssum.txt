(CNN) -- Let's be clear: Israel's latest operation in Gaza is not about security.
But at the end of the day, the loss of Palestinian lives will far exceed that of Israelis.
There are arguably two other factors behind Israel's new operation.
The second reason for the attacks on Gaza is that Israel may be testing the boundaries of the changes brought about by the Arab uprisings to see just how far it can push the U.S., Egypt, and the Palestinian leadership.
At the same time, PA head Mahmoud Abbas has been urging Arab and international action to bring about an end to the fighting and speaking of reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas.
It is imperative to end the bloodshed now, and then work for a just peace that will end it for all time.
