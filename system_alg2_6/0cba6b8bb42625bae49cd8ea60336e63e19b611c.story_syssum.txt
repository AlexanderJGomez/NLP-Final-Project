"Coming here, you can feel supported by other people working on their businesses and feel less alone," said Chan, who goes to the co-working space CoCoon, where he works on his Internet start-up, wholedaybuy.com.
Thought to have first started in San Francisco in 2005 with Citizen Space, co-working spaces are now widespread in the U.S. and Europe and are making headway in Asia, courting mostly people in their 20s and 30s working on projects solo or in small teams.
"There's definitely this emerging segment of people who don't want to project a corporate image, but they want a comfortable space to work," he says.
"We think Hong Kong can use another place to foster entrepreneurs, and we hope talent can collaborate amongst themselves," says Erica Ma, one of CoCoon's founders.
So for Jah Ying Chung, who is starting launchpilots.org, a site that helps young people get involved in social causes, going to CoCoon provides motivation.
