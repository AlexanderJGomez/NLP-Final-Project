"My heartfelt and deepest sympathies go out to the family and loved ones, and to all of those who were involved or injured in this terrible accident," Jenner said in a statement released Sunday by his publicist, Alan Nierob.
Jenner first catapulted to fame after winning the 1976 Olympic decathlon and now draws the celebrity spotlight for his role on the "Keeping Up With the Kardashians" reality show.
Jenner's Escalade was towing a trailer with an all-terrain vehicle on it when it ran into the Lexus from behind, Brooks said.
Jenner, 65, was not injured in the crash, publicist Alan Nierob said.
The Sheriff's Department said on its Facebook page that the surviving drivers were cooperating with investigators.
The driver was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence, Parker wrote.
