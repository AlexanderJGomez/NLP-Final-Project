Havens told Billboard that his breakthrough at Woodstock came after another artist's equipment got stuck in traffic.
Havens, a Brooklyn, New York, native, told CNN in 1999 that music enabled him to leave his rough neighborhood to head to Greenwich Village and the music scene there.
"I came up in Brooklyn singing doo-wop music from the time I was 13 to the time I was 20.
"It was the songs that actually changed my life," he says.
Stephen Stills of Crosby, Stills and Nash said Havens was an inspiration for the natural gravel in his singing voice.
"But he sure knew what to do when they were begging for someone to go on first, when all those people showed up at Woodstock," Stills said.
