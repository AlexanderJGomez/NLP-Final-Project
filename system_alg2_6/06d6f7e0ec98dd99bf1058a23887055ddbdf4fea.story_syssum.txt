People forget how hostile House Republicans were to Clinton -- hell, they impeached him -- but he nonetheless worked with them to pass four straight balanced budgets and an overhaul of welfare.
One of the foremost duties of Congress is to pass a budget: It has failed for four straight years.
Republicans, especially in the House, have continually refused to meet the White House halfway.
Perhaps, but in the meantime, the president and the Congress have one solemn and urgent responsibility: Having created this mess, they must -- stress must -- work together to minimize the disruptions and hardships that they are promising will happen.
Administration spokesmen say their hands are tied by the sequestration law because it requires even, across-the-board cuts.
The concern about excessive power is legitimate, but surely a way can be found so that the White House and Congress would share power and any other arrangements be strictly limited in time.
But in the meantime, Obama and Congress have a duty to lead -- and that means to pass a bill that will minimize disruption and pain.
