Delgarde explains the process for making paint in Haiti.
He told them, "I want to collect your paint and take it someplace where people don't have access to paint.
So far, Delgarde has donated 6,000 gallons of paint to projects in Kenya, Haiti and Uganda.
Ed Spencer, a consultant in Atlanta, says he donated his paint for several reasons.
"I was really excited to hear about Global Paint and the use for the paint in Third World nations because we have such a hard time getting rid of paint, and this kills two birds with one stone.
"We used to have a small warehouse where we would process the paint.
But we need someplace where we can process the paint," he says.
"We will be able to make 3,000 gallons of paint per day if we have that machine.
We bring joy with the paint we were able to donate.
