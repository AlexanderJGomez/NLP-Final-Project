LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Holly Williams is one of the only artists in country music male or female who doesn't have a stylist.
Williams just released her sophomore album, "Here With Me" (Mercury Nashville).
Williams spoke with CNN about her new album and her family's legacy.
Holly Williams: It wasn't planned at all.
Williams: Well, my mom raised my sister and me.
CNN: What was it like for you going into the music industry?
I'm 28 now, and I've been doing it for 10 years nonstop.
Williams: I do.
I'm sure people just laughed.
Williams: Growing up in my house, you would assume I was growing up around country music with my dad being Hank Williams Jr.
CNN: You also own a clothing boutique in Nashville called H. Audrey.
