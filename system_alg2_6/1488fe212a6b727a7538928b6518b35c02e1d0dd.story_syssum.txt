"The fishing industry has slowed from a full-time job to just a couple months a year," said Doug Monk, the captain of the boat from which Woodside dives.
But thanks to a small piece of the federal stimulus recovery plan, Monk, Woodside and about 40 other fishermen will get back to work hauling in a very different catch: lost fishing nets.
The only reason the nets have remained underwater for so long, said Ginny Broadhurst, director of the Northwest Marine Conservation Initiative, is because the damage they are doing to the environment is invisible from the surface.
But pulling those nets is no easy task.
In just a few hours on the water, the divers can pull free about 1,000 pounds of nets.
But biologist June said the group is working on a plan that would have the nets burned, creating energy from lost fishing nets.
"[With] harvest diving we are taking from the resources; here we are giving them back."
