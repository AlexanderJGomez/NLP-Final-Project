"It's a big problem," explains major Jean Attala, deputy operations officer of the Seychelles coast guard.
To deal with the threat of piracy, the country's authorities had to change the way they manage their waters in recent years.
"There's no fish," explains local fisherman Patrick Pierre.
He says fish intake has fallen nearly 25% in the last five years.
Since 2006, the year the World Bank report takes as the starting point of piracy, exports of fish products from piracy-hit countries have declined by 23.8%.
"Five years ago, there was a lot of fish," says Pierre.
