(CNN)In his State of the Union address, President Obama proposed making community college tuition free for two years to boost college graduation rates and lift more people into the middle class.
Even for those who earn a community college degree, it often isn't as useful as other options.
The larger question the proposal misses is not how to allow students to afford college, but how to make college affordable.
There's a huge distinction.
Rather than supporting innovative options like Patten and Southern New Hampshire, the President's plan would nudge students toward a community college sector that is incapable of repositioning its model around student success and fuel rising college costs.
We need a better strategy for skills training overall before we go further down the track of subsidizing students to attend community college only to emerge with little to show for it.
