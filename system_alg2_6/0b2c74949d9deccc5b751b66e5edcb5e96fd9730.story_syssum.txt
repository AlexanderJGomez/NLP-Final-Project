Correa said Ecuador would be cautious about processing any asylum request from Snowden.
Correa said that the first ones to be consulted "would be the U.S. as we did in the Assange case with England."
Correa said neither he nor officials in Quito authorized travel documents that diplomats in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London issued to Snowden.
This consul will face the necessary sanctions," Correa said.
The South American country is now in the international spotlight as a global manhunt continues for Snowden, a fugitive who has admitted leaking classified documents about U.S. surveillance programs.
