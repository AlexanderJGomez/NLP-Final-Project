ISIS had demanded her release, threatening to kill two hostages if Jordan didn't comply.
The online posts, which CNN could not verify independently, appeared four days after an ISIS video demanded that the Japanese government pay $200 million within 72 hours for the hostages' release.
"They are just demanding the release of their imprisoned sister Sajida al-Rishawi," the voice said.
Jordanian authorities said al-Rishawi, now in her 40s, joined her husband, Hussein Ali al-Shamari, to carry out the suicide bombings at the Radisson hotel.
Jordanian authorities at the time said the attacks were orchestrated by the terrorist group al Qaeda in Iraq, which was led by Jordanian-born Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.
After the Jordan attacks, Muasher told CNN that al-Rishawi was not wearing an explosives belt when she was apprehended, but two belts were found with her.
Muasher said Jordanian authorities had information that al-Rishawi's husband "asked her to step out of the room" when her explosives failed to detonate.
