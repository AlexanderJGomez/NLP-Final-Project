The burning of the Qurans -- which the U.S. claims was accidental -- was a fresh outrage to many Afghans.
In contrast, Sunday's mass murder is not a new outrage for Afghanistan.
So where does the war go from here?
Because there is no political strategy for the war -- nothing that takes Afghan and Taliban politics into consideration -- the U.S. has no concept of how to manage or react to the political consequences of incidents like Sunday's rampage.
But shifting Afghanistan from a military engagement to a political one would, by design, extend U.S. operations there.
Abandoning Afghanistan will impose huge costs in Afghanistan but the last ten years of directionless fighting has left Americans tired and frustrated with a war that seems to go nowhere but down.
