(CNN) -- On July 13, 2013, a Florida jury found George Zimmerman not guilty in the death of Trayvon Martin.
The U.S. Department of Justice investigation into whether Zimmerman violated Martin's rights is still ongoing.
She had taken the Zimmerman case near the end of her one-year rotation in the criminal courts.
Crump regularly speaks at conferences on race relations and is currently representing the family of Robbie Tolan, a former baseball player shot in Texas by a police officer in 2008.
O'Mara, who does not currently represent George Zimmerman, is now flush with new business and is a current CNN legal contributor.
The ousted former Sanford, Florida, police chief, who took the brunt of criticism about how the initial investigation in the shooting was conducted, is now working as a special agent with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's Orlando Regional Operations Center Public Integrity Squad.
Alternate juror E54 told WOFL he "supported the verdict."
Juror B37, the first juror to speak, told CNN that Zimmerman was "justified in shooting Trayvon Martin" but that he "had good in his heart, he just went overboard."
