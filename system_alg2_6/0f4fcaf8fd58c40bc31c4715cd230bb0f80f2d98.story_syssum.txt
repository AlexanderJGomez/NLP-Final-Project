Mazza was being transported in a medical van because of a medical condition, Lamberti said.
Mazza and Rein left about 8:05 a.m., Lamberti said.
After the shooting, Mazza is believed to have thrown Rein from the van and driven away.
When the man arrived at the second pawn shop, he left Mazza in the car and went inside, Lamberti said.
Mazza initially was reluctant to talk to authorities, but later agreed, and confessed to shooting Rein, the sheriff said.
Broward County also has a pending case against Mazza -- a February drugstore robbery in Pompano Beach, he said.
Broward County deputies conduct some 400 to 500 inmate court transports a day -- one deputy transporting up to a handful of inmates, Lamberti said.
The deputy was memorialized Wednesday on the Web site of the Broward County Sheriff's Office.
