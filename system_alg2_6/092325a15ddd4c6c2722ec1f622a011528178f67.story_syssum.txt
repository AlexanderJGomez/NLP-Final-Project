A U.S. Government Accountability Office investigation that concluded in May showed that several Head Start workers committed fraud to enroll families whose incomes were above the federally mandated limit.
Documents that whistleblowers leaked to the GAO showed that some workers admitted children whose parents made more than $110,000.
A 10-year study released in 2010 by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services showed that Head Start kids are better prepared academically and socially to enter kindergarten.
The investigators' documents showed they made too much money to enroll, but at eight of the 15 Head Start centers they approached, staff members pretended they hadn't seen the income levels, or they urged parents to lie.
The problem, Kutz said, is that Head Start workers only have to sign a statement that they've seen proof of parents' incomes.
Not all Head Start programs have been letting the income rules slide.
According to Sanchez Fuentes, Head Start officials advised local directors about enrollment procedures, bulked up on admissions training and now make unannounced visits to local programs.
"We will make sure that when we go out to see these local programs, that they are indeed doing the right things and that every federal dollar that goes to Head Start is not being misused."
"I know they could do a much better job."
