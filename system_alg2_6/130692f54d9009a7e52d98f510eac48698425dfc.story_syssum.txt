With fewer lawmakers voting, conservatives will need more Boehner opponents to force the vote to a second ballot.
Rep. Justin Amash, one of the original dozen that opposed Boehner for speaker in 2013, said in a Facebook post that while "Speaker Boehner has given his best to our conference...it's time for Republicans to change our leadership."
"We're at over a dozen right now and you're going to see more people get on and decide not to vote for the current leadership," Yoho said Tuesday on CNN's New Day.
"It's either a vote for the status quo or for a new direction for the Republican Party."
