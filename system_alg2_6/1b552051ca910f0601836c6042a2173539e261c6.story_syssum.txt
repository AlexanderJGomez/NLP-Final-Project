May 22: A car with a 1-year-old girl inside is stolen near a Georgia day care.
The man is arrested and the kid is safe.
Between the program's inception in 1996 and July of this year, at least 656 children have been rescued because citizens saw or heard an Amber Alert, according to the center, which works with law enforcement, broadcasters and federal authorities on the nationwide program.
On August 4, a 10-second, high-pitched tone rang on thousands of mobile phones across the West Coast -- the first use of a new wireless alert system.
When authorities heard that DiMaggio might be heading into Nevada, the alerts were expanded to that state, Hoever said.
"The wireless program was also used in five states at one time," Hoever said.
But when they got home, they saw Hannah's Amber Alert on television.
Amber stands for "America's Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response," but its namesake was Amber Hagerman, a 9-year-old Texas girl who was last seen alive riding her bike in a parking lot in January 1996, according to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.
The motorist "called into law enforcement saying, 'I'm riding next to the car that you're looking for!'
The police tracked down the vehicle and rescued the baby.
