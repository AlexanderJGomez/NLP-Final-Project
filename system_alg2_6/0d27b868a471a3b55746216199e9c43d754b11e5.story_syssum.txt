Are you involved in your kid's school?
Alex has been in school for a week now.
I don't have the time or desire to be that much of a super mom (for now), but I do want to be involved.
And my (limited) free time.
At all.
Are you involved in yours?
Kids get a kick out of seeing their parents at school, right?
