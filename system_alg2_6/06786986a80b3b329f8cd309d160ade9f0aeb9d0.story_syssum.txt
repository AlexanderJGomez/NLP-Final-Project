Football or soccer?
Soccer would have been used to differentiate between University sports rugby football ("rugger") and "association" football.
In later years, it became the United States Soccer Football Association and today is known as the United States Soccer Federation.
If you are thinking that, just remember one of the most popular shows in Britain is called "Soccer Saturday", so it's not as clear cut as you may think!
We'd like you to tell us whether the game should be called football or soccer and why.
