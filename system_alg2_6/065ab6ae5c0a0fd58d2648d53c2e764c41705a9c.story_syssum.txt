McLaughlin had struggled with weight his entire life.
"I would eat and drink a lot, which played havoc with the weight."
Between the two of them, McLaughlin says they would split three bottles of wine with dinner.
Now he follows the Slimming World plan and prepares his meals at home.
"Now I tend to drink wine only, and I enjoy and savor the taste instead of just drinking for the sake and experience," McLaughlin says.
"It's hard to go to the gym after work," he says.
In the last three years, McLaughlin has lost 140 pounds.
