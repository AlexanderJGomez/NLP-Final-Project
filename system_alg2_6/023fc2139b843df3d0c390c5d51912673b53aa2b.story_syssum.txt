The mysterious image captured by Chris Aitchison at Tantallon Castle in eastern Scotland.
"Staff have verified that there were no sinister dummies in period costume or historical reenactments going on that day at the castle.
The photographer insists no one was around when he took the picture; skeptics say the mirror could be reflecting the headrest or be the result of digital manipulation.
"Orbs can be caused by the camera flash reflecting off tiny dust particles, mists can result from condensed breath in front of the lens, long exposures can create ghostly figures, and apparent faces are often people seeing patterns in random shapes."
It is also possible that a member of the public was standing there when the picture was taken, Wiseman said -- in which case, he hopes they will come forward.
"I think it's probably a person who's been caught in slightly odd dress," Wiseman told CNN.
It later emerged that a member of staff wearing a medieval costume was the person in the video.
