Los Angeles (CNN) -- Paul Walker's brothers are helping "fill in small gaps" in "Fast & Furious 7" action sequences not finished before the actor's death, producers said Tuesday.
"Caleb and Cody are helping us complete some remaining action for their brother and fill in small gaps left in production.
Investigators concluded in a report released in March that speed was to blame in Walker's death.
Investigators found "no pre-existing conditions that would have caused this collision," the report said.
The crash happened a few hundred yards away on a wide street.
