Santana recalled the moments when he recorded a roughly three-minute video of North Charleston Police officer Michael Slager shooting Walter Scott as Scott was running away Saturday.
Police said Slager used a Taser against Scott, but Slager would also later tell a dispatcher that Scott at some point had grabbed the Taser.
Santana thinks it was the Taser but said he wasn't 100% sure what it was.
"He was there.
Judy Scott said she couldn't watch the whole recording.
But ... if I wouldn't show my face, everybody over there knows, including the police, who I am," Santana said.
Santana said after he stopped recording, he watched for a few more minutes but never saw anyone perform CPR.
