The high value in North Korea of the Choco Pie, something considered so widespread and mundane in South Korea, is  "a sad tragic story," said the artist, Jin Jo Chae.
"Through this Choco Pie, I found the potential from chocolate as an object that changes a society," Chae said.
The South Korean factory owner, who introduced his North Korean workers to Choco Pies, washed down with a Coca Cola, said the products seemed to leave an impression on his staff.
Choco Pie and Coca Cola were the standard snacks with other South Korean managers at Kaesong.
The snacks spread to North Korea's informal markets, valued in the marketplace as about $10 in purchasing power, and holding something of a sweet spot for North Koreans, said Noerper.
But Park Sang Hak, a prominent North Korean defector who regularly sends leaflets and supplies from South Korea, said the Choco Pies are not ideal for the balloons, because they weigh too much and crumble.
Through all the stories about noise and misinformation about North Korea, perhaps the Choco Pie is a reminder of an aspect missing in the narratives about the country, said Noerper.
