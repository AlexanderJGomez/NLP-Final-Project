The work of this U.S. attorney's office is unglamorous, especially for new hires.
She is a workhorse, not a show horse, and she has flourished doing the hard, ordinary work of federal prosecution -- narcotics cases, organized crime (always big in Brooklyn), public corruption (ditto) and civil rights violations.
First, will she continue the emphasis on voting rights that Eric Holder displayed?
Will Lynch continue these efforts?
In any event, one verdict is clear: Lynch has come a long way from that basement we shared.
