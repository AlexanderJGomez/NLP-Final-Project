"The estate of Robert Read made its first distributions to Brattleboro Memorial Hospital and the Brooks Library in the amounts of $4.8 million and $1.2 million," Read's attorney said in a press release.
"To find out that he had left this money to the hospital was a great surprise," Pattison said.
Though his jobs never yielded large salaries, Read enjoyed investing in the stock market, always putting his money into "dividend producing stocks," Rowell said.
Besides his frugality, Rowell described Read as a quintessential "Vermonter."
