But we have a global sanitation crisis.
Saturday marks the 10th anniversary of World Toilet Day, a day set aside not simply as a celebration of this most venerable and useful of technologies, but as a way to draw attention to the crisis and some possible solutions.
A small but dedicated community that includes governments, NGOs, donors and research institutions is working to expand access to basic sanitation services in developing countries.
One answer may be that the kinds of sanitation facilities offered to developing country households are not terribly appealing.
In order to turn the tide on the global sanitation crisis, however, efforts are also needed to develop models for low- and no-water sanitation systems at scale, models to which municipal and national governments themselves can aspire.
Certainly, most people don't want to talk about poop, much less debate whether and how it might be recycled in their communities.
