Hong Kong (CNN)A court in Hong Kong has thrown out an application for a 14-year-old girl to be removed from her family after she was arrested for drawing chalk flowers on a wall at a pro-democracy protest site in Hong Kong.
When an application for a care and protection order is made, the social welfare department is expected to produce a report assessing the needs and the care of the children or juveniles involved.
The boy was arrested during the police clear out of the Mong Kok protest site last year.
Thirty protest leaders, including the three founders of Occupy Central with Love and Peace and several prominent student leaders, have been called by the police to report to the police headquarters in Wan Chai district, where they could possibly be arrested and prosecuted for their involvement with the two-month long protest.
