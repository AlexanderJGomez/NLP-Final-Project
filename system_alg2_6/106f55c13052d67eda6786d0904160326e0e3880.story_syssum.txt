At one kilometer (0.6 miles) high, the largest of the two Phoenix Towers planned for Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in central China, will be the tallest in the world if completed on schedule in 2017/2018.
The design is inspired by dualism in Chinese culture -- the traditional Chinese phoenix symbol of the two birds, "Feng" and "Huang," as well as the idea of yin and yang.
Three large spheres containing celestial-themed restaurants accessible via "skywalks" will be suspended between the two towers.
The towers are designed to have green features such as pollution-absorbing surfaces to filter the city's air as well as technology to aerate and filter the water.
