Bono suffered a serious back injury Friday while preparing for the resumption of the band's U.S. tour, the band said, and had emergency surgery.
Tonn said Bono was in severe pain and had already suffered partial paralysis in his lower leg when he was referred.
U2 Manager Paul McGuinness said the band is working with Live Nation to reschedule the tour dates.
