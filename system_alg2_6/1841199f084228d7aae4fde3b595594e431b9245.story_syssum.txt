The embassy will continue to operate from the current building until the new one is completed in 2016 or 2017, the embassy said.
It has now settled on a site in Wandsworth and is having a design competition for the new building.
The embassy moved to its current site, occupying the entire west side of the square, when the building was completed in 1960.
It is not clear whether the eagle will be considered part of the building's listed status, meaning it will have to stay on the facade, or whether it can be moved to the new location, according to a spokesman for the realty firm Cushman and Wakefield, which advised the United States on the sale.
