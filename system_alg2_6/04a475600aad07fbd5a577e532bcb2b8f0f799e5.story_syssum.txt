WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Richard M. Nixon and his Brazilian counterpart, Emilio Medici, in 1971 discussed ways their countries could work together to overthrow the socialist government of Salvador Allende in Chile, according to a newly declassified document.
"This is an explosive document that details collusion between the colossus of the North [the United States] and the colossus of the South [Brazil]," said Peter Kornbluh, the director of a Chile and Brazil Documentation Project for the National Security Archive.
A declassified CIA memorandum written some time after the Nixon-Medici meeting in Washington said that word of the secret talks between the two leaders about shaping Brazilian foreign policy filtered down to Brazilian military officers by a "Cabinet leak."
The National Security Archive will push for the declassification and publication of more top-secret documents from the Nixon library, he said, and will approach Brazilian government officials to ask for their cooperation in getting documents released in Washington and Brasilia, the capital of Brazil.
