England has not had much to smile about in recent months but perhaps it will allow itself time to enjoy a rare moment of success.
Danny Welbeck, who recently signed for Arsenal after completing a move from Manchester United, scored both goals as England produced an encouraging performance.
Both goals came as a result of counter attacks with Welbeck finishing off Raheem Sterling's cross on 58 minutes after England had caught Switzerland short in defense.
"This team has a lot of quality and excellent players and it was just a matter of time before we scored," Valencia's Alcacer told TVE.
In Kiev, Ukraine suffered a 1-0 home defeat by Slovakia in with Robert Mak scoring the only goal of the game for the visitors.
