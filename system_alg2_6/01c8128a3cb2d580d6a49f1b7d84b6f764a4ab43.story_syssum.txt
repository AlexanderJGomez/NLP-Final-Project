Those of us who know Newt Gingrich tend to describe him as not only intelligent but also charming.
Talk to hugely successful people, Gingrich said, and most of them will say that they got an early start learning about jobs and responsibility and earning money for their labor.
Or you can say that many of these teenagers are unemployable because no one ever taught them the skills necessary to hold down a job.
Here's the obvious: Americans have lost their work ethic, and some never had one to lose.
Upper-middle class kids can be harder to motivate, especially if they've never been taught to work by their parents.
They gave them a list of chores to do to earn their allowances.
Today, parents find it easier to skip the chores and buy their kids what they want, which is no good for anyone and no good for society.
Newt Gingrich had the courage to mention the problem of America's vanishing work ethic, and emphasize the need to restore it.
