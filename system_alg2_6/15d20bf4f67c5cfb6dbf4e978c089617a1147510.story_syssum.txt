Shortly after Guzman Salazar's arrest in October, a U.S. federal official told CNN that she was the daughter of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, who authorities have said heads Mexico's Sinaloa cartel.
Guzman Salazar is between seven and eight months' pregnant, Valencia said.
She entered with a false visa in October because she wanted to give birth in the United States, he said.
The U.S. Treasury Department has declared him the most influential trafficker in the world, and Mexican authorities have been on his tail since his 2001 escape from a Mexican prison in a laundry cart.
