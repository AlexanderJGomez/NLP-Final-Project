(CNN) -- Theresa Borawski sat down heavily on a neighbor's porch, somewhere in between her front door and her good friend's driveway.
But the victory was sweet for a woman who just six months before had primarily relied on a wheelchair to get around, a woman who had lived in her house for two years without walking to the mailbox.
"Today, I am 276 pounds lighter, 14 jean sizes smaller, and no longer need a wheelchair, walker or cane to get around.
She was heavy throughout high school and college but says her weight never really affected her life until 2003, when a series of setbacks sent her into a downward spiral.
"I already knew she was dedicated," Bowden says.
By January 2011, "my life was in complete chaos," Borawski says.
"With the (arthritis) and the extra weight, I got very concerned that she might ... not be able to take care of herself."
She got up, rode around in her wheelchair, popped painkillers, ate and went to bed every night at 7 p.m. "Every bit of energy I had went to just living."
When the sister hung up, Borawski went to the refrigerator and took out a bottle of peach soda.
I lost 45 pounds between March and Memorial Day."
In October 2011, Borawski walked to her mailbox without a cane for the first time.
Every time she lost 20 pounds, Borawski went to the store and bought a pair of pants in the next size smaller.
"The first row of black diamonds is the first 100 pounds, the second row is the second 100 pounds," she says.
