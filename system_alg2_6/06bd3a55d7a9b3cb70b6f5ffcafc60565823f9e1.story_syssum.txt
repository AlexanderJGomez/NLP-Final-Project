New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Seventy-two police officers were killed in an attack early Tuesday by suspected Maoists in eastern India, authorities said.
"I am confident that the state governments concerned will gradually gain the upper hand and re-establish the authority of the civil administration," Chidambaram told an internal security conference on February 7.
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, however, conceded last year that the nation's fight with the Maoists had fallen short of objectives.
