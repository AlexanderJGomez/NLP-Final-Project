Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Tribesmen killed five Yemeni soldiers guarding Yemen's strategic Balhaf gas terminal Sunday, two security officials said.
The soldiers were armed but were not able to defend themselves as the attack happened quick and sudden," a security official in the province said.
Four western embassies in Yemen have been closed since August 4, after U.S. intelligence intercepted information that al Qaeda may target American interests in the region.
