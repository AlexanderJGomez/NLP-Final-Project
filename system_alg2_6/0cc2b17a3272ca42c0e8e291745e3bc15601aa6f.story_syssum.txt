A grand jury in Travis County indicted Perry, a Republican, on two felony counts stemming from his threat to veto funding for a statewide public integrity unit run by Travis Country District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, a Democrat, unless she stepped down, according to the special prosecutor in the case, Michael McCrum.
According to McCrum, the indictment alleges that the circumstances around Perry's veto threat amounted to a misuse of state money earmarked by the Legislature to fund the public integrity unit in Travis County run by Lehmberg.
"We don't settle political differences with indictments in this country," Perry said.
Perry's presidential prospects could be damaged.
That's what this case is all about --- the facts and the law, and nothing else."
But the Texas Democratic Party called on Perry to resign, saying in a written statement that the governor "brought  dishonor to his office, his family and the state of Texas.
He resigned.
