Established in 2007 following the Red Mosque siege, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), or Pakistani Taliban, is now a prominent actor in that country's politics.
However TTP violence over the years should not be underestimated.
This year, the Pakistani state relied more on airstrikes than in previous years, leading to claims of higher than ever civilian casualty rates, but also greater the usual number of TTP combatant deaths.
Schools, especially girls' schools, are a frequent target of the TTP.
The TTP -- convinced of the possibility of a pure perfect Islamic order -- seeks to exclude from public politics and from the public spaces those that are "unperfectable:" women, homosexuals and the unrighteous who support infidels.
It also reflects their broader aim to confine politics to a restricted group of people ("righteous males"), a limited range of activities (excluding fine arts and public expressions of merriment), and a severely constrained public space.
