In 2009, Obama's first full year in office, people in states across the country were losing their jobs at a startling clip.
Also during the debate, GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney said that 23 million people are out of work in the nation.
Look at the evidence of the last four years.
That means that, while the nation has replaced lost jobs, many of those new jobs pay less than the old ones did.
No president has been re-elected with an unemployment rate above 8% since Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s, during the Great Depression.
