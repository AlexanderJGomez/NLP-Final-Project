One of Schettino's lawyers, Salvatore Parascandola, said the defense team was "optimistic" that he would be freed from house arrest.

According to the transcript, Schettino said he ran the ship aground to keep it from sinking.
But in statements made during a phone conversation with a friend, Schettino said managers pressured him to steer the ship to the area where the collision occurred, two Italian newspapers reported Wednesday.
The information should not have been published, he said, as it is part of the investigation.
In the transcript, Schettino also described the chaos, saying that he helped passengers onto lifeboats and that some became stuck because of the angle of the listing ship.
A captain's leaving the ship with passengers still aboard is difficult to defend, said Italian criminal defense attorney Ugo Meucci, who does not represent Schettino.
