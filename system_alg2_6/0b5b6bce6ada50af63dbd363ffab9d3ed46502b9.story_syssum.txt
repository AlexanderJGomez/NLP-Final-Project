My mom was a very good cook.
On holidays, we would go to work with her.
I started baking.
We went to Mass once a week, while in school, as well as on Sundays.
I've certainly called on God when I'm in the kitchen, when things are going wrong, when I'm irritated or very upset about something.
But now I feel very strongly, and I know in my heart that I'm ready to do it.
I have a spiritual director I work with, and I started out with that at first.
I will miss the people.
I would love to do something for the needy or poor, during the holidays when people really feel their lowest.
I want to give all of myself, and I don't think you can do that when you have a lot of baggage.
The prayer life, the rules that a priest is supposed to live by, that really excites me.
