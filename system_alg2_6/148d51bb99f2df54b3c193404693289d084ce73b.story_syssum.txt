(CNN) -- The mayor of Nogales, Arizona, was arrested Tuesday on charges he took bribes to protect contracts or obtain business contracts with the city, the state attorney general said.
The mayor's next hearing was scheduled for October 4.
At least one business admitted to the FBI that it was paying the mayor to use his official position to obtain business contracts and, specifically, to obtain new city of Nogales contracts, the attorney general stated.
The money orders were then cashed by Garcia-Von Borstel and deposited into a bank account he controlled, the statement said.
