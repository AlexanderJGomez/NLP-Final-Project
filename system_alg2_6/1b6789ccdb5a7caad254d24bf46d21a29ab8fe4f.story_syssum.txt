While at the car repair facility, look for certifications displayed on the wall.
I get the same question from my readers over and over: "How do I find a good auto repair shop?!
Before I start, I want to emphasize that the question "How do I find a good auto repair shop?"
i.e.
First of all, start shopping for a repair facility BEFORE you need one.
Why?
In addition to having state-of-the-art equipment, training, qualified technicians, and information systems in place, the shop must score high with its customers.
Ask customers in the shop, "Why do you do business with this shop?"

?
In addition, membership in these associations usually means that the shop is willing to subject itself to an arbitration process that is binding, should the need for arbitration between customer and shop arise.
Don't be afraid to ask the shop if they have this equipment.
Why?
Some people think that the cost of repair varies with the size of the shop (a large shop or dealership is probably more expensive).
These days, with the high cost of equipment, training, and information systems, the cost of repair at dealerships, large repair facilities and small shops is balancing out.
Pick your repair facility like you would your family doctor.
