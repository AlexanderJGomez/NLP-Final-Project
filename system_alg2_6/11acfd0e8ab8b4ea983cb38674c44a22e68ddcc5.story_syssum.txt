Unfortunately, Gareth Edwards' "Godzilla" feels like two movies Scotch-taped together.
Only one of these movies is any good.
When Godzilla first lumbers on screen to hunt the MUTOs and ''restore balance,'' he feels both nostalgically familiar and excitingly new.
Godzilla is humanity's only hope for destroying the MUTOs.
