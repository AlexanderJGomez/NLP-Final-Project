Sheriff Jerry Whitehead told CNN affiliate WJXT that  the Lake Butler "community is in shock," after 72-year-old Hubert Allen Jr. allegedly went on a shooting spree, killing his longtime boss, Marvin Pritchett, 80, and a former co-worker Rolando Gonzalez-Delgado, 28.
The Union County Sheriff's Office said Allen went to a Lake Butler farm owned by Pritchett, where he fatally shot Gonzalez-Delgado.
Allen traveled to Pritchett Trucking Inc. and shot a third co-worker, 44-year old David Griffis, in the stomach, officials said.
Griffis was taken to the hospital for immediate surgery; he was in critical condition.
