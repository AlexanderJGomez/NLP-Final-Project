The central government of leftist President Evo Morales, Bolivia's first leader from an Indian majority centered in the western highlands, is conducting talks with governors of largely white provinces in the east who want autonomy.
The government of Evo Morales took power by a majority and now these opposition governors don't want to let him govern," Torrico said.
"This is probably one of the few opportunities that we're going to have to solve the problems of the country," he said.
Morales has said the opposition leaders are trying to overthrow the government.
Ivan Canelas, a government spokesman, said the talks provide a critical opportunity to break an impasse that has split the country for months.
He said the goal is to "give peace back to our country and give certainty to Bolivia."
