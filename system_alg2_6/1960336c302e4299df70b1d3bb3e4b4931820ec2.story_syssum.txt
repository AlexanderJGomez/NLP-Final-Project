WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Federal and state health officials said Monday that salmonella linked last week in Minnesota to King Nut peanut butter was caused by the same strain of bacteria responsible for an ongoing outbreak of 410 salmonella cases in 43 states.
The Minnesota bacteria were linked last week to institutionally distributed peanut butter, sold under the King Nut brand name.
"King Nut took this action as soon as it was informed that salmonella had been found in an open five-pound tub of King Nut peanut butter," the company said Saturday in a posting on its Web site.
The first cases nationwide were reported September 3, but most occurred between October 1 and December 31, the CDC said last week.
Contaminated tomatoes were blamed for an outbreak in the fall of 2006 caused by salmonella Typhimurium, which sickened at least 183 people in 21 states.
Most people infected develop diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps within a few days of infection and the illness can last up to a week.
