Nearly 750 flights were affected, with 46 flight diversions, according to Gina Marie Lindsey, executive director of Los Angeles World Airports.
The airport was in the process of letting employees back into Terminals 1 and 2 around 4 p.m. PT Friday, Lindsey, said.
Some stuck in airplanes at LAX took to Twitter to document their delays, but the tone was largely respectful.
