(CNN) -- Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso fears Formula One is in danger of becoming a "lottery" and says it could lose its credibility.
We need to make clear that if you win a race, it's because you did something better.
"They seemed to work but even if we are happy now with the position and with the points we achieved, we still know and are honest with ourselves knowing that we are not quick enough at the moment still.
But as I said it's not enough, we know that and we will keep doing upgrades to the car."
"But he has the talent, he has full support from our bosses, from me, from everybody in the team and we know the talent from Felipe.
Every year in Ferrari it is like this," Alonso said.
I think we will be there.
