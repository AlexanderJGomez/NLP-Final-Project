Supporters hope Zahra Rahnavard will become Iran's future first lady.
"We look at her and we say, 'we want to be like her in the future, ' " said Shakiba Shakerhosseie, one of 12,000 people who packed into Tehran's indoor Azadi (Freedom) sports stadium to hear Rahnavard speak.
The women sat on one side; the men on the other.
"I am really angry here in Iran with the position of women," said Saghar Kouhestani, adding that she supports Mousavi because of his wife.
"This is the first time after the Revolution we see a lady behind the president," said Farhad Mahmoudi.
