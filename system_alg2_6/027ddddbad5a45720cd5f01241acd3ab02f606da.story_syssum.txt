One health care worker in Orlando began showing symptoms 72 hours after exposure to the MERS patient but did not meet criteria for admission and was sent home, said Dr. Antonio Crespo, an infectious disease specialist at Dr. P. Phillips Hospital, where the MERS patient is being treated.
The two health care workers are among 20 in the Orlando area who may have been exposed to the MERS patient, and they are being tested for the virus, officials said.
They all report that they're doing great," Michaels said.
"Before the patient came to the hospital, he was not having a cough," Crespo said.
Officials from the CDC and the Florida Department of Health are investigating the MERS case.
She said that he is not a U.S. citizen and that the Florida case is not linked to the Indiana one.
As of Friday, there have been 538 cases of MERS in 17 countries, including 145 deaths, according to the World Health Organization, Schuchat said.
Out of "an abundance of caution," the CDC has been contacting people who were passengers on the same flights as the two patients with confirmed MERS, Schuchat said.
"The patient has been doing very well," Crespo said.
