and Biggie Smalls, remains an unsolved crime despite Los Angeles police and FBI investigations that lasted for years.
The FBI opened its case in December 2002 because of "multiple source information" that Smalls was killed "in retaliation for the murder of Tupac Shakur" and that a rogue LAPD officer was involved, an FBI report said.
"Suge Knight ordered the hit," Poole says, adding that he believes it was arranged by Reggie Wright Jr., who headed security for Death Row Records.
But two months after Shakur's killing, Knight talked to ABC News and one quote seems to follow the former record company executive: "If you knew who killed Tupac, would you tell police?"
I don't get paid to tell on people."
