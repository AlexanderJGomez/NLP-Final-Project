I dialed the number and signed up with a private cord blood storage bank on the spot.
Each private cord blood bank charges different fees.
Otherwise, families are encouraged to donate their newborn's cord blood to a public bank (if accessible in the area) for free, much like donating blood or an organ; in other words, the donated unit is not reserved for the family who provided it.
