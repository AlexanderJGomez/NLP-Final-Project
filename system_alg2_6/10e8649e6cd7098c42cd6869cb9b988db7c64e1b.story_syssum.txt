When my father, an art professor at Florida A&M University, sought to pursue his doctorate in art education at Florida State University, the state of Florida chose to pay his transportation to Penn State rather than open its doors to an African-American graduate student.
Forty-four years later, in 2002, my husband and I left Massachusetts and returned to the South -- initiating our family's reverse migration.
As school districts move back to "neighborhood school" policies, white students will likely have less school contact with people of color than their parents had.
Conversely, academic performance is likely to improve if the student attends a middle-class school, even if his or her own family is poor.
Children of color in under-resourced, racially isolated schools also need these same tools.
Providing these resources equitably is a daunting task, one that has never been accomplished in the history of education in the United States.
