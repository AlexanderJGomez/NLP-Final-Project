Police say Nowsch shot Tammy Meyers, 44, in front of her home after the car he was riding in followed her home February 12.
After zipping away from the first shooting, Tammy Meyers drove home and the other car, a silver Audi, went there also.
Police said Nowsch shot at both Tammy and Brandon Meyers.
He is due in court Tuesday for a preliminary hearing.
