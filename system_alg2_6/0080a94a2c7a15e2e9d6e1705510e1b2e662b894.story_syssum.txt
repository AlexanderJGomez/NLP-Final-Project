Known as White Day, on this occasion men gift women with candy.
"Valentine's Day is one of our top five days of the year," Chul-hyun Yoo, the public relations representative for CU convenience stores, told CNN.
"You can tell what concerns women and men is different by comparing the sales of Valentine's Day and White Day," said Yoo.
Although the series of romantic days used to cater more towards couples, or those wanting to confess their secret loves using a romantic day as an excuse, in recent years, goodie-gifting on Valentine's Day and White Day has expanded to include family, co-workers and pretty much anyone you come into contact with on those days.
