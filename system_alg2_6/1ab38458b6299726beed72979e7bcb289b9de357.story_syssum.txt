(Financial Times) -- Walmart is taking a 51% stake in Yihaodian, a leading Chinese e-commerce website, in a significant move by the U.S. retailer to boost its online presence in China.
Walmart has more than 350 stores in China, where it has been making steady progress.
The company this month appointed Greg Foran, a 30-year industry veteran, as the chief executive of its China business.
