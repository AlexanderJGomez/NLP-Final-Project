There were 159 cases of measles in the United States from January 1 through August 24, according to the CDC.
Nearly two-thirds of the reported cases happened in three outbreaks in communities where many people don't vaccinate their children for religious or philosophical reasons.
According to the CDC, one to three out of every 1,000 children in the United States who get measles will die from the disease, even with the best of care.
The largest outbreak was in New York, where 58 people contracted measles in a community where many refuse to be vaccinated for religious reasons.
