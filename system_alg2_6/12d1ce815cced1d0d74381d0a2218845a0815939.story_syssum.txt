(CNN)Five young men were arrested Saturday in Melbourne, Australia, in what police called a major counterterrorism operation.
"The act that we believe was in preparation involved attacks against police officers," he said.
"I think the entire Australian community should be concerned about the young age of those particular men," Gaughan said.
In February, two men were charged with plotting terror activities in Sydney.
Australians should be stoic about the threat of terrorism, Abbott said Saturday.
Police said this particular threat had been fully contained.
