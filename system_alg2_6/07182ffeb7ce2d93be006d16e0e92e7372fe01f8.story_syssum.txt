BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Kept in a derelict warehouse at Baghdad's airport for months, sleeping four to a bed with poor food and no money, hundreds of would-be contract workers are stranded, claiming they were duped by unscrupulous recruiting agents into coming to Iraq for nonexistent jobs.
Many have questions about their visas and status in Iraq.
Some Ugandan men said the Iraqi police handcuffed and beat them.
The company said when it becomes aware of possible trafficking it works "to remediate the problem and report the matter to proper authorities.
The men in the makeshift camp said their immigration status is in limbo.
But for the stranded men, help can't come soon enough.
