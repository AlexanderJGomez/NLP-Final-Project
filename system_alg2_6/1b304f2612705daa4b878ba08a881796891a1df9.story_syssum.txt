(Sunset) -- Whether you're into lazy-day floating or rip-roaring rapids, there's a river out there for you.
We get the necessary primer before putting in: Drink lots of water, they tell us.
The river is calm, and we don't have to paddle if we don't want to.
It'll go on like this for two more nights.
Lots of wine.
Entry: My first glimpse of the Chilko is from 15,000 feet up in a tiny 10-seater plane, looking down the longest raftable stretch of continuous Class IV whitewater on the continent.
Calm water: After a paddling 101, our three rafts head out through the riffled water that the guides -- Mark, Brian and Jorge -- refer to as "calm."
We spot a chocolate-hued mother with calf and two bald eagles.
We vanish into the rapids, as the raft bends and catapults and the waves pound through us on the famous great White Mile: 12 miles of rapids in 55 minutes -- yes, that longest stretch of continuous Class IV on the continent.
At camp: Tents are pitched while the guides set up and find a scenic spot for the Groover.
Mark reads stories about spectacular Groover mishaps (picture it overturning while you're in the way).
After lunch, we take the two final, gargantuan rapids called Gaping Jaws of Death and Brains Smashed In.
And more Groover stories.
