A significant number of women, feeling not too distanced from the days when women CEOs were just a fond hope, much less an aspiration, were less than thrilled at the idea of one of the few women of real power still needing the affirmation of a Vogue fashion shoot.
Look at how pretty and sexy I am!"
But still, here's a woman who has made it to the top because of her brains, does she still need to self-validate by having a beautiful fashion gig?
I get it, and I get why she did it.
Not just a few women felt hurt looking at the Mayer layout, wondering silently or out loud if acquiescing to this kind of shot means that for Mayer, and perhaps for other women, that "making it" and "having it all" needs to include being publicly admired for one's allure.
