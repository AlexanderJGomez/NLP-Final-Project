(CNN) -- You can't escape tango in Buenos Aires.
The men would practice together to perfect their dance -- and hopefully impress the women.
Boys would sneak out to the dance halls to see the older men (brothers and fathers) dancing.
Tango is a dance that stresses elegant walking and close attention to the music.
A number of "milongas" (dance halls dedicated to tango) offer late night shows with either live music and/or authentic exhibition dancing.
The most traditional milongas place men on one side of the room and women on the other.
However, a good teacher can get you on the dance floor, walking simply and in time to the music, within a few lessons.
One of my favorites is Nuevo Chique at La Casa de Galicia.
