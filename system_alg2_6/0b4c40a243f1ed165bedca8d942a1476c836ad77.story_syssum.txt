Gwendolyn Beauregard said Fiore was a close friend of her two sons, and she met the future model when Fiore was just 11.
Interviewed from San Francisco, California, Beauregard told King all she knew about Jenkins was his initial meeting with Fiore.
Beauregard told King she's never met Ryan Jenkins.
That's, of course, where Britney Spears got married," Fleeman told King.
And the marriage had a lot of problems almost from the very beginning," Fleeman said.
I knew it was somebody who knew her and [that her killer] wanted to make sure that she was not identified," Brown said.
He is.
"Ryan Jenkins is an animal," said Robert Hasman, a family friend who said Fiore had been his girlfriend for 2 1/2 years.
Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said on "Larry King Live" that Jenkins is the only suspect.
