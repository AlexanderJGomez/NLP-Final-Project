CNN: Before Bo Xilai's trial, many commentators predicted it would follow a tight script but that doesn't appear to be the case.
Li: Bo as a person, as a leader, is unpredictable.
It will be the authorities' problem if they didn't prepare for that.
Li: Of course there would have been deals made before, otherwise the leadership would not be willing to pursue the charges.
He made a lot of people nervous about his self-promotion campaign -- that's the real reason, not about corruption.
Li: If you follow the reaction in China most people think that Bo did well, including people who really do not like him.
Some people who previously really hated him now tend to forget all the awful things he allegedly did.
Bo Xilai and his defense lawyer came across very well -- that was also a surprise, in many ways.
CNN: There was a lot of talk when the scandal emerged -- and in subsequent months -- that the case would shake-up Chinese politics.
Li: The Bo case has revealed the fundamental flaws of the political system and the widespread phenomenon of corruption and power abuse.
But the sentencing now can't be very severe because of the nature of the charges and how poorly they've conducted this trial.
