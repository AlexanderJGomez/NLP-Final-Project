He said Colombian officials will do whatever they can to guarantee journalist Romeo Langlois' release by the rebel group, commonly known as the FARC.
One statement, dated May 3 and published Sunday on a blog connected with a news agency that often publishes official statements from the FARC, criticized Langlois for wearing a military uniform and claimed that any journalists embedded with Colombian troops have been painting a biased picture.
The leftist guerrillas have been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s, and are known for holding prisoners and hostages in remote jungle camps.
Kidnapping government forces and civilians has been a key strategy of the rebel group.
Last month, the FARC released a group of 10 members of the military and police that it said were its last government hostages.
