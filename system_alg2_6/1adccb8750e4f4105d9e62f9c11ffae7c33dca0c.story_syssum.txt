Cicciaro died that night, and White was arrested.
The night Cicciaro was killed, he was at a party with the girl when they spotted Aaron White.
John and Aaron White walked out of their house, both holding guns, and had a heated exchange with Cicciaro and his friends.
Then, police say, John White shot Cicciaro at point-blank range.
White's attorneys say that racism lies at the heart of the confrontation and that John White feared Cicciaro and his friends were going to kill his son.
"The Whites, none of them, ever called 9-1-1, even after he shot Daniel, but he did call their attorney," Joanne Cicciaro added.
"I saw his blank eyes open, staring at the ceiling."
