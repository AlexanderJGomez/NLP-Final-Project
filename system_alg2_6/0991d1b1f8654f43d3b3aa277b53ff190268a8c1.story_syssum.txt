Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Members of Latin America's largest guerrilla group declared Thursday they will ask for an immediate cease fire when they meet with Colombian government negotiators for peace talks next month.
The government later said the guerrillas had used the area as a base for drug trafficking and kidnapping.
Jaramillo said a cease fire would be proposed as soon as negotiators meet next month, but the FARC is prepared to continue fighting.
"We have Simon Trinidad at the negotiating table," FARC negotiator Andres ParÃ­s said Thursday.
