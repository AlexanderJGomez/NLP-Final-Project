Biden said Operation Iraqi Freedom is over, but promised that "American engagement with Iraq will continue" with the new stability mission.
"Our fighting men and women were given a mission in Iraq that was as complicated as any in our history, an assignment that taught us that war is the realm of uncertainty," he said.
"It is time for Iraq to move forward," Odierno said.
While the U.S. combat mission is ending, roughly 50,000 American troops will remain in the country until the end of 2011 for the assistance mission.
The U.S. combat mission in Iraq officially ended at 5 p.m.
The war in Iraq has claimed the lives of more than 4,400 U.S. troops.
"Operation Iraqi Freedom is over, and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country," Obama said.
"You might recall that the surge wasn't very popular when it was announced," McConnell said.
