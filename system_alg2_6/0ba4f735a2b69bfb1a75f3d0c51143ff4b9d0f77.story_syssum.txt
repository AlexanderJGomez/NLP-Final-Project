Introduced on Wednesday, the Kindle Touch will be the first Amazon e-reader with a touch screen.
"The current technology for touch screens -- it's called capacitive touch -- is a layer that goes on top of that display.
Barnes & Noble implemented the same technology to bring touch screen capability to its Nook.
Another, Kindle Keyboard, costs $99 to $139 and looks just like its predecessor, the Kindle 3.
"We have many customers who tell us they don't want touch," Bezos reportedly said at the news conference in New York on Wednesday.
