Microsoft created a software platform called SPOT that delivered news updates to watches via FM radio waves for $59 a year.
Tablets were nothing new when Apple introduced the iPad in 2010.
It seems like the public is finally ready to accept smartwatches the way they accepted Apple's iPad.
We weren't ready for smartwatches before, but now that smartphones are so ingrained in our lives, Apple and others appear smart to give wearable tech another chance.
