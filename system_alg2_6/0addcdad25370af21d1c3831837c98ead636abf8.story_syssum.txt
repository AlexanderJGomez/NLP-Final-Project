Yang said China opposed the development and possession of nuclear weapons by any country in the Middle East, including Iran.
Yang reiterated China's diplomatic stance on Syria, which has been the subject of international criticism.
The statement calls for respect of Syrian sovereignty, delivery and distribution of humanitarian aid and support for mediation efforts by Kofi Annan, the former U.N. secretary-general who is now special joint envoy to Syria for the United Nations and the Arab League.
"China and the U.S. have more converging interests in the Asia-Pacific region than anywhere else in the world," he said.
If China were to use military force, the United States -- which does not support Taiwan independence -- could intervene under the Taiwan Relations Act, a 1979 law declaring that peace and stability in the area are in U.S. interests.
The United States, which recognizes Tibet as an autonomous region of China, has expressed concern about the situation.
