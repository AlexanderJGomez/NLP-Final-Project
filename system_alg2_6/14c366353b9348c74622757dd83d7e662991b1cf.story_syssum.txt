At a young age, soccer taught me about leadership and sportsmanship and what it means to be a good teammate.
Often, being the new girl on a team or being in a group breeds insecurities.

It's important that as women, we stand up for ourselves, stand up for our peers and show the power that confidence can have for women everywhere.
