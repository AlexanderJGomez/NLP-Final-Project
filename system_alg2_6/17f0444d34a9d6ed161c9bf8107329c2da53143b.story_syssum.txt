But another debate on immigration will refocus on internal GOP splits and raise questions about whether the party is taking any of its own advice about being more open to Hispanics.
Many Republican Party leaders and possible presidential candidates, however, say the GOP needs a more inclusive message to Hispanics if it hopes to win the White House in 2016.
A chief proponent of the House bill, Iowa Rep. Steve King, was confronted in his home state last week at an event with Sen. Rand Paul, a likely 2016 presidential candidate.
Paul has made broadening the Republican Party's appeal a cornerstone of his message.
Echoing the same sentiment expressed by Obama, Denham said the measure was "a messaging bill" and "would never see the light of day" over in the Senate.
Florida Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart also voted against that bill and told CNN that the GOP proposal helps Democrats continue to use immigration as a political wedge.
But if the message is perceived to be anti-immigrant, that is very, very negative," Diaz-Balart said.
"Republican support among Hispanic voters does not hinge on immigration reform but inaction.
Many Republicans interviewed by CNN said the challenge next year will be even greater because Democrats will want to use any divisions on the issue to further expand the wedge between the GOP and Latino voters going into the 2016 election.
But they warned that the party can't use that as an excuse to not promote a message of positive reform.
The GOP is well positioned to win control of the Senate in November, and immigration is expected to be a factor in just one key contest in Colorado, where there is a sizable number of Hispanic voters.
