We are tempted, when disputes become particularly acrimonious, to believe that the current bitterness is unprecedented.
More than 250,000 of the male veterans were said to be unemployed last month, with another 400,000 having left the workforce for various reasons: to raise children, or attend college, or because they have just stopped trying to find work.
The federal government had, in 1924, issued service certificates -- redeemable for bonuses -- to the soldiers who had returned from World War I.
They were like long-term bonds -- they could not be redeemed until 1945.
With that, the president of the United States, Herbert Hoover, fearing that radicals had infiltrated the veterans, ordered the Army to take over the involuntary evacuation.
Even though President Hoover didn't want it to happen, MacArthur sent his troops across a bridge to the site of the veterans' main living quarters.
As rugged as the economy is now -- and as difficult a time as some veterans are having as they look for work in a dismal hiring environment -- no one foresees a day when soldiers will again be ordered to roust former soldiers and their families.
If our soldiers want to work, we owe it to them to make it easier for that to happen.
