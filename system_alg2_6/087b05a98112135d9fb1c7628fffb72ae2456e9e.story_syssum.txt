(CNN) -- Belgium set a date with the U.S. in the last 16 of the World Cup as the curtain fell on the gripping group stages in Brazil, while Algeria celebrated a historic first.
Belgium's last six World Cup goals have been scored in the last 20 minutes of the match.
Algeria had arrived in Sao Paulo buoyant from a 4-2 victory over South Korea -- the North African country's first World Cup win in 32 years.
The draw was enough for Algeria to join Nigeria as the second African side in the last 16.
Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo, Spain's defending champions and 2006 winners Italy were among the big guns saying adeus from Brazil.
