Eight of the United States' 13 missile defense tests have been deemed a success.
In Friday's test, however, the target was a mock warhead and was supposed to be accompanied by "countermeasures similar to what Iran or North Korea could deploy," according to a missile defense agency official.
But the decoy that was supposed to deploy to test the system did not.
But he later said he would support missile defense systems if they work.
Last month, the outgoing head of the Missile Defense Agency said that not only are U.S. missile defenses workable, they are up and running.
