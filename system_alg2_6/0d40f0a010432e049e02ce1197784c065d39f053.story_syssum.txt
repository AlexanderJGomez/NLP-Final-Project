Such has not been the case so far with Evan Ebel, 28, the man suspected of killing Colorado prison chief Tom Clements last week.
He was an ex-con, who spent years in solitary confinement because he was deemed too great a risk to the prison community.
Ebel grew up on a quiet street in Lakewood, Colorado, near Denver.
As a teenager, Ebel was sent to a boot-camp-type program in Samoa, where according to one person who knew him there, almost everyone avoided him.
Authorities have said the bullets that killed Clements came from a gun that was found with Ebel, who had handwritten directions to the prison chief's house in his car.
According to Mangue, Ebel's life took a sharp turn after his sister's death.
Mangue and Ebel's father kept in close contact, sending letters, cards and visiting their son when they could.
The family kept her for 15 years.
Hickenlooper, Ebel was in solitary confinement for much of his sentence.
He never liked being told what to do and his time in isolation really only compacted that," Frey said.
