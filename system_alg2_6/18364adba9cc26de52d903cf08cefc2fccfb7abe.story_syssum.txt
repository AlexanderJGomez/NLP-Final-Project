Lula, 66, will be treated at Sao Paulo's Syrian-Lebanese Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Mirtes Bogea.
"He is a fighter," Mantega told reporters, adding he expected Lula will leave the hospital later Saturday.
Raul Cutait, one of the doctors treating the former president told Rede Record TV that Lula appears well.
"I am sure the same thing will happen to President Lula."
"But I hope to give to all of you a tiny bite."
