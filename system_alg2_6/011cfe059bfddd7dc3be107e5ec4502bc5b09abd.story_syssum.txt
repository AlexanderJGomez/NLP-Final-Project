Like the bespectacled character from 90s sitcom, "Family Matters," Woods freely admits to having a "nerdy side" but his attraction to Olympic skiing champion Vonn, who also described him as "funny" and "a great guy" in a recent interview, has far more to do with mutual passions.
I think that's why we get along so well," Woods said.
I couldn't practice unless I got healthy.
It's a frustration, admits Woods, after being in contention at two majors this year.
I've been there with chances to win at the weekend, I just haven't done it yet," he said.
"For Jack (Nicklaus) it took him until he was 46 ... You are going to have your years when you play really well -- you may clip two or three -- and then you have years when you just don't win anything -- you are there, you just don't happen to win," he said.
Woods may have enjoyed his most successful season since 2009, but not everyone has been pleased with his progress.
It's the first time he's seen me win a golf tournament.
Other than that, I just watch and to me that's just a thrill."
