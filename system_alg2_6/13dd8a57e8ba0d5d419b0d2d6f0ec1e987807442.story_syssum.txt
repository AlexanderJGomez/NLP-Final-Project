Jackson Irungu is quitting Kenya after being targeted for being gay.
"They have a weapon to which they defend themselves," says Pauline Kimani, a leader of an umbrella organization for gays in Kenya.
A few people defend gay rights on the streets of Nairobi.
But many say that gays shouldn't have rights, are "un-African," and not good Christians.
"They say, 'look, you are evil, the law also disagrees with you,'" says Kimani, "You are not supposed to exist within our community."
But for an openly gay man Kenyan like Irungu, progress is too slow in Kenya.
