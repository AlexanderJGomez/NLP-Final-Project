The plaintiffs in the federal suit are not African American.
"The City of Cleveland, through the other named defendants, and the other named defendants in their individual capacities, have a history of treating non-African American officers involved in the shootings of African Americans substantially harsher than African American officers," reads the lawsuit, filed Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.
The lawsuit comes on the heels of another high-profile police shooting in Cleveland.
