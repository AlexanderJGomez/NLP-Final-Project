LONDON, England -- A Colombian sculptor has created a mystery at London's Tate Modern gallery by refusing to reveal how she seemingly managed to crack open a concrete floor.
Asked how deep the crack goes, she replied: "It's bottomless.
"This sculpture has been made in the most painstaking, meticulous way by Doris and her team before it was slowly inserted into the Turbine Hall," he told the Press Association.
Serota said: "There is a crack, there is a line, and eventually there will be a scar and that scar will remain.
Salcedo said of the work: "It represents borders, the experience of immigrants, the experience of segregation, the experience of racial hatred.
