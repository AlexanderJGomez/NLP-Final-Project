In Tripoli, at the headquarters of Mellitah Oil & Gas, we meet Najmi M. Karim, the new chairman, appointed just a few days ago.
Karim says the company's facilities in the east and west of Libya suffered minimal damage in the conflict but officials in Tripoli still have not been able to establish contact with their El Feel oil field in the south where fighting still is ongoing.
For Mellitah, Karim says, getting workers back on the job is the first challenge.
At the complex, safety supervisor Abdulbaset Montaser instructs us to wear yellow safety helmets and hands us emergency masks in case of any danger.
The dock stretches two kilometers into the sea.
But the skyline is empty.
