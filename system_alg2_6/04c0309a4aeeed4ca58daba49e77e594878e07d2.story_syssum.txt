Four people were reported killed in Metro Manila, two in Central Luzon, and one in Catanduanes, the Office of Civil Defense said.
In Albay, in southern Luzon, more than 3,000 people were affected, the state-run news agency said early Wednesday.
Several areas in Metro Manila and nearby provinces were without electricity as the powerful storm cut power and transmission lines.
Dacalanio said the winds had uprooted street lights and brought down trees and road signs, but that luckily there was no flooding near his home.
