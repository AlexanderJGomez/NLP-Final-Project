But Carnival Cruise Lines said the Legend is still scheduled to head out for its next voyage on time Sunday afternoon while technicians continue working on the repairs.
In the past month, three other Carnival cruise ships have reported problems.
The Carnival Dream lost power and some toilets stopped working temporarily last week, and for a while no one was allowed to get off the vessel docked at Philipsburg, St. Maarten, in the eastern Caribbean.
The company said it was flying the more than 4,000 passengers and will give them discounts.
Once all passengers leave the ship, the Dream's crew will sail back to Port Canaveral on Sunday, the company said.
The letter also offers passengers a three-day refund and a half-price cruise in the future.
In the most publicized case, an engine room fire last month left the Carnival Triumph crippled and adrift in the Gulf of Mexico with more than 4,200 people aboard.
"We are now focused on the lessons we can learn from the incident and also what additional operational redundancies might be available," Cahill said last week.
I don't think anybody considering the cruise would be unforgiving of an unforeseen event, because those types of events occur with complex systems.
