And you can lose your job because of the FBI file inaccuracies, too.
A National Employment Law Project report found the FBI ran a record 16.9 million employment background checks -- a six-fold increase from a decade ago -- for jobs ranging from child care to truck driving, port workers to mortgage processors.
By the Justice Department's own count, roughly 50% of FBI background records are incomplete and don't include the final outcome of an arrest.
The FBI, which gathers records from the states, must provide accurate and up-to-date information when potential employers come asking for them.
If a similar system were applied to employment background checks, we estimate that 390,000 workers a year would be assisted -- able to get a job -- because of the timely, accurate information.
These bills are coming not a moment too soon.
