In addition to getting an up-close look at the launchpad, visitors can also tour the Vehicle Assembly Building and the Launch Control Center with a space expert guide.
a tour guide asks laughing guests on a bus taking them to the space center recently for one of the new tours.
NASA says Atlantis will be moved to a shuttle hanger on August 16 -- switching places with shuttle Endeavour, which will remain inside the assembly building until mid-September when it will be transported to the California Science Center in Los Angeles for permanent public display.
Control center tours visit Firing Room 4, where Apollo and shuttle managers directed launches.
It's not just one person who launches a space shuttle," said tour guide Rob English, pointing to a photo of the launch room that describes how the team works together.
Next to work spaces for the launch director and the public affairs officer are large windows overlooking the launchpad.
It's wonderful," said Steinhoff.
