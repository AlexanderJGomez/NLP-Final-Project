(CNN) -- A flood of details has emerged in the past 24 hours about the case of Ariel Castro and the three women police say he held for close to a decade inside his modest Cleveland home.
And if not, how could that be?
And when Castro and Grimilda Figueroa moved to the house on Seymour Avenue -- where the women were later discovered -- Castro wouldn't even let family members through the front door.
But in her initial interview Monday with police, Knight told investigators that she had suffered at least five miscarriages, according to the incident report obtained by CNN.
Authorities haven't concluded who, if anyone, should get the money, but are discussing it, Tomba said.
