Washington (CNN) -- The screen is black and white.
"No one had attacked anyone like that before," said Robert Mann, a Louisiana State University professor who literally wrote the book about the Daisy ad.
"The only way to do that is to make it emotional."
"It was almost like a crusade not to have Goldwater become president," said Sidney Myers, the creative director at Dane Doyle Bernbach at the time who helped make the ad.
"It was a commercial that went viral before there was a 'viral,' " said Drew Babb, an advertising creative director who teaches political ads at American University.
"That symbol of a child counting, then a voice of doom melding into the child's voice -- a great symbol to show that this is what could happen to a child."
It's a political ad for Johnson!'
"My grandmother had instilled this fear in me that I shouldn't comment to people that I'm the Daisy girl because, you know, it wasn't necessarily a good thing that I was in that ad," she said.
"I don't really like that part of it," she said.
