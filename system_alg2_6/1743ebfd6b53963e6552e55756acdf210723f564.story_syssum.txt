It's mid-morning in Brazil and Melissa, her husband Alex and their four-year-old daughter are also glued to the TV to watch their hero in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
"We met up with fans from all over; we had a guy from the UK and one guy even took a bus from Boston just to watch the race.
Racing in a global championship has helped Hamilton gain fame across international borders.
"Lewis has over three million Facebook fans -- with a third of those coming from the UK -- and he has 2.6 million Twitter followers," explained Jon Stainer, managing director of leading sports and entertainment market research company Repucom.
"Around 50% of them are from the UK but then there are a lot in Asia, Brazil and the U.S. 30,000 fans uploaded videos from 50 countries.
Here it is.
"This weekend the guy who does my website put together a collage of different clips of messages from people," he said.
Thomas, who is originally from Guyana in South America, has also been galvanizing global support for Hamilton through social media for the last five years.
Hamilton's mass appeal is not just because he's an F1 driver and now a double world champion.
"There's a crossover that appeals to many, many backgrounds," said Thomas.
He invites a whole new set of people into F1, people who might be put off by the rich, white, middle-classness of it all."
Melissa races go karts in Brazil and, although she credits her husband Alex for his practical support, she also takes heart from Hamilton.
He really loves his fans."
Thomas, like Melissa, has met Hamilton "tonnes of times" in and around grand prix weekends.
"Lewis is genuinely indebted to his fans," said Roope.
