But Schaefer realized it wouldn't be enough.
Schaefer ultimately raised more than $250,000 for the school, which was completed in 2006.
Though she'd hoped to name the school in memory of Medhine, the government -- which runs the school -- instead named it the Lidia Secondary School, telling Schaefer, "We want it to be your name so that more people [will] be like you."
Her colleagues and clients say Schaefer serves as an important reminder that people don't need money or power to make a difference.
"I've learned from Lidia that even if the project is big, if your heart is in it, you can do it."
