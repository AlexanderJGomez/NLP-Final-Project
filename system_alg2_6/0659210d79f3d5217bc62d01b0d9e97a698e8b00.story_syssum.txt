Sure, teenagers dominated the figure skating podiums at the Sochi, Olympics, but here in the United States and around the world, a growing number of skaters lacing up to compete are well into their 30s, 40s, 50s, and beyond.
"Someone dared me to skate when I was 30," Schwartz said.
This year marks the 20th anniversary of the U.S Adult Figure Skating Championships; 600 skaters are expected to compete, including 47-year-old Beth Delano.
"I fell in love with it again," said Delano.
"They come from all over the world, every continent, it is just amazing," said Schwartz, who now chairs the international competition.
"(She's) well into her 80s now, who still skates at adult nationals, and is an inspiration," said Schwartz.
