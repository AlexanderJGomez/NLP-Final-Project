(CNN) -- World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) president John Fahey has told CNN he doesn't think Novak Djokovic "has the faintest idea" what his organization does after the former world No.
Every sport can do more.
Fahey also said the fall from grace of cyclist Lance Armstrong had been the best anti-doping message since he became WADA president in 2007.
"What that said to me and the rest of the world was no matter how big you are, how tall, how successful you are, you can get caught and be dealt with.
Fahey said doping is not just a problem in successful sporting countries like Kenya and Jamaica, but rejected the notion performance-enhancing drugs were beginning to ruin sport.
