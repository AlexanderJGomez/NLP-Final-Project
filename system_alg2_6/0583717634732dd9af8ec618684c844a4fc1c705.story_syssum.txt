(CNN) -- The Syrian government is freeing some activists while arresting hundreds of others in its back-and-forth bid to placate protesters and crush dissent, a human rights lawyer said.
This is disputed by activists and eyewitnesses who told CNN that government snipers fired shots at unarmed protesters and government forces beat demonstrators.
Zaytouni said she is part of a group of lawyers that has volunteered to help defend political prisoners.
Mohammad al-Abdallah told CNN his brother was released Sunday after more than five years in prison.
