Since 9/11, jihadist terrorists have killed 25 people in the United States.
While al Qaeda and its affiliates have failed to conduct any successful attacks in the United States since 9/11, they have sought to encourage action from militant American citizens, who might be more capable of carrying out terrorist operations in the States than foreign operatives given the stringent security measures now in place.
So far, nine Americans have been charged with attempting to support or supporting ISIS or Nusra, according to a count by New America.
The role that the Muslim community has played as well as aggressive law enforcement efforts using informants have both helped to make the United States a hard target for militants.
In addition, greater public awareness of the danger posed by terrorism has also made the United States a much harder target.
