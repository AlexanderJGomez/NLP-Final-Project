MADRID, Spain (CNN)  -- A bomb inside a van exploded in northeastern Madrid Monday, after a warning call by the Basque separatist group ETA.
The attack came just hours after Spain's Supreme Court declined to allow two new leftist Basque parties to compete in the March 1 Basque regional elections in northern Spain.
The bomb, it added, was placed in a van stolen last night in the Madrid area.
