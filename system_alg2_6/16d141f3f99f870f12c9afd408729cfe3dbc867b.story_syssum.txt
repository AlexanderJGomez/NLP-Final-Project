Telling people "Happy New Year" more than a week after the first of the year is like keeping your Christmas lights up until February.
Seamon-Primas told me: "In my opinion, after the first week, I stop wishing others a Happy New Year, the new year is well on its way."
If you really care about how my year is going, ask me in October.
And when is the last time you heard a "Happy St. Patrick's Day" on March 19?
One such superstition tells us that eating poultry on New Year's Day means you will financially struggle for the coming year, which I really wish I had known before I ate chicken with mixed vegetables on January 1.
If even one custom instructed us that extended New Year's wishes would increase the chances the year would indeed be a good one, I'd be saying Happy New Year's every day until April.
