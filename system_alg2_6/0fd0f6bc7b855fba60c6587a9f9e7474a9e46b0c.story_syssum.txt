The confirmed death toll reached four when Boulder County officials recovered the body of a woman who had been swept away after getting out of her vehicle Thursday, Sheriff Joe Pelle said.
On Friday, National Guard troops using "high-profile" trucks to wade through water were evacuating the entire Boulder County town of Lyons, which had been cut off since the flooding began Wednesday night.
She said, "I just felt like I was trapped.
Four helicopters were being used for rescues in Boulder County Friday, Pelle said.
Some people remain stranded in homes there, he said, adding, "How we're going to get them out -- it's going to take a damn long time."
The National Guard effort to get residents out of Lyons began shortly after daybreak.
KMGH reporter Theresa Marchetta said evacuees also described homes dangling off cliffs.
Some people in Lyons still were awaiting rescue, evacuees said, and some residents had chosen to stay.
In the early hours Friday, flood sirens sounded in Boulder County as emergency officials feared that debris-caked canyons might give way and send another wall of water crashing through the city of Boulder and neighboring communities.
"This is not going to get fixed in a week," he said.
