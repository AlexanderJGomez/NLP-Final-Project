But his luck was about to run out in the chaos of Mogadishu, where the frontlines in the battle between the weak transitional government and al Qaeda affiliate al-Shabaab shift almost weekly.
The other man in the vehicle may also have been a senior al-Shabaab figure by the name of Musa Dheere, according to Kenyan officials.
The forged passport found in the vehicle had a recent exit stamp from South Africa, according to Somali officials.
Several of the foreign jihadists have come from the United States, with at least two (one from Minneapolis and one from Seattle) carrying out suicide bombings.
Al-Shabaab attacked Uganda because it had troops in Mogadishu as part of the African force (AMISOM) protecting the transitional government.
The United States has had some success in tracking down al Qaeda militants in Somalia -- with special forces killing Saleh Ali Nabhan two years ago.
According to intelligence sources, al-Shabaab's revenues include taxes levied at ports like Kismayu, cash from the Somali diaspora and possibly a levy on pirates' ransoms.
Two days after he was killed, Somalia's interior minister was assassinated at his home by a female suicide bomber.
