Daniel James, who played rugby for England under-16s, was paralyzed during match practice last year.
He is believed to be the youngest person from the UK to have traveled to Switzerland to commit suicide.
"This is the last way that the family wanted Dan's life to end but he was, as those who know him are aware, an intelligent, strong-willed and some say determined young man," PA reported James' parents as saying.
It is not known if James attended the clinic.
