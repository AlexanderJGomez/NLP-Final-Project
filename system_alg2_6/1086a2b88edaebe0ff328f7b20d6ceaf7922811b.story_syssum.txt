They can charge their phones on the go thanks to Strawberry Tree, the first of its kind public solar-powered charging station, installed in parks and squares across the country.
"We rely heavily on our cell phones for many essential tasks during the day," says Milisavljevic, now 26, who founded his company, Strawberry Energy, when he received the first order for his charger.
While replenishing cell phone batteries is the device's main function, Milisavljevic wants Strawberry Tree to become a core item of infrastructure in what he calls a smart, connected city of the future.
There is hardly any innovation in city living, so our dream is to bring new technology to outdoor public spaces, so we can improve the quality of life in our cities," he says.
