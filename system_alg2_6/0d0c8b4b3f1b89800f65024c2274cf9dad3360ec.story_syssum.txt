LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The first search of Michael Jackson's bedroom a day after his death found marijuana, skin-bleaching and hair-growing ointments, anti-insomnia pills and empty bottles of several anti-anxiety drugs, according to court documents unsealed Thursday.
A source with knowledge of the probe told CNN Thursday that a test later showed that a brown, sticky substance found in the search was not heroin.
Also listed on the detective's report was Benoquin ointment, a medication used to lighten skin pigmentation in people with vitiligo, a skin condition.
"His was bad because he began to get a totally speckled look over his body," Klein said.
