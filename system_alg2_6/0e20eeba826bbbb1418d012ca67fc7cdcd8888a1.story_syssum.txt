(CNN) -- Jurors who convicted a man of three murders in a 2007 Connecticut home invasion and recommended he be put to death for his crimes said Tuesday that serving on the case changed their lives -- and took an emotional and sometimes physical toll.
Prosecutors alleged Hayes and co-defendant Joshua Komisarjevsky invaded the home of Dr. William Petit on July 23, 2007, beat and tied up Petit, raped and strangled Hawke-Petit, molested one of their daughters and set the house on fire before attempting to flee.
"I have a 10-year-old daughter at home," Cardona said.
"That is burned in my memory, those pictures of those girls," Calzetta said.
Both jurors said it was hard not being able to talk about the case with their families or even each other during the trial.
Both said the jury took the case and their responsibility very seriously.
Those outside the jury room wondered why jurors took their time to decide on the death penalty, Calzetta and Cardona said -- their verdict came on the fourth day of deliberation.
Both Calzetta and Cardona said they did not buy the defense's claim that Hayes was merely a follower and KomisarjevskyCalzetta said.

Looking at the bank video of Hawke-Petit was particularly hard, she said, as jurors knew the woman was being brave and doing what she felt she had to do to save her family.
"It was a very emotional case and a very emotional two months," Cardona said.
Cardona said he was struck by the Petit family telling jurors they were sorry the panel had to go through such an experience.
