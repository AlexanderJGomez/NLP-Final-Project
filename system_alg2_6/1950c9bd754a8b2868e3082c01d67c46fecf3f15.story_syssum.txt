Police released a photo of Korena Roberts, who is charged with murder.
Roberts told deputies the baby was hers, according to the county sheriff's office.
"At this time, it has not been determined if [Snively] died because of head wounds she received or as a result of cutting injuries she received to her abdomen," said a Monday statement from the Washington County, Oregon, Sheriff's Office.
Young said an autopsy was completed on the baby, but he would not release information Monday.
Roberts' boyfriend is cooperating with police, and has not been charged in the case, authorities said.
