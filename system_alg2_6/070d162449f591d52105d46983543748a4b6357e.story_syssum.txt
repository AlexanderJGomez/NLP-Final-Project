Malik, editor Kabeer Sharma said, posed nude.
Bilawala said the publication "cheated" his client and doctored the nude pictures.
FHM, Bilawala said, violated its agreement with the Pakistani model that stipulated that Malik would be shown the photos from the shoot before they were published.
But I didn't agree to this and they are wrong.
Still, she downplayed her criticism back home.
"My fans and many Pakistanis support me and believe (in) me."
