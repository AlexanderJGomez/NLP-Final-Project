Though she was one of the most seriously hurt that day, Wright is now aiming for a spot on the British Paralympic volleyball team in 2012.
Four bombs were set off that day in July, on three subway trains and a bus.
The British Volleyball Federation announced her place on the team last month, and this week the team is competing at the 2010 Sitting Volleyball World Championships in the U.S. state of Oklahoma.
Also, sitting volleyball is played on a smaller court with a lower net.
"There were 52 people that day who were definitely worse than me, 'cause I'm still here."
