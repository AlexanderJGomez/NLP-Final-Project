Since February 2011, Rucker has run his first 5K, his first 10K, his first half-marathon and his first marathon.
"What he does after this Ironman, I don't know," his wife, Annita Rucker, said with a laugh.
Change is a funny thing, Rucker says.
"She was devastated; I was crushed," Rucker said.
The day after the 2011 Super Bowl, Rucker woke up in pain.
"Something clicked," he said.
"I did it to myself.
And no one or no thing can ever take this away from me.
"Even though I was by myself, I still had people to encourage me."
"The focus he has, the drive he has ... it's so refreshing," Annita Rucker said.
"I used to complain that he was living life on the sidelines, never participating," she said.
Some days it's really hard.
Rucker is now training for his first Ironman competition.
He's a beast, but one who feels pain.
Rucker wants to become a motivational speaker, to be that inspiration for others that Mills was for him.
"There was this little voice in my head that said, for so long, 'This is the best your life is ever going to be.'
