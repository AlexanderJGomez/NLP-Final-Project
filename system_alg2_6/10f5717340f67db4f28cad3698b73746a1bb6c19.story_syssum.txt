In other words, the country's reputation as a responsible international power, both in terms of domestic and foreign policy, is being undermined.
Based on a sample of about 3,600 people in 18 countries, it concludes that the country is "in decline," partly because of "successive fiscal crises."
These findings on the U.S.'s reputation are echoed by the 2013 BBC Country Rating Survey, which interviewed about 26,000 people in 25 countries, and also the 2013 Pew Global Study based on a sample of about 37,600 in 39 countries.
This was demonstrated, for instance, during the 2008-9 financial crisis when Congress and the administration acted more swiftly and comprehensively than many other countries to counteract the worst economic turmoil since at least the 1930s.
At the core of the current troubles is not just growing polarization between Democrats and Republicans, but significant intra-party divisions too.
Already this month, Obama has lost the opportunity to advance the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal as a result of the cancellation of his Asia trip.
This would not just further undermine the U.S.'s reputation as a responsible international power, but potentially send it into freefall again.
