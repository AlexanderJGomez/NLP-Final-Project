"It's alarming," says O'Neal.
He's now focusing his energy on preventing people from developing diabetes in the first place.
Today, the 7-foot tall O'Neal says his current weight stays around 350, "plus 10," but admits it's not easy to stay at a healthy weight and reduce his risk of developing diabetes.
In addition to raising awareness on how to prevent diabetes through a healthy lifestyle, O'Neal says he also wants to help diabetics better manage their disease.
He recently invested in a product called glucose quick sticks, which he describes as a healthier alternative for diabetics when their blood sugar is low.
