In 1959, Eintracht won its one and only Bundesliga title and went on to reach the European Cup final the following year.
While Frankfurt did reach the 1980 UEFA Cup, where it lost out to German rivals Borussia Monchengladbach, success has eluded the club in recent history.
FÃ¼rth, who was promoted from the second division alongside Frankfurt last year, has struggled so far this term.
Well, that would be the small question of a trip to the Allianz Arena to face Bayern Munich side which reached last season's Champions League Final and has won eight of its nine league games this season.
