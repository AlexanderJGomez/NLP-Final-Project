The crisis pits al-Maliki, a Shiite, against Iraqiya, a powerful political bloc that enjoys support from Sunnis and more secular Iraqis.
The bloc is one of the largest and most powerful political groups in Iraq and boasts among its members the speaker of the parliament.
They also say that the hundreds of people seized by the government in October for backing terrorism and supporting the banned Baath Party are Iraqiya supporters.
The political process is going in a very wrong direction, going toward a dictatorship," he said.
More than 4,000 Americans and an estimated 115,000 Iraqis died in the invasion and the years of insurgency and sectarian warfare that followed.
Mahmoud Othman, a Kurdish member of parliament, said lawmakers discussed the Iraqiya move on Saturday and said it reflects "a level of mistrust between the blocs, the government, Iraqiya and others.
He is worried that the problem could morph into fighting between Sunnis and Shiites or violence against the government.
