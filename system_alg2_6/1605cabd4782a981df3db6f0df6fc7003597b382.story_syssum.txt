Introduced to Australia in 1935 from Hawaii, the cane toad, which is native to Central and South America, was supposed to kill off the scarab beetles that were decimating Australian sugarcane crops.
Cane toads not only eat pretty much anything that can fit in their mouths, but as of yet, no known predators or diseases have been identified that can take them on.
Little did the Hawaiians know at the time, but the small Indian mongoose is one of the world's most fearsome killers, now listed by the World Conservation Union in the top 100 of the world's worst invaders.
But according to Cornell University, the sparrow also set about feasting on crops as well.
Just on its own the red fox could be responsible for "dozens of small mammal extinctions" in the country, according to Columbia University.
Unfortunately, the red fox was an excellent predator but it liked chasing after more types of creatures than just the brown hare.
The European red fox is often described as Australia's number one predator; and as its also a "key carrier of rabies", says Columbia, the red fox is up there amongst Australia's most unwelcome guests.
