The process of gathering these bits of biographical DNA is an attempt to form some sort of cohesive picture about what the final portrait should look like.
At a distance, Mapes' work echoes the puritanical rigidity of the Dutch Masters, but when you get up close and really examine what his sculptural paintings are made of you'll notice photographs of bare legs and bits of cleavage filling out the skin tone of the Dutch Masters' subjects.
