(CNN) -- We had a process.
Americans have discovered that a tiny, radical minority can immobilize their entire country and hold it as still as a robbery victim staring at the barrel of a pointed gun.
Any argument that the temporary closing of the U.S. federal government did not accomplish anything, in this scheme, therefore, is wrong.
The anger of the few in the minority was never supposed to be able to stop the will of the majority.
The streak of anarchy that runs through the politics of Cruz and the tea party ought to frighten sober Americans.
We might die to preserve our nation's principles but most of us won't kill our country to win an argument.
They voted in disproportionate numbers to get him into the U.S. Senate and he hopes to animate that political base across the country and ride their cheers to the GOP nomination.
Cruz has at least done us the benefit of showing us that our system functions best as a platform for campaigning and getting re-elected and not for conducting the people's business; not even the disgraced Richard Nixon created such jeopardy with his betrayal.
They like this game because now it only takes one person to storm the battlements that protect American democracy.
