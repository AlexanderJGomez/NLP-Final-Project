"There was a rumor that there were archives in the Cond√© Nast offices in New York that nobody had known about," says Todd Brandow, a photography curator.
None of the pictures had seen the light of day for eight decades, and all had been taken by the pre-eminent photographer Edward Steichen (1879-1973) for Vanity Fair and Vogue.
"Many of them were fashion pictures, but the women looked like they'd been born wearing those clothes, that they wore them every day.
Now, says William A Ewing, the third of the exhibition's co-curators, the time has come to reintroduce Steichen's work to the world.
"He turned fashion photography into portraiture.
In the early 1920s he had gone through an acrimonious divorce, and had large alimony bills that placed him in financial jeopardy.
"He went from rock bottom to being on top of the world almost overnight," says Ewing.
But Nast persuaded him that "it's not about fashion, it's about photography".
"He really was one of the greats," says Brandow.
