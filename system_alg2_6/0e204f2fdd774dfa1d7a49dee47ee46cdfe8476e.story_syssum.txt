Former President George W. Bush has a new mission: helping those with the least in Africa.
The renovated clinic opened Monday as a cervical cancer screening and treatment center, and the Bushes hope it will help save the lives of thousands of women.
The former president is aware that his legacy will be tied to the Iraq War, but he wants people to know what he is doing in Africa, too.
His legacy will last for a long time," he said of the ailing anti-apartheid icon.
Bush also initially said he wasn't bothered about his ratings in opinion polls, even if some of them now put him at a similar level to Obama.
In any case, the former president said he doesn't expect a fair assessment of his legacy in his lifetime.
