They came, as tens of thousands do each year, to harvest a highly valuable commodity from the high-altitude soil: the Himalayan caterpillar fungus -- also known as Himalayan Viagra.
(about $3).
Like many others, Ram and his brothers traveled for the harvest betting on hope alone.
Police in Dolpa expect 40,000 people to migrate to the district this year.
Thandin, who was visiting home for the harvest, remembers when the yartsa gunbu season meant local bounty, not commercial competition.
Six years ago, a committee of community leaders in Dolpa instituted a taxation system on harvesters in an effort to control numbers and ensure the local community remained resilient amidst environmental changes.
"The goal of the system was to charge people and therefore limit the number who would want to come for the harvest, but putting a price on the entry might actually be encouraging more people," he says.
"Centuries of collection indicate that caterpillar fungus is a relatively resilient resource," he says.
There is no question this Himalayan "gold rush" buoys rural economies.
