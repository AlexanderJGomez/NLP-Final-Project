According to a police affidavit unsealed last month, a ninth-grade student told investigators that Chism became visibly upset when Ritzer spoke after class on the day of the crime about his home state of Tennessee.
The video shows Chism leaving the restroom, returning later with a recycling barrel, and again leaving the restroom pulling the barrel -- this time with a black mask on his forehead, the court papers say.
Investigators said the video shows what appear to be blood stains near the bathroom and on Chism's pants.
Clothing and other belongings were scattered near the body, along with the blood-soaked gloves Chism appeared to have been wearing in the video.
Chism's mother, Diana, told investigators that she had recently moved to Massachusetts from Tennessee amid a "stressful divorce" from the teen's father.
