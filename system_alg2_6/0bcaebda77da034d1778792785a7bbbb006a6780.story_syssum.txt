Washington (CNN) -- Finding al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and rolling back a resurgent Taliban are necessary steps toward winning the war in Afghanistan, the top U.S. commander there told a Senate committee Tuesday.
Both men were called to testify about President Obama's new plan for the Afghan war, which involves the deployment of another 30,000 U.S. troops and a July 2011 date for the beginning of an American withdrawal.
One advantage U.S. troops have is that the Taliban -- which ruled most of Afghanistan before the 9/11 attacks -- remain largely unpopular among Afghans and draw support only through the threat of violence.
"The mission was refined, the ways forward were clarified, and the resources now have been committed to allow us to achieve the refined mission," said the ambassador, a retired general who held a senior post in Kabul before retiring from the Army.
"I believe we will absolutely be successful," McChrystal responded when the committee chairman, Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Missouri, asked the general point-blank about the chances for success of the U.S. mission.
I don't believe it is a deadline at all," he told lawmakers, later adding that he assumed a U.S. troop withdrawal will begin at that time.
At present, 68,000 U.S. troops are operating under both NATO and U.S. commands in Afghanistan, and around 42,000 non-U.S. forces are under NATO.
