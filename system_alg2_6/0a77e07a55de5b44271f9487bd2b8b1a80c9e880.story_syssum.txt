"We've said all along, we'll wait for the votes to be counted," Murkowski Campaign Manager Kevin Sweeney told CNN.
Currently, Alaska's Division of Elections is counting 100,868 votes for Murkowski versus 90,448 for Miller.
If the outcome stands in the face of legal challenges, despite a count of any outstanding ballots or a potential recount from Miller, it would be only the second time a person won a write-in campaign for the Senate.
As Alaska's Division of Elections tallied them, some ballots that contained misspellings or variations of "Lisa Murkowski" have been credited as votes for her.
Palin endorsed Miller over Murkowski for the state's GOP Senate primary, and the national Tea Party group followed suit.
