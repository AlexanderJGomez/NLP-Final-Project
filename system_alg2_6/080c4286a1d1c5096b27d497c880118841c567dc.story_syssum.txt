Frank -- who left Brown after one year in the late 1930s because he couldn't afford to stay -- gave the school a $100 million endowment in 2004.
"I sat in this guy's office ... and he said, '$37,000 for tuition,' " Reil recalled.

The school intends to give 30 to 35 Frank scholarships per year.
Most recipients are the first in their families to go to college, Miller said.
