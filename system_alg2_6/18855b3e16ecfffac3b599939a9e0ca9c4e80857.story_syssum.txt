(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton is front-page news again.
-- It's Hillary.
-- The media love Hillary and are not-so-subtly rooting for her to run.
-- Clinton hasn't made up her mind.
(See?!)
Hillary Clinton is incredibly popular right now in part because she's had diplomatic immunity for the past four years.
She blew a 30-point lead to a freshman senator, allowed massive staff infighting and failed to fully compete in the caucus states.
The political press will plow this ground again and again until the former first lady makes up her mind.
