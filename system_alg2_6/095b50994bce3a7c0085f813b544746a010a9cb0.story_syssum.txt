Chris Christie built his keynote address to the Republican National Convention on the theme of telling tough truths to the nation.
No wonder Christie omitted "New Jersey Comeback" from his keynote address.
Most important, from a political perspective, Christie had a smooth launch onto the national stage, talking more about Chris Christie -- much more -- than about the man of the hour, candidate Mitt Romney.
Though Obama called Kerry's name 13 times in that speech, Christie mentioned Romney only seven times.
But if he hopes to repeat any version of Obama's astounding leap from keynote to candidate, he'll have to get New Jersey's fiscal house in order pronto.
