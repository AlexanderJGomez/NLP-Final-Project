(CNN) -- Residents of large swaths of central and Southern California and Arizona shivered Saturday as plummeting temperatures prompted freeze warnings.
The East Coast is enjoying a ridge of high pressure that has provided a dome of warm air, said Atlanta NWS forecaster Keith Stellman.
According to CNN affiliate KCAL, freeze warnings were expected to be in effect through 9 a.m. Sunday for most of Southern California, with a freeze watch posted for Sunday night through Monday morning.
Overnight freezing temperatures will continue through Tuesday.
Fire officials said homeowners set up a heat lamp and blankets on their back patio.
