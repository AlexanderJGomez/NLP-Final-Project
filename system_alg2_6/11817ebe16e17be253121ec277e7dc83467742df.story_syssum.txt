(CNN) -- Tom Wagner woke up Friday night and the plane cabin was dark.
I'm locked in the plane."
Wagner said he walked around the plane in the dark trying to figure out the best thing to do.
The flight was operated by ExpressJet, a United partner.
ExpressJet told CNN affiliate KTRK there was a post-flight cabin inspection, but the company couldn't explain how Wagner was overlooked.
