Marion Christopher Barry, the 34-year-old son of Marion Barry, the iconic former D.C. mayor and council member who died last year, is running for his father's seat on the district's council.
Barry was convicted of possession and served six months in prison.
After leaving the mayor's office, the older Barry was elected to the council of the District of Columbia where he served until his death.
