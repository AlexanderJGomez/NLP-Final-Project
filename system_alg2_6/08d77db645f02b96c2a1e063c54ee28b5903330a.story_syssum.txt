(CNN) -- Attorneys for a Guantanamo Bay detainee on a hunger strike say a U.S. military nurse has refused to conduct forced feedings of inmates.
The matter is in the hands of the individual's leadership.
Crider said it was believed to be the first time one of the U.S. medical personnel has refused to carry out the feeding regimen.
Supporters of Dhiab say he is among more than 40 men who at one time in the past few years were being forced fed.
"The court is in no position to make the complex medical decisions necessary to keep Mr. Dhiab alive," said Judge Gladys Kessler.
Kessler also ordered the Obama administration to release 34 video recordings of Dhiab being forced-fed, as well as the detainee's medical records.
