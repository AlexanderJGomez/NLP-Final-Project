The Federal Trade Commission is urging mobile phone app developers and phone companies to make it easier for parents to control the personal information being collected by smartphone apps.
"Our study shows that kids' apps siphon an alarming amount of information from mobile devices without disclosing this fact to parents," said FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz in a statement released with Monday's report.
The agency urged developers and marketers to work together and develop accurate privacy disclosures regarding what data is collected through apps used by kids.
