Sara is a 115-pound federally protected loggerhead sea turtle who, if not for sheer luck, would be dead today.
"Everyone in the Keys was absolutely offended that someone would come down and do that to one of our turtles," Moretti said.
He said he does not believe whoever shot the turtle was from the Keys.
After stabilizing Sara and giving her antibiotics, Mader was able to remove the spear from her head and the flutter ended.
It's even rarer for a turtle to survive and recover so quickly from the kind of damage Sara suffered.
