(CNN) -- Many a modern president has lost momentum and suffered what are termed "scandals" in his second term.
One partial exception was foreign policy, where the inherent powers of the commander-in-chief give the president somewhat more constitutional leeway than in domestic policy.
For example, during his first term, Woodrow Wilson made every effort to stay out of World War I, and he won re-election in 1916 on that promise.
The current "scandals" certainly are expensive to Obama in terms of daily distraction and lost political momentum, but if you think you can write off the rest of the Obama presidency, think again.
The lessons of history tell us: It is too soon to write off Barack Obama.
