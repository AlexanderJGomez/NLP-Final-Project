BAE said Thursday it is working with American Airlines to put laser systems on the planes, which will be flying between New York and California.
Homeland Security officials say there is no specific threat of these weapons -- also known as MANPADS, for Man-Portable Air Defense Systems --  being fired at planes.
A chief goal of the testing program is to discover how to increase the systems' endurance.
Last year, American and BAE installed and test flew BAE's hardware on a Boeing 767 that was not in commercial service, Hotard said.
