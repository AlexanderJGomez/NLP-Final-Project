And I said, 'I love you,'" Lane recalled.
The small plane carrying Sierra back home from vacation crashed Friday in western Kentucky.
Lane said the loss has taught her a powerful lesson that she hoped other people would take away from the disaster.
"That's what all her friends are saying at school -- they thought they had so much time with her, just like we did.
The other family members who died in the plane crash were Sierra's uncle and aunt, Marty and Kimberly Gutzler, and Piper, their 9-year-old daughter.
And everyone knew him," Collins told CNN affiliate KFVS.
Kimberly Gutzler, 46, "loved her animals, traveling, painting and spending time with her family," according to her obituary.
"And all of them are telling everyone to 'fly high.'"
