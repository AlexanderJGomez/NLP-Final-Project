Chaifetz posted the recording online Monday, which has since led to disciplinary actions, including the removal of at least one teacher, school officials said.
Chaifetz said he reached out to school officials to report the alleged actions of the teacher and her aides.
It was unlike his son to misbehave and hit his teachers, Chaifetz said, though he had difficulty getting answers from Akian because he struggles with speaking.
School officials said they would not comment on personnel issues.
