Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- We had not been in Port-au-Prince in a month, not since those horrible days following the earthquake when the city looked like wreckage.
"When is it going to end?"
All day, staff members of Maison surveyed the damage to their community.
That day, women from the ravine had come escorting children who'd been washed with soap and rain water.
No one had eaten fresh food in a week, and the Maison staff brought baby formula and rice.
A missionary worried aloud about a newborn wrapped in plastic whose parents had no formula for the baby's first five days.
No immediate reports of damage were made, but the aftershock sent frightened people once again out into the bug-filled night.
People sleeping outside now feel threatened by the rains, but sleeping inside carries the threat of the seemingly never-ending aftershocks.
