The research was presented at the recent Population Association of America meeting.
That means there are black, white, even Asian Hispanics.
So Hispanics can be at once a race and not a race.
This suggests that the way Americans say "upward mobility for immigrants" or "mainstream integration" is still too often "becoming white."
In more recent times, Asian Americans who've achieved in visible ways have been granted "honorary white" status (wanted or not), while some people of color seeking middle-class success have been accused by their co-ethnics of "acting white" (whether they thought of it that way or not).
They're not becoming white.
Correction: An earlier version of this article misidentified the source of the new research reported on by Pew.
