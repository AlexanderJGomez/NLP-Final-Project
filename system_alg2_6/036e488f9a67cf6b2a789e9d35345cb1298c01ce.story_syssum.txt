(CNN) -- Iran has threatened that it will retaliate against the Obama administration's proposed new economic sanctions on Iran's oil exports by blocking the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf.
It is for this reason that Iran is treating the proposed new sanctions as an act of war, and is issuing threats of its own to dissuade the United States from going through with the new sanctions.
But it is not clear whether Saudi Arabia actually would increase production to compensate for the loss of Iranian oil.
Economies from India to China would be impacted by a Persian Gulf oil cutoff and higher energy prices.
Iran hopes its saber-rattling will persuade Asia's economic powerhouses and Persian Gulf emirates to pressure Washington to back away from the new sanctions.
