The world may be watching the U.S. election, but China isn't concerned with who wins.
Chinese intellectuals, and indeed the public at large, believe that no matter who wins the race, America will have to be soft in its approach to our country because there is so much at stake.
While the Chinese people desire democracy, they are skeptical of the U.S. system because its elections don't seem to engender progress for Americans.
Here the public knows very little about who their politicians are, the decisions they have made and what they believe in.
The one-party system in China is inhuman.
But while China desires to understand the world, it fails to accept its universal values.
In other words, regardless of your location, social background or political system, it is never easy to speak up against authorities -- it requires a lot of skill and persistence.
