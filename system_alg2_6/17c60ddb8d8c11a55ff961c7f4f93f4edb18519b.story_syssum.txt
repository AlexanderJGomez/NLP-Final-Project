New York (CNN) -- She may be out of Washington and on the road for the week, but the heavy machinery of office has followed Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to New York as she attends the annual United Nations General Assembly meetings.
Marshall's office is responsible for advising on matters of international diplomatic protocol, making sure the right atmosphere is created for conducting diplomacy.
Despite the enormity of the task at hand, some of his staff was already at work preparing for next year's UNGA.
A separate staff works on the 34th floor, preparing the room where Clinton would be meeting with the Japanese and Russian foreign ministers, and the pool of reporters who would shuffle in to ask questions and take pictures of the two shaking hands.
It's not just shuffling the press into a room: Boggs spends months advancing the site, making sure the media gets a good shot to illustrate the diplomacy secretaries of state are conducting.
Lee is well-known for his tough questions, but he says he wouldn't be doing his job if he didn't push the State Department to explain how all the meetings here at UNGA translate in to U.S. foreign policy.
When Clinton leaves the secure lines will be removed and the sensitive documents destroyed, and a new set of guests will take their place.
