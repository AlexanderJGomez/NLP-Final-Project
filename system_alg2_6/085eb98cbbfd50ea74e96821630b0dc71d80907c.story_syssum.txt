Naturally, of course, I was present, showing up casually late because it's what awesome people do at epic parties.
OK, so maybe it's not Ibiza, but there was a popular online party hosted by the CVS Beauty Club to promote the pharmacy's cosmetic offerings via social media.

CVS really managed to get people talking about and participating in their virtual Twitter party, which is pretty amazing.
And now I have to fold the laundry ... and do other stuff because I'm home alone with my computer ... drinking ... from a keg.
Personally speaking, the most appealing aspect of a digital Twitter party is that I only have 140 characters to completely embarrass myself.
But let's get back to this beauty club.
I'm all about discounts and Twitter parties and Beano and maybe even a touch of mascara when I'm feeling pretty, but I'm not exactly sure this is qualifies as a "club."
And technically, I suppose, even Nick Nolte could join.
