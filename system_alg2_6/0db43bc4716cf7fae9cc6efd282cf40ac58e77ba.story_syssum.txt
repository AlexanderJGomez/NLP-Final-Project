LONDON, England (CNN) -- Campaigners in London planned to petition the British government Friday for a posthumous pardon for the hundreds of people executed for witchcraft between the 16th and 18th centuries.
Around 400 people were executed in England and some 4,000 in Scotland for alleged witchcraft, campaigners say.
Hopkins made Lowes walk for days and nights until he was unable to resistconfessing to being a witch.
"A lot of these cases were score-settling in local communities," Webb said, adding many cases of alleged witchcraft weren't even reported.
In its ruling, the court pardoned both the accused witches and their cats who, it said, were executed for "conjuration or sorcery."
Webb said while few people today may believe those men and women deserved execution, their stories still generate suspicion and stigma.
"To receive a royal pardon, the test is a high one," the spokesman said.
Jane Swift cleared the remaining five in 2001, she said.
