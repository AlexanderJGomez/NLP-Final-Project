Meanwhile, opposition groups maintain the construction of the parliament has been shrouded in secrecy and at least $45.3 million in public funds has been allocated for the project in a 'totally non-transparent' manner, according to a report by the Tbilisi-based legal advocacy group, Georgian Young Lawyers' Association (GYLA), released in April.
