One day after the Gulf Cooperation Council released a statement urging Yemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh to transfer powers to his vice president, thousands of protestors returned to the streets Monday for marches and opposition leaders are vowing not to back down.
"The opposition is now the one going against the GCC initiative," said Ganadi.
"No initiative will save Saleh from the crimes he committed against the peaceful youth," Anesi said.
Despite increasing pressure from neighboring countries and opposition groups, the Yemeni government has said calling for Saleh's departure now is going too far.
"We will not differ with the revolution youth and we will support them," Yahya Abu Osbaa, a senior JMP official said.
"In the end, I can assure you that we will agree on terms," Osbaa said.
