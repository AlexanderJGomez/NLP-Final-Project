Keith Matthew Maupin, was captured by insurgents in April 2004.
His father, Keith Maupin, said military officials informed the family Sunday afternoon that the remains of the 24-year-old Army reservist had been identified.
Maupin, who was 20 at the time of his capture, and another soldier, Sgt.
Krause's body was found two weeks later.
The news about Maupin came Sunday as roadside bombings in northern and western Iraq killed two U.S. troops and attacks on Iraqi police and others left another 19 dead, Iraqi police and U.S. military officials reported.
The latest attacks bring the U.S. death toll in the five-year-old war to 4,009.
