"I've instructed my attorney to sue Rita Cosby, the publisher and any source that spits out some of that false, defamatory information that's in there," Birkhead said Tuesday on CNN's "Larry King Live."
Birkhead said Cosby's sources on the Stern allegations were two maids, whose reliability is questionable, and Jackie Hatten, a woman who claims to be a friend of Smith's -- and who, according to the book, says she is the one who walked in on Stern and Birkhead.
Her death sparked a legal battle between Stern and Birkhead over the paternity and custody of her infant daughter, Dannielynn.
Ron Rale, a former Smith attorney and a friend of Stern's, told "Larry King Live" Stern would "absolutely" join in the suit against Cosby.
Birkhead told CNN Cosby never called him to verify the allegations or told him she was writing a book.
