"The media attention to protests in Delhi has raised awareness on issues of violence against women in Nepal," said Manju Gurung, of Pourakhi, an organization that advocates for female migrant workers.
Their outrage focused on several cases of alleged rape and abuse against women, including that of the migrant worker, whom they refer to as Sita Rai.
On November 18, the woman returned home to Nepal on vacation from Saudi Arabia, where she works as a domestic worker, said Basanta Bahadur Basnet, a lawyer who represents the woman.
Parsuram Basnet has been suspended from his job as a police officer at the airport, but he cannot be removed from his job until the verdict, said Dhiraj Pratap Shingh, a spokesman for Kathmandu District Police.
Why would she file a case a month later otherwise," the defense attorney said.
