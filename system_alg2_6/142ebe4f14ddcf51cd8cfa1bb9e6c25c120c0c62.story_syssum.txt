(CNN) -- For the first time since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Christine Wilford plans do something remarkable on Thursday that once was routine: drop her child off at school.
Newtown Public Schools Superintendent Janet Robinson said that part of the building had been transformed to resemble an elementary school.
"I think right now it has to be the safest school in America," Monroe Police Lt. Keith White said.
