(CNN) -- More than 500 veterans in Ohio are being contacted by a clinic where they may have been exposed to hepatitis and HIV during routine dental work, according to Ohio Veterans Affairs communications officer Todd Sledge.
Veterans could still receive care at other facilities, Sledge said.
The center is taking an "ongoing in-depth look at a lot of aspects surrounding the allegations," Sledge said.
