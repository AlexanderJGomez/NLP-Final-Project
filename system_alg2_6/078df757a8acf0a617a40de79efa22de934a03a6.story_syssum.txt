Thursday's meeting with emerging economies including China also secured a commitment from the developing countries to work for limiting global warming to the 2 degree Celsius threshold, Obama said.
Obama said the emerging economies agreed to work toward setting specific targets.
Obama said the G-8 targets and work with developing countries are intended to support the international climate change treaty that will succeed the Kyoto Protocol in 2012.
The Forum nations account for 80 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions.
Todd Stern, Obama's special envoy for climate change, noted that China and other emerging economies had never previously acknowledged the 2-degree Celsius threshold or committed to reducing emissions from current levels.
However, Stern said the 2-degree threshold was the "underpinning" of the global goal for an overall 50 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, including the 80 percent cuts targeted by the G-8 countries.
Obama's father was a native of Kenya.
