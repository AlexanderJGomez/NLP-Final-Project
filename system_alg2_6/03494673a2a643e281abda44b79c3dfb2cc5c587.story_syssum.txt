The announcement came as the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs predicted that 3.45 million inside Syria could have crossed its borders by the end of the year and another 6.8 million people remaining inside Syria will need aid.
Two days after Syrian government forces seized control of the strategically important city of Qusayr from rebel forces it describes as "terrorists," the army sought to restore security and stability to surrounding villages, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported Friday.
The announcement came amid fighting over the Quneitra crossing, Syria's only access point to the Golan Heights.
U.N. spokeswoman Josephine Guerrero said Filipino and Indian peacekeepers will remain in the region to enforce the peace deal between Israel and Syria reached in 1974, nearly seven years after Israel first captured Quneitra in the Six-Day War.
