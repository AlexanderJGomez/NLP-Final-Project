This understated entrance marked an extraordinary moment for the kingdom and for the Olympics itself, as the first occasion in the history of the Games when all countries participating have had women athletes in their teams.
Women boxers made history by being included in the games for the first time, and the U.S.'s gymnastics team won a brace of medals for their remarkable performance.
Eight women badminton players from China, Indonesia and South Korea were disqualified for trying deliberately to lose matches in order to secure easier games.
Despite such media storms, overall many sensed a shift in the right direction, a sea change in attitudes towards women in competitive sports.
"It was the opportunity of a lifetime."
