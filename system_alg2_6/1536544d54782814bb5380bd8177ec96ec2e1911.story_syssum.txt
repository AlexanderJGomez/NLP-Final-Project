(CNN) -- Small waves lap at the hulls of the ocean-going container ships as they approach the South African Port of Ngqura.
"We started off in October 2010 ... and from there on it's grown -- from one ship a week, sometimes we do between five and 10 ships a day now," he continues.
And it's not just the port that is seeing growth in the area.
"The Coega industrial development zone has a very important role to play in the economic growth of the area," says Christopher Mashigo, business development executive manager at the Coega Development Corporation.
As well as individuals gaining skills and jobs, small and medium size businesses in the area are also benefiting from the zone.
"Up to this far even other companies, they're flocking to the Eastern Cape and mainly because Coega is heading most of the projects here in the Eastern Cape and then it has helped our business to grow as well.
As the port expands, watery waves will continue lapping at the ship's hulls and businesses hope they will see continued waves of growth in the local economy.
