Since 2008, his organization's Political Party Time website has been tracking exclusive, behind-the-scenes events where politicians and special interests meet, often out of the spotlight.
Tonight Steiner decides to stop by Planned Parenthood Political Action Fund's "Sex, Politics, and Cocktails" party first.
"There is a real transparency issue here," Steiner says.
A woman clutching one of the "We love Michelle" banners that had been handed out on the convention floor earlier in the evening keeps knocking it into people as she joyfully dances "The Electric Slide."
"This party seems like a way to drum up enthusiasm with the base," Steiner says, as he makes his way to the bar to talk with someone he knows.
"The Democrats have clearly decided their work for women is a winning issue for them, and Pelosi is a rock star among the Democratic base," Steiner says.
Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University who was in Charlotte to observe the convention, says parties such as this energize the base on particular issues.
Steiner says there were several splashy events at the RNC.
The lobby has a different feel than the Planned Parenthood party.
Steiner says he noticed their names on a giant screen next to the dance floor.
"That type of corporate sponsorship may suggest they have more influence than others with politicians, and some may take issue with it, but groups don't have the money to do this on their own and they want to attract the right people to their events.
Instead, he talks to people and takes notes.
"These conventions are supposed to be merely ... events to rally for these candidates," Holman says.
It's past 1 a.m. when Steiner leaves the party and heads off to another.
