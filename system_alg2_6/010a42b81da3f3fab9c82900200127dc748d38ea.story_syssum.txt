The Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery Project (LOIRP) has since 2007 brought some 2,000 pictures back from 1,500 analog data tapes.
Between 1966 and '67, five Lunar Orbiters snapped pictures onto 70mm film from about 30 miles above the moon.
The satellites were sent mainly to scout potential landing sites for manned moon missions.
These didn't.
Several abortive attempts were made to recover data from the tapes, which were well kept, but it wasn't until 2005 that NASA engineer Keith Cowing and space entrepreneur Dennis Wingo were able to bring the materials and the technical know how together.
"We're both Apollo babies, so the moon to us was something that's unfinished business," says Cowing.
"We're the first people out of a generation or more to see this," says Cowing.
"A lot of the images they're taking today, our imagery from 1966 and '67 has sometimes greater resolution and greater dynamic range because of the way the pictures were taken.
The seven or so people tinkering away inside maintain an open-source mentality about their work, making all images and their technological discoveries free to the public.
"The surplus folks at NASA Ames where all the old computers and stuff go, they love us because we come over and make all the old stuff work.
Started by the same Nancy Evans that provided the tape drives, the Planetary Data System didn't exist when the Lunar Orbiter pictures were initially taken.
"We feel that we're completing the Lunar Orbiter 1 through 5 missions.
