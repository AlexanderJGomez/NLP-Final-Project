LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Katherine Jackson's legal battle for some control of her son's estate returns to court Monday in front of the same judge who is expected to award her permanent guardianship of Michael Jackson's children.
"Such measures will not be necessary if Mrs. Jackson is appointed a co-executor of the estate," McMillan said.
The judge is also expected Monday to finalize Katherine Jackson's guardianship of her son's three children.
The couple divorced in 1999 with Rowe giving Jackson full custody while she got an $8.5 million settlement, according to court documents.
Metzger, who practices in West Hollywood, California, told Jackson during a visit to his Holmby Hills home that the drug was "dangerous and potentially life-threatening and could not be used outside of a hospital," attorney Harland Braun said.
He said Metzger prescribed drugs for Jackson under the alias Omar Arnold and Michael Jackson, which was not illegal since he used both names together.
Dr. Deepak Chopra told CNN in a recent interview that when Jackson asked him for a narcotic, he told him absolutely no.
During the meeting, it was decided that an announcement of the coroner's findings would be delayed indefinitely, according to a source close to the investigation.
