Washington (CNN) -- The Secret Service has yanked the security clearances of 11 members accused of bringing prostitutes to a hotel in Colombia ahead of last week's pan-American summit, government officials with knowledge of the investigation said Monday.
Rep. Peter King, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, told CNN that he believed 11 prostitutes were brought back to the hotel.
Rep. Darrell Issa, the chairman of the House Oversight and Investigations Committee, said he met with Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan on Monday and said Sullivan was "shocked" by the accusations.
"We're representing the people of the United States, and when we travel to another country, I expect us to observe the highest standards," he said.
The Pentagon said Monday that the misconduct involved more service members than the five initially believed.
Little said the personnel were not directly involved in presidential security and did not have any contact with Obama.
Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan said the agents were relieved of duty Thursday, before the president's arrival in Colombia.
