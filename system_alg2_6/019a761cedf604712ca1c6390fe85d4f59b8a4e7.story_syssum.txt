Just three weeks ago, Fowle -- like his fellow Americans, Bae and Miller -- was detained in North Korea.
No more.
Euna Lee, who was released from North Korea in 2009 after being detained for 140 days, said she wanted to return not just to her home, but to normal.
Numerous Americans have been detained over the years in North Korea, though that's not to say that they've all had identical experiences.
While also accused of "perpetrating hostile acts," and while he -- like Bae and Miller -- told CNN he signed documents admitting his guilt, Fowle said he didn't spend time in a jail or at a labor camp.
Fowle said that his transition home was eased by the fact he got his old job back home in Ohio.
Still, he believes that both Bae and Miller -- if they can survive months detained in North Korea -- can survive and thrive in their return home as well.
