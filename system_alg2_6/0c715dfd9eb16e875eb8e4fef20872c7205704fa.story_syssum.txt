Tokyo (CNN) -- The light bulb above our dining room table begins to swing.
A few seconds later the floor begins to buck.
Then a buzzer sounds and an instructor comes into the room.
The Tokyo Earthquake Simulation Center is located on the fourth floor of the city's Ikebukuro Bosai-kan fire station.
"Residents of Tokyo are required to attend courses to enhance their disaster preparedness awareness," says my instructor.
The Lisbon quake -- which killed at least 60,000 people -- was so powerful that the water in Loch Lomond in Scotland oscillated for two minutes.
A serious earthquake with accompanying aftershocks is simulated every half hour every day except weekends and Tuesdays at Tokyo's Life Safety Learning center.
One percent of the city's houses were destroyed and 700,000 homes were burned down.
The shock started a tsunami tidal wave that reached a height of 36 feet at Atami on Sagama Bay, where it destroyed a further 150 houses and killed 60 more people.
Students learn how to protect themselves and prevent fires from spreading after an earthquake.
Not because they want to learn more.
Would you like to enjoy another one yourself?"
Grabbing a cushion I find safety under the kitchen table.
"But it won't be so much fun," my earthquake examiner says.
