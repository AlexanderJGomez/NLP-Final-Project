The captain of a ship at sea is one of the last bastions of total authority in this world.
He is given extraordinary training for the challenges of the waters he is in and the vessel he is commanding.
The captain of a cruise ship, whose sole mission is the safe transport of your passengers, has no excuse to choose anything but the safest path.
Third, his personal decision to leave the vessel before his passengers had safely embarked from the ship shows a flagrant disrespect for his ultimate responsibilities as a sea captain.
But even before it gets under way, one thing is clear: the training and promotion process that put a man like this in command of a passenger ship missed the character flaw that allowed him to jeopardize his vessel for some apparently transient and empty purpose.
I just did my duty, the duty of a sea captain," he said.
