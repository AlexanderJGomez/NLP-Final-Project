For Father's Day, my wife gave me some boxer shorts and a tiny reading light, so I can flip through a book in bed without disturbing her.
Why?
), and I would have to tackle Herculean tasks like giving baths, changing all of the diapers, putting them both to bed, and even giving medicine to Lorelei, who had an ear infection.
If this were 1897 or even 1974, I could have coasted through the weekend, serving potato chips and cold cereal to Isabelle, and I would have brought the girls to my wife's bed for her to do the changing of the diapers.
We not only love our children, we're acutely aware that we have a responsibility to be the best parents we can be.
I grew more confident in my parenting skills and even gave both girls a bath -- at the same time -- not once, but two nights in a row!
Even full-time working moms do more child-rearing than us dads, studies have repeatedly found.
Yet I think we dads merit at least a little more than boxer shorts, soap-on-a-rope, and neckties.
Just as much as the moms, we appreciate the cards, the praise, and being treated special on our day.
