Washington (CNN) -- When President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, it was clear he would face an uphill battle defending the law and communicating its benefits to the American public.
Less than half understood that health reform would allow for them to receive preventive care services without having to pay anything.
But health care reform will not be repealed, and despite messy politics and angry voices, policymakers, providers, insurance companies and other stakeholders are moving quickly to implement the bill.
But more importantly, a repeal of health care reform, followed by a replacement with a more modest set of changes, is tantamount to leaving millions of patients in a state of free fall, with no net to catch them.
From there, adults and seniors will no longer have cost-sharing provisions for preventive services.
Keep in mind that some of these provisions will not technically kick in until your health plan starts the new plan year, which usually happens in January.
As patients, we should ask questions and not be afraid to challenge our health care system, insurance companies and government officials when we are left feeling confused or misguided.
