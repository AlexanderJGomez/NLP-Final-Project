Los Angeles (CNN) -- A drug addiction expert who testified that Michael Jackson suffered a "quite extensive" drug addiction acknowledged there was no evidence the singer used more painkillers than medically necessary.
Jackson's drugs of choice were opioids, painkillers given to him by doctors repairing scalp injuries suffered in a fire and during cosmetic procedures to make him look younger, Levounis testified.
The judge would not allow Levounis to testify if he thought Jackson was addicted to propofol.
There was also no evidence Jackson used more painkillers than doctors prescribed, he said.
Levounis acknowledged in testimony Wednesday that there was evidence that Gongaware knew about Jackson's painkiller addiction 15 years before his death.
Murray's notes did show he treated Jackson's complaints of insomnia with a sedative in 2008.
