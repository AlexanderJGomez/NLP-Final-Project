Relisha Rudd has been missing since March 1, when she was last seen with Kahlil Tatum, a 51-year-old janitor at the homeless shelter where Relisha lived.
Lanier said Relisha was not with Tatum in any of those sightings.
The possible discovery of Tatum's body will not end the search for Relisha, according to Lanier.
That search is continuing."
