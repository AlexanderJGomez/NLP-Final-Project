The Red Alert app co-created by Ari Sprung, an Israeli software developer born in the United States, has become increasingly popular as the conflict escalates.
Red Alert receives notifications when rockets are being launched from Gaza, and automatically sends out a push notification to users via the downloaded app.
Once the app is downloaded, users can select which Israeli cities for which they want to get alerts.
"I know if it hits they won't be able to contact me immediately, so I want to be able to know to get in touch with them to make sure they're OK."
The time it takes for Israeli's to seek shelter varies, based on how far they are from the Gaza border.
