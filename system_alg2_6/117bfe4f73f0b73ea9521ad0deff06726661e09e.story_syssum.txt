Sarah Palin, Wasilla, Alaska's former mayor, is under fire for a sports complex she fought hard for.
"When they started building, the title to the land was in my name," said Lundgren, who now lives in Panama.
In 1999, the Nature Conservancy was negotiating to sell the land to the city and Lundgren, but he says that although he signed a purchase agreement with the group, the city did not.
After Palin left office, the city sought to obtain the tract it needed for the sports complex through eminent domain, leading to another court battle.
Palin's successor as mayor, Diane Keller, said the project has brought in more than $3 million in revenue for local businesses.
It may have been a part of Sarah Palin's dream, but it wasn't only her dream," Keller said.
