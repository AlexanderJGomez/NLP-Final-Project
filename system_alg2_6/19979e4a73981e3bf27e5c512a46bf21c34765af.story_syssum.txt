Sergio Aguero's second half strike was enough to give Manchester City a closely fought 1-0 victory over a Manchester United side that played the majority of this tense match with ten men after Chris Smalling was sent off late in the first period.
Pellegrini's men have struggled in recent weeks, losing to Newcastle United and West Ham in domestic competitions whilst drawing with CSKA Moscow in the Champions League.
City's recent dominance in this fixture now makes the big spending "noisy neighbors" accusation once leveled by former United manager Alex Ferguson seem a long time ago.
Gael Clichy was expertly played through by Yaya Toure before cutting the ball back for Aguero to sweep the ball high beyond De Gea.
City still created chances of their own, however.
