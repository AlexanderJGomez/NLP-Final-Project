Erika Murray was arraigned September 12 on a bevy of charges stemming from the discovery of the dead infants at her home the day before, but she has not been charged in their deaths.
Rivera also "presumably" did not know about the ones that had died, at least according to the account Murray has told authorities, Halpern said.
Why?
Whether based in reality or not, Halpern said Murray was "a prisoner of her own fear" and suggested it was that fear that explains the three infants found dead in her home.
This was not the first time a 51A had been filed when it came to that home, according to a Massachusetts Department of Children and Families spokeswoman.
"Our investigation will continue for quite some time," said Joseph Early, the Worcester County District Attorney.
