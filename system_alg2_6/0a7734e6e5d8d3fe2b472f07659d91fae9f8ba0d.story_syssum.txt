Advertising Age also recently pointed out that despite Starbucks being the world's largest coffeehouse chain with more than 13,000 locations in more than 50 countries, even its most devout customers purchase only three of every 10 cups of coffee they drink from Starbucks.
Its coffee brands include Folgers and Millstone, and it also manufactures and distributes Dunkin' Donuts coffee to sell in grocery stores.
Additionally, Starbucks wants to capture a larger share of the U.S. brewed coffee market by leaning on its VIA Ready Brew line and Seattle's Best coffee brand to increase the number of distribution points.
McDonald's coffee sales have increased every year since the company first introduced its McCafe line of premium coffee in 2006.
