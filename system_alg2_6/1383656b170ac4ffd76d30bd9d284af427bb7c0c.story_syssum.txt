(CNN) -- A top Zetas drug cartel leader -- who allegedly ordered the attack and arson at a casino that killed 52 -- has been captured, Mexican defense officials said Thursday.
Oliva Castilo began working for the Zetas in 2005 in Tamaulipas, the defense ministry said, and rose through the ranks quickly.
The three northeastern states that Oliva Castillo allegedly oversaw are some of the Zetas' strongest-held territory.
The Zetas have been blamed for the mass graves and for the deaths of the migrants.
