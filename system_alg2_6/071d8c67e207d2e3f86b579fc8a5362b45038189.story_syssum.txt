Richard and Mayumi Heene had met in a Hollywood acting school and pursued fame for their family in the world of reality TV, Larimer County Sheriff Jim Alderden said.

The plan included misleading the media on Friday when Alderden said authorities still believed the incident was not a hoax.
Alderden said that under Colorado law, authorities cannot announce whether polygraph tests were taken -- only that authorities pursued them.
Authorities spoke with Mayumi Heene about domestic violence and the children's safety, Alderden said.
Alderden said the boy may not have even been in the home.
The sheriff said investigators also want to interview 25-year-old researcher Robert Thomas who worked with Heene for about two months last spring.
