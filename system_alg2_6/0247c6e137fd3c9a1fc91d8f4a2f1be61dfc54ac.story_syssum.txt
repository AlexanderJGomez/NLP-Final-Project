"As responsible members of the Japanese community, and consistent with the values of our military, we will continue to do everything possible to prevent incidents," said Lt. Gen. Bruce A. Wright, commander of the U.S. forces in Japan.
Police in Okinawa said Thursday they were investigating a second reported sexual assault involving an employee of the U.S. Army.
"I just want to make very clear the great regret that we feel about this, the concern that we feel for the Okinawa people," Hill said.
The U.S. military announced Wednesday that it was restricting the movements of all American troops and their families in Okinawa because of the allegation involving the Japanese girl.
The military observed a similar "Day of Reflection" after that incident.
"The U.S. military bases in Okinawa and Japan are not welcome," Watanabe said.
