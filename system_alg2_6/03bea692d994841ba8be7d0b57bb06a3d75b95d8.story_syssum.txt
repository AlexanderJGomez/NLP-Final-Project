"It's a time when Israel is really joining the family of modern nations, and Playboy is just part of modern global culture," says Dan Pomerantz, who emigrated from his native Chicago to Israel 15 months ago.
Some observers believe that reading the Hebrew edition of Playboy could still be seen as political statement.
"It doesn't see itself as political, but it is political -- it advocates for hedonism and sexual pleasure and the right for women to bare their body in public... Those are deeply political statements in Israel in a way that they are not really political in other countries."
"We don't see ourselves as a magazine company," says Pomerantz.
For all the potential pitfalls of print publishing and dealing with controversial content, Pomerantz remains bullish about the magazine's ability to push a few boundaries.
We've seen so far a real interest that we want to encourage."
