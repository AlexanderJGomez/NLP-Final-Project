(CNN) -- Zabiullah Mujahid, one of two spokesmen for Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, spoke recently with CNN's Nic Robertson about the war in Afghanistan and the Taliban's relationship with al Qaeda.
And No.
2 I want to tell you clearly our Afghan nation is held hostage by foreign troops.
I told you clearly it is what the U.S. wants in Afghanistan, and yesterday as announced by our leader Mullah brother we will target the Afghan parliamentary members and government officials so if there are elections yes it is clear we will target them.
Yes the suicide attack is part of our war with the crusader so when we need a suicide attack we will do the suicide attack.
Where there is the combat war, we will do it in that place.
We will fight them and we will target them.
Mujahid: I will clearly tell you.
CNN: Some people say President Obama has made Afghanistan a very big part of his foreign policy.
I want to tell you clearly we will win, and they will die.
We want to negotiate and they will not interfere in our affairs.
Third, leave the Afghan people to do what they want to do, like the Islamic government they want to establish.
[When] one wants to talk with us and we want to talk, it will be clear.
Mujahid: I want to tell you clearly it is war.
I will tell you we will win; we have the support of Muslim nations and this is what we believe.
Mujahid: Taliban is one thing and al Qaeda is another.
?
Mujahid: Even any place including al Qaeda, but we don't fight under their instruction.
