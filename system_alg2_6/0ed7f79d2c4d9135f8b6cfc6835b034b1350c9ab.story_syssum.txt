YANAGAWA, Japan (CNN) -- Wearing a Nashville School of Law T-shirt, Christopher Savoie walked into a second-floor police interrogation room.
Children have the right to see both parents.
They have charged Savoie, 38, a Tennessee native and naturalized Japanese citizen, with kidnapping his two children -- 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca -- as his estranged wife, Noriko, was walking them to school Monday in Yanagawa, a rural town in southern Japan.
A United States court then granted sole custody to Savoie.
And, police said, the children are Japanese and have Japanese passports.
"In the States, my ex-wife is the one who's in the wrong."
"He did it for the love of his children."
"I love you, Isaac, Rebecca," he said.
I am very sorry that I can't be with you."
