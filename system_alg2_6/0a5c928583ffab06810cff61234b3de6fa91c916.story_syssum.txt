It was FSU's second BCS crown and third national title.
The Tigers appeared to be on the verge of their second title in four seasons when Tre Mason scored a go-ahead touchdown on a determined 37-yard scamper with 1:19 left in the game.
The only score in the third quarter was a 41-yard field goal by FSU kicker Roberto Aguayo.
Auburn kicker Cody Parkey's 22-yard field goal with 4:42 left made the score 24-20.
