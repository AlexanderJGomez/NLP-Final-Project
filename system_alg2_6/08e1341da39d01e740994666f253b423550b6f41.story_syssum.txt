The concept is relatively new (launched last October), so as of now, Houssard and Alfano are still in talks with various airlines.
In the 1990s, Swissair installed gambling software that allowed passengers to bet up to $350 on a variety of casino classics, including poker, keno and blackjack.
However, the idea of in-flight gambling re-emerged a few years ago.
Ryanair announced in 2004 that it would introduce gambling through an in-flight entertainment system, though this too has yet to come to fruition.

A lot of things are changing."
