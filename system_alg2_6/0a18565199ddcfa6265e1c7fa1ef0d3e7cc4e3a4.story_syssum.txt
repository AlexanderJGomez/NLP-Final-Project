When Barbour pardoned Bostick in January, the convicted DUI felon was sitting in an Oxford, Mississippi, jail cell for violating the terms of a previous DUI sentence and was awaiting formal charges from yet another drunken driving accident in October that ended in the tragic death of 18-year-old Charity Smith.
The young woman's death and the controversy surrounding the case have devastated Linda Smith, Charity's mother.
The Mississippi Parole Board and Barbour have issued statements saying they didn't know Bostick had another DUI arrest in October.
Bostick was still going through the drug court program when he started applying for a pardon last summer.
On September 30, the Mississippi Parole Board sent its review of the Bostick case to Barbour.
Because his third DUI was pardoned, a conviction in the latest DUI case would technically be his third offense, but that would still make it a felony in Mississippi.
A Department of Corrections spokeswoman referred all questions about the case to the Mississippi Parole Board.
Linda Smith, Charity's mother, worries her teenage daughter's death has been forgotten in all of this.
A beautiful person," said Linda Smith.
The girl with the artist's heart is now mourned by her mother with a broken heart.
