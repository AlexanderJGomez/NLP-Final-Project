SAO PAULO, Brazil (Reuters)  -- A Colombian man who authorities say is one of Latin America's biggest drug traffickers wants to be extradited to the United States from a Brazilian jail and is willing to cooperate with U.S. anti-drug agents, his attorney says.
Two DEA agents are questioning him in the jail," Alambert told O Estado de S.Paulo newspaper.
"The operation is an example of the way the DEA and Brazilian authorities work together all the time.
U.S. authorities have described him as extremely violent, and Brazilian police said he was behind at least 15 killings in the United States and more than 300 in Colombia.
