(CNN) -- Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir arrived in neighboring South Sudan on Monday for talks on unrest in the latter nation that has left hundreds dead.
The negotiations "come not a moment too soon," African Union Chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said in a statement.
South Sudan erupted in violence on December 15 when rebels loyal to ousted Vice President Riek Machar tried to stage a coup.
Though South Sudan and Sudan divorced, they still have unresolved oil issues.
