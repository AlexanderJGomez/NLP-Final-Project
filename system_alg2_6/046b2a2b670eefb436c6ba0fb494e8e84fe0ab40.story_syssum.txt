Some iPhone 5 users are complaining that a burst of purple is showing up in their photos -- and Apple seems to be acknowledging it's just part of how the camera works.
He claims Apple support staff first said the discoloration shouldn't be happening but shifted after talking to Apple engineers.
Some of the 5's images had a purple glow around light sources, while others didn't, Mashable reported.
Foremost have been problems with Apple's new Maps feature, which for the first time replaced Google Maps as the default mapping software on Apple's mobile operating system.
