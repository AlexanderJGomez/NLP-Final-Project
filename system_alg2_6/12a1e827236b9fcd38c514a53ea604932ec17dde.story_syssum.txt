LONDON, England (CNN) -- Playing the Nintendo Wii Fit could improve balance and help avoid falls in seniors, researchers taking part in a new study suggest.
It is hoped that using the Wii Fit's balance board can improve elderly people's balance and confidence.
Associate Professor Rick van der Zwan who led the research said initial results were "positive."
Van der Zwan now wants to recruit 15 more research participants to broaden the study.
Her bowling partner Fisher told CNN he recently played the boxing game on Wii Fit with his four-year-old great-grandson.
"It really spans all ages, although my great-grandson knocked me out twice," the former bricklayer said.
