LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The two youngest stars in "Slumdog Millionaire" will get "a substantial sum of money" that would "change their lives for the better" when they turn 18, but only if they stay in school, director Danny Boyle told CNN.
"Slumdog Millionaire" is nominated for 10 Oscars, including best picture and best director for Boyle.
"The children were paid well," Boyle said.
"Some of the figures that have been quoted have been very inaccurate," Boyle said.
