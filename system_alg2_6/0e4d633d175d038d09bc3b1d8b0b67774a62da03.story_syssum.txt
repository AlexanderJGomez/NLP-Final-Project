(WIRED) -- In an effort to streamline and simplify the maturity ratings of software in mobile app stores, CTIA, the international wireless industry association, yesterday proposed a ratings system that store owners could voluntarily adopt.
In its App Store, Apple provides an age rating ranging from 4+ to 17+, and lists the reasons for assigning its maturity rating.
CTIA announced it would be developing its app rating system in March.
The ESRB would regularly test popular applications and monitor complaints.
