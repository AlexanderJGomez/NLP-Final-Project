Recent US PGA champion Rory Mcilroy sits two under par after his third round of 69 helped him recover from his poor second round.
However, two bogeys on the back nine, after a fine birdie on the 13th, left the American one stroke over for the day.
The delightful put was the American's longest of the year.
