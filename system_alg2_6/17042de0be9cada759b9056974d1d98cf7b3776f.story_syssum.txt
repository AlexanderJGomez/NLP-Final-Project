It's Delta Air Lines' new "Basic Economy" fare, part of the airline's new five-fare class of pricing starting March 1.
Note the options on the other end of the seating spectrum: The first-class cabin will be split into "First Class" for domestic routes and "Delta One" for long-haul international and certain cross-country domestic flights.
The "Main Cabin" coach fares on domestic and long-haul international flights will allow seat selection at time of purchase and flexibility for flight changes.
And who will guard that dedicated overhead bin space for "Delta Comfort+" travelers, Hobica asks.
"The lowest fare class doesn't allow advanced seat selection?"
That pricing structure seems Spirit-esque."
