"Roberto did a great job, it's not easy to win the title after 43, 44 years," Pellegrini said.
"He shares the club's approach to football and our ambition to achieve onfield success, coordinating with the wider football support teams to ensure natural progression from the Academy to senior level," said Manchester City chief executive Ferran Soriano.
"We have been greatly impressed throughout the selection process by his philosophy, his attitude, and his commitment to the long-term development of Manchester City," City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak said.
His hiring completes managerial changes at the top three teams in the Premier League, after David Moyes replaced the retiring Alex Ferguson at Manchester United and Mourinho took over from Rafael Benitez at Chelsea.
Malaga, meanwhile, announced Friday that former Real Madrid manager Bernd Schuster would replace Pellegrini at La Rosaleda.
