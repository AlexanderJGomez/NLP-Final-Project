Along with Ferrari's new car comes a new driver -- the quietly charismatic Kimi Raikkonen replaces Brazil's Felipe Massa -- and new hope that the Finn and Spain's Fernando Alonso can return the team to championship-winning ways.
This year's car is the 60th built by Ferrari for the F1 world championship with the F14 T name being chosen by fans via a poll on the Ferrari F1 team's website.
Jonathan Neale, managing director of McLaren Racing said in a statement: "We've never had such significant new regulations before; reacting to them, and managing those changes, while still pushing the performance limits, has been an extremely tough job.
Testing for the new season, which starts in Melbourne on March 16, begins at the end of January in Jerez, Spain.
