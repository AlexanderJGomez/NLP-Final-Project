ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- More than 80 years after his family was ordered from the country, the grandson of one of the last Ottoman sultans was buried Saturday as hundreds of admirers looked on.
In 1922, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the modern Turkish Republic, sent the last Ottoman sultan packing aboard a British warship.
Over the years, Osman told reporters he had no interest in assuming the Ottoman throne.
The hundreds of mourners at Saturday's funeral stunned other surviving members of the Ottoman royal family.
"I am quite surprised.
Osman's death serves as a reminder of Turkey's recent, yet often forgotten Ottoman history, said historian Jason Goodwin.
