In his second debate with Mitt Romney, the president delivered a comeback performance that will stand as a model for future debaters of how to right a listing ship.
But by the end of the debate, he had checked off pretty much every item on his list of "Things I Should Have Done in Denver."
Clearly this was not the role Romney intended to play.
The town hall debate was a particularly inappropriate setting for Romney to display this side of himself.
"It's not as big as yours," came the answer, "so I don't look at it that often."
The governor's response might have been written by the staff of "Saturday Night Live:" "President Bush and I are different people and these are different times," he said.
