WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Transportation Security Administration is looking into a report that Louisiana Sen. David Vitter had an angry altercation with an airline worker at Washington Dulles International Airport last week.
The paper said an airline worker warned him not to enter the walkway, which led to a "tirade" by Vitter who "remained defiant."
He denied allegations he had relationships with prostitutes, but apologized for "a very serious sin."
