If a new president comes to the White House -- if Romney and Ryan win -- will America find itself once again at war?
A look at how Romney and Ryan would respond to the challenges facing America is as revealing as it is stunning.
That was in 2009.
And, by the way, we have to.
On Iran, arguably the most important foreign policy question and conceivably a new war front for America, both Romney and Obama have stated that Iran must not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons.
Obama went even further, saying "Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel and it must remain undivided."
To be sure, rhetoric and images matter a lot.
But Obama may do just the same.
