Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- The numbers tell a small part of the story: Eight dead in a bomb blast.
The whimpering of a woman near tears moments after the bomb blast.
And again.
The video was shot by Johan Christian Tandberg, who was driving through a tunnel under the government building that was the target of the attack when the bomb went off.
The resulting video shows central Oslo littered with street signs ripped out of the ground by the blast, insulation torn from buildings, and people wandering in shock.
And the alarm bell rings.
