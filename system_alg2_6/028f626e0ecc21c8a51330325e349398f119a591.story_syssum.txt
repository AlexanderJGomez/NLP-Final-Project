(CNN) -- Since China took part in the Olympic Games in 1984 after a three-decade absence, competitive sports have served one purpose -- to build national pride.
In 2008, China won 51 gold medals (100 medals overall) and topped the gold medal tally at the Beijing Olympic Games.
Better grades means better universities, better universities means better jobs.
However, we also see that more kids (and parents) are embracing sport and the values it teaches.
These are the qualities that will help them to secure that better future over and beyond their academic performance.
In today's China, the demand for sports has gone beyond Olympic gold medals and national pride.
