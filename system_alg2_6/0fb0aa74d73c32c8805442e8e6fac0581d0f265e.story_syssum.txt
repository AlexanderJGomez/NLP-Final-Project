SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- North and South Korea will hold three days of talks on reunions for families torn apart by the Korean War and divisions between the two countries, South Korea's Unification Ministry said Tuesday.
Although the president reiterated his firm stance on North Korea, South Korean Unification Minister Hyun In Taek met with North Korean unity leader Kim Yang Gon on Saturday.
Earlier this month, South Korea responded positively, but cautiously, to a joint agreement announced Monday between North Korea and the South's Hyundai Group to resume cross-border tourism, ease border controls and facilitate cross-border family reunions.
The announcement of the agreement followed a weekend meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and Hyundai chairwoman Hyun Jeong-eun.
