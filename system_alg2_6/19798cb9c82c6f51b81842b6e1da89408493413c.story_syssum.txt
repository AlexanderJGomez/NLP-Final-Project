(CNN)  -- Former U.S. President Bill Clinton landed in North Korea early Tuesday on a mission to negotiate the release of two American journalists imprisoned there since March, according to the country's state news agency and a CNN source.
Will Clinton be carrying a letter from Barack Obama for the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il?
North Korea conducted a nuclear bomb test, its second, in May, and has conducted several missile tests since then.
His secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, had gone to Pyongyang in early 2000 to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il -- now widely reported to be ill.
