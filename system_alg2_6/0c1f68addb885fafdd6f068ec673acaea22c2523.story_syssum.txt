(CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Thursday that he is breaking off relations with Colombia.
Colombia has accused Chavez of supporting the rebels, and Chavez has said Colombian officials and right-wing paramilitary units have plotted his assassination.
Colombia said it had evidence that shoulder-fired anti-tank weapons recovered from FARC guerrillas were of Venezuelan origin.
Venezuela denied the allegations and said the rebels may have stolen the weapons from a Venezuelan base.
