While it is considered a delicacy in Japan and some other countries, meat from whale -- an endangered species -- cannot be sold legally in the United States.
Armed with a hidden camera, the two women captured the waitress serving them whale and horse meat and identifying them as such, a federal criminal complaint said.
He identified the whale sample to be that of sei whale, prosecutors said.
The next, officials raided the restaurant and chef Yamamoto admitted that he had served whale meat, the complaint said.
Whaling is allowed under international law when done for scientific reasons, which Japan cites as the legal basis for its hunts.
Critics say that Japan's research is actually a pretext for retrieving whale meat to be sold in markets and restaurants.
