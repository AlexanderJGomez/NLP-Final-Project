(CNN) -- A former personal assistant of Waffle House's CEO accused him of forcing her to "perform sexual services," among other degrading acts, during her nine years of working for him, according to an Atlanta police report.
His accuser told police that, starting in 2003, she had worked out of Rogers' house as his assistant handling personal and work-related items.
No charges have been filed in the case.
