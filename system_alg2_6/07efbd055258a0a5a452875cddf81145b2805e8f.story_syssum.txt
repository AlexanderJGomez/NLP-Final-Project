A new CNN investigation reveals what most analysts have been saying since the "birther" controversy erupted during the 2008 presidential campaign: Obama was born in Hawaii on August 4, 1961.
Dr. Chiyome Fukino, a former director of the Hawaii Department of Health and a Republican, told CNN in her most extensive comments to date that she has "no doubt" Obama was born in the state.
"He was absolutely born here in the state of Hawaii."
Like Obama, Waidelich's birth was announced at the time in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin newspaper.
...
He said he wants to find someone who saw Obama immediately after the president was born.
"Of course, we had no idea at the time that the future president of the United States was that little boy, that little baby," Abercrombie recalled.
She said there is "no way" Obama wasn't born in the state.
"I find it a bit amusing in the sense that (the issue) keeps resurfacing over and over again," Fukino said.
That, the evidence suggests, may be easier said than done.
