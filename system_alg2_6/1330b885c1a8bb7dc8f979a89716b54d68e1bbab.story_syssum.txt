She's a 12-time medalist who at the 2008 Games earned the title of oldest American swimmer to win an Olympic medal.
Torres took her time getting out of the pool, looking up at the stands where for nearly three decades she has been cheered on her in Olympic bids.
Last month, Torres told CNN's Piers Morgan that the road to the London Games for her would be a tough one.
She then took a seven-year break before returning for the 2000 Sydney Games, where she would win two gold relay medals and first individual Olympic medals: three bronzes medals in the 50-meter freestyle, 100-meter freestyle and the 100-meter butterfly.
She made her last comeback at the Beijing Games in 2008, where she earned a silver medal in the 50-meter freestyle and the title of the oldest American woman to swim for the U.S. team.
