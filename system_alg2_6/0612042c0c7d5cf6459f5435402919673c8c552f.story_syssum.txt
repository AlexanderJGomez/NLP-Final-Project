(CNN) -- Mychal Bell, a black teenager accused of beating a white classmate and who was the last of the "Jena 6" behind bars, was released from custody Thursday after a juvenile court judge set his bail at $45,000.
"Let America know -- we are not fighting for the right to fight in school.
Many said they were angry that the students, dubbed the Jena 6, were being treated more harshly than three white students who hung nooses from an oak tree on Jena High School property.
Walters said his decision not to appeal was based on what he believed was best for the victim in the case.
Prosecutors originally charged all six black students accused of being involved in beating Barker with second-degree attempted murder and conspiracy.
Bryant Purvis awaits arraignment.
"I firmly believe and am confident of the fact that had it not been for the direct intervention of the Lord Jesus Christ last Thursday, a disaster would have happened," Walters said.
"The Lord Jesus Christ put his influence on those people, and they responded accordingly," he said, without explaining exactly what he meant.
