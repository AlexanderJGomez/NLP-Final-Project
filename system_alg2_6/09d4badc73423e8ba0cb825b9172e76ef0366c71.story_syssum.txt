President-elect Barack Obama greets Sen. John McCain on stage after praising him at a bipartisan dinner.
"Tomorrow, the President-elect will accept the burdensome privilege of leading America to its next accomplishments and its future greatness," McCain went on to say.
"I'm here tonight to say a few words about an American hero I have come to know very well and admire very much -- Sen. John McCain," Obama said as he opened his speech.
Obama's speech at the bipartisan dinner capped a day filled by appearances, including visiting wounded soldiers and exhorting Americans to spend more time in the service of others.
Wigal said Obama's inauguration has given residents hope that change actually will happen.
Obama visited a National Day of Service project, stopping by the Sasha Bruce House, an emergency shelter for homeless teenagers in the Washington area.
"Those of us who live and work here, who try to create, shape, influence and move policy forward, are feeling as if we can finally do something that'll result in forward motion," Wigal said.
For Wigal, that's exactly what makes Inauguration Day so important.
"I am making a commitment to you, as your next president, that we are going to make government work," Obama said.
