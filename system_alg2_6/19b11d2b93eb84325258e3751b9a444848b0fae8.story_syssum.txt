According to Ed Magee, spokesman for the prosecuting attorney's office, the grand jury is focused on whether Wilson should be charged with any one of several possible crimes, including first-degree murder, second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter.
If Wilson is charged and then eventually found guilty of first-degree murder, he could face up to life in prison without parole, or death, if the death penalty is sought, according to Joy.
If prosecutors can prove Wilson acted while in a fit of anger or rage when he shot Brown, they might be able to secure a conviction on voluntary manslaughter.
If found guilty, Joy said, Wilson could be sentenced to no more than seven years in prison.
