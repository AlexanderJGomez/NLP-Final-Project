(CNN)A St. Louis man has filed a lawsuit alleging excessive force in a case that involves an officer turning off a dashcam that was recording the man's arrest.
They did.
While officers attempted to place him in handcuffs, one saw the handle of a handgun sticking out of Bufford's right front pocket.
The officer who shut off the dashcam video was referred to an internal affairs department, Calvert said.
When we saw that an officer had violated that policy, it was very disappointing," he said.
According to a statement from St. Louis prosecutor Jennifer M. Joyce, the "action of turning off the dash camera video diminished the evidentiary merits of the case."
