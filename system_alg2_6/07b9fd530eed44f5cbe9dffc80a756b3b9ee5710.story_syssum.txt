At the border, before going back to China, a group of security guards confiscated my camera and erased all images they thought were inappropriate, or did not portray the country in a favorable light.
We also talked about why the outside world has such a negative view of North Korea; something he was very sad about.
"No problem," said my guide.
My guide had a hard time keeping up with me, but he never once told me to lower my camera or slow down.
After breakfast I decided to go for a walk alone.
My guide said they were erasing "inappropriate" pictures, with no further explanation.
Looking at the censored photos, I was surprised about the selection.
Some were of angry looking security guards with scruffy barracks in the background, others of government officials going through our passports.
But so are a lot of things about the world's most isolated country.
