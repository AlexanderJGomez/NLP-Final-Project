Most UK bookmakers this week, aside from a few outliers, give Obama 1 to 4 odds (if you bet $1 and win, you get $1.25 back), while Romney is getting 11 to 4 odds (for every $4 you bet, you get $11 back).
Paddy Power, like most international bookmakers, has Obama as the favorite and Romney as the underdog in Tuesday's election.
In order to set the odds, Iomarie says a group of bookies in Ireland comb through much of the same data that American political watchers read.
According to Intrade, Obama has a 66.3% chance of winning the election.
Like most betting sites, Intrade does not allow U.S. credit or debit cards to be used on the site -- a way to basically prohibit Americans from betting on the election.

But it is a very close election," he said.
"It is a market that is malformed," Chris said.
