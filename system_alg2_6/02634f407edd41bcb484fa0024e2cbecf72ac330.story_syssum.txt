Female veterans are also more likely to be single parents, the VA says, which can make it more difficult to find adequate housing.
Since 2011, she has provided transitional housing or financial assistance to more than 50 female veterans and their children through her nonprofit, Final Salute.
In the past two years, Boothe has opened two transitional homes in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, where veterans and their children can live for up to two years while they get their lives back on track.
"We offer wrap-around services ... anything they could possibly need to help get themselves back in a state of independence," Boothe said.
As a single mother, Boothe joined the Army Reserves to make a better life for herself and her young son.
When Boothe asked the VA what assistance was available for her, she was told they didn't have any programs that could help with the challenges she was facing as a female veteran with a dependent child.
Boothe joined her young son in Missouri, where she was able to eventually get her life back together.

Boothe is determined to help as many female veterans as she can.
