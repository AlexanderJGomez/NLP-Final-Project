The Late-1980s pop culture relic "21 Jump Street" was a primo specimen of a TV police procedural with a catchy hook: A team of fresh-faced cops work undercover as high school kids, reporting back to their tough/earnest boss at the address listed above.
On the surface, "21 Jump Street" follows the crime-fighting antics of odd-couple cop partners Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum).
They get to work issues out.
And by the way they get to bust a drug ring fronted by a smart and popular guy played with oddball charisma by Dave Franco.
Also, Tatum can sustain a great, I mean great, Dumb Face.
