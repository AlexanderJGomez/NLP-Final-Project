That's when it kind of hit me that there was no place for women to go for a great blowout in a great space.
W: We have so many, like "life is too short to be somewhere lame," "pretty is as pretty does," I heard that my whole life growing up.
W: I get my kids off to school that's first and foremost, I'm usually at my office for a little while and I'm usually based in LA so I try to hit as many LA stores as I can.
I do work in the office a lot too because we have so much going on there but I really try to get out in the field and make surprise visits just so I can see what's going on, stay connected, get a blowout, whatever.
I've always had long thick curly hair and people when you typically walk into salons they say well for you it's gonna be $60 but for your friend it's $50 and it felt so discriminatory towards me and I wanted women to feel like there's no bait and switch, it was $40 no matter how long your hair is, if we curl it, flat iron it it's always gonna be $40.
