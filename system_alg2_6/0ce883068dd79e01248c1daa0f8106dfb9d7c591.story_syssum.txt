Martin Greenfield: It was our second day inside Auschwitz.
The soldiers asked if we knew any trades, like masonry, carpentry, medicineâ€”that kind of thing.
As soon as my father offered up my skills, two Germans walked toward us to take me away.
My arms pumped hard as I stretched my stride and ran faster than I'd ever run before.
I snapped my head back over my shoulder and saw the dog closing in.
The two soldiers tromped over to retrieve the dog and make sure he was uninjured.
That day, my second inside Auschwitz, was the last time I ever saw my father.
Still, I grabbed a brush and an SS soldier's shirt and scrubbed hard and fast.
The shirt was trash to the soldier but not to me.
To this day I still don't know why, but when I got up the courage, I slipped the soldier's shirt on and wore it under my striped prisoner uniform.
They wanted to please the Germans, so some of them would be hard on us so the Germans would not punish them.
And so I wore the shirt.
They did for me.
