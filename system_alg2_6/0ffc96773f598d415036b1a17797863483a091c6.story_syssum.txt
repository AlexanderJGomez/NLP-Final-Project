CNN spoke with Klosterman about the inspiration for the book, writing about and participating in the interview process, and how no one is going to relate to the two main characters in his new novel.
I was living in Germany at the time, teaching for the University of Leipzig, so I got it through Amazon Europe or whatever, and it was an edition of the book that was "The Time Machine" and "The Invisible Man."
He was just this kind of egocentric, weird person.
Klosterman: No.
But here's the trick, or, I guess, the paradox: Even though interviewing is this incredibly flawed process, it's still the best means we have for understanding people we don't know.
There's certainly a thinking, and I didn't see this as much when I worked in newspapers, but when I moved to New York and ended up being surrounded mostly by critics, I came to the realization that a lot of people sort of work under the impression that not only is interviewing not helpful, but that it's mostly detrimental.
That's one of the weird things about this book.
Well, it would be someone who is insecure, and someone who is just smart enough to be kind of dumb.
I mean, it's kind of a cliche thing; it seems like something you worry about when you're 17, but I've never stopped worrying about it.
Klosterman: Both.
Like, "Am I really writing a book?"
I think that, in general, when I write nonfiction, I want it to seem like hyperreality, for it to feel like you're reading fiction.
But when I write fiction, I want it to seem like journalism.
