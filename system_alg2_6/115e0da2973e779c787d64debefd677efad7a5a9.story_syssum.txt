Anton Caluori, 31, was arrested Tuesday at his home in Federal Way, a Seattle, Washington, suburb, Agent Bryan Molnar said in an affidavit.
Molnar said he and Federal Way police officer Andy Hensing went to the apartment complex at the address, where an employee told them Caluori was a "hothead" with a "temper" who lived with his mother.
But then he "moved his right hand from behind his back revealing a stockless black pump-action shotgun with a pistol grip," the affidavit said.
Caluori continued to struggle and would not comply with our commands," Molnar said in the affidavit.
The pistol on his ankle was loaded with "five hollow point .38 special caliber rounds," it said, and about 50 12-gauge shotgun rounds were recovered from the shotgun and the bandoleer.
After reading Caluori his Miranda rights, Molnar asked him if he knew why the police were at the scene.
Call the CIA or run it up the chain of command," Molnar said.
Caluori is in custody at the Federal Detention Center at Sea-Tac, Washington.
