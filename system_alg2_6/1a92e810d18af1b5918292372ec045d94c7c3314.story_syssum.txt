Léogâne, Haiti (CNN)  -- Joanie Yestin walks through a small alleyway to what used to be home, now a pile of concrete and crushed belongings.
Yestin, like many of Haiti's almost 10,000 Boys and Girls Scouts, decided to contribute her share to the earthquake relief effort.
"It is important to involve young people right from the start," Perez said.
But as determined as Yestin is to help, this particular community chore is hardly easy for her Scout troop.
She tore open the plastic-on-foam mattresses and blankets to hand out to the needy.
"It was God's will" that her father died, she had said earlier.
She had wanted to attend university, study communications.
"I love the way we work together," she said of the Scouts.
