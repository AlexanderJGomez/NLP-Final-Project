BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) -- Federal officials said Monday they are probing allegations by a former investigator into the deadliest terrorist attack in Argentine history that he was kidnapped and tortured by men who said they were national intelligence agents.
Lifschitz said his abductors tortured him while asking about the AMIA investigation.
Lifschitz, who has also worked as a lawyer for Argentine Federal Police, is the former legal secretary for Judge Juan Jose Galeano, who headed the investigation into local connections to the AMIA bombing until he was removed from the case.
Menem appeared in federal court Monday on an issue related to the AMIA attack investigation but declined to testify.
Lifschitz said his alleged abductors were interested in the possible Iranian connection.
Jewish leaders from around the world called for an investigation into the attack on Lifschitz.
Earlier this month, an Argentine court ordered the seizure of property owned by a former Iranian diplomat in Buenos Aires sought for his role in the 1994 AMIA attack.
