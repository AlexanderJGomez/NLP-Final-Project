London (CNN) -- Does part of social media's future lie in the past?
One of those people is Phil Libin, CEO of Evernote, a service that allows users to archive images, documents and other data.
"We want people to have to believe that Evernote will be around for 100 years," Libin told CNN.
But online-archiving services must establish trust with their users to endure, said Maciej Ceglowski, founder of rival bookmarker Pinboard.
"There's no magical technology solution -- it's not like we have a file format that someone will be able to read in 100 years," he added.
But Libin, and Evernote, are trying.
