Officials in Washington said Monday they would grant consular access to the U.S.-held suspect in an alleged Iranian plot to assassinate the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States.
The Iranian Foreign Ministry said the accusations were baseless and called for access to the suspect.
The State Department said last week there had been direct contact with Iran about the alleged plot, but a senior Iranian official denied it.
The alleged scheme involved a connection to the Quds Force, a branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, which formally answers to Khamenei.
It's uncharacteristic," Aslan said.
"Doing so on U.S. soil is unmistakably an attack on the United States, not on Saudi Arabia."
