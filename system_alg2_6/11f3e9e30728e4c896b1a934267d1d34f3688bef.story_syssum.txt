So who could resist the touching story of the New York policeman who, seeing a homeless man sitting barefoot in the cold, walked into a shoe store and bought him a new pair of all-weather boots?
New York City officials say Hillman has had an apartment but, for some reason, returns to the streets.
He has shoes now.
Hillman, 54, has told reporters that he hid the shoes because "they are worth a lot of money."
What matters is that a heartwarming act of kindness -- a man opening his wallet to buy another man shoes -- is not enough to keep him from going barefoot.
But they are also about the soul of the nation.
The U.K.-based Charities Aid Foundation, says Americans are the most generous people on earth.
In Atlanta, just down the street from CNN's headquarters, drivers can spot homeless camps under highway overpasses.
According to those figures, New York has one homeless person for every 2,506 people, compared with one for every 259 in San Francisco.
In Sweden, a determined government effort brought the number of people living in the streets to just 280, with thousands receiving help in alternative housing.
The Christmas Miracle story of the police officer and the homeless man faded in an Internet minute.
Not for any of the homeless people in the streets of New York or Paris, Stockholm or Atlanta, whom we glimpse briefly as we move on with our lives.
For enough attention from the government to those who need it most.
