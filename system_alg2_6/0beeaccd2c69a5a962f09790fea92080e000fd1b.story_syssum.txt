iReporter Clinton Wood, who lives outside Portland in Tualatin, Oregon, acknowledges that Seattle is prettier than Portland.
Among his reasons: Portland has more park space, much better mass transit, a stronger bicycling culture and proximity to superior skiing, a renowned Pinot Noir wine region and great areas for water sports.
"While I love Seattle, let's be clear, Portland is my city," writes Moon, who grew up in Portland.
For Portland-style brunch, Baker recommends Sanborn's, Genies Cafe, Zell's Cafe, The Country Cat and Cadillac Cafe.
"If you visit Portland, Mount Tabor is a must-see," says Moon.
iReporter Crummett suggests a Duck tour for Seattle visitors.
"The city is full of surprises and great shopping," says Crummett, and she recommends excursions to neighboring Bainbridge Island and Bremerton.
Bill, who has lived in both cities but currently calls Seattle home, cast his vote firmly for Portland.
