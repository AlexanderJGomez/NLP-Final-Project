But unusually for influenza, Fukuda said, H1N1 continues at high levels over the summer months, and many of the serious illnesses and deaths are concentrated in people younger than 65.
The virus is also becoming more active in Europe and Central and Western Asia, Fukuda said.
More cases are being reported from a number of Caribbean countries such as Cuba and Haiti, he said.
But Fukuda said that's a dangerous mind-set.
The WHO also has no evidence of widespread resistance to antiviral medication, Fukuda said.
Other useful protections against H1N1 are vaccines, which the WHO recommends against pandemic infections, Fukuda said.
