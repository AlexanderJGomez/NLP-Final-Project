Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Abu Ali is 58 years old.
Their son Ali -- 19 and a week away from his wedding -- was working on the family stall when one of Baghdad's ubiquitous car bombs targeted the market area.
Together they had three children: a son, also called Ali, now aged three, and daughters Rukkaya, four, and Narjis, eight months.
Abu Ali has now lost all three sons.
Abu Ali and his wife, Umm Ali, at first couldn't face telling them the truth, instead saying he'd gone to Mosul for more watermelons.
Alaa's other child, the baby daughter Narjis, was just a few weeks old when her father died.
She counts again, and then once more.
The family hasn't seen or heard from him since.
Six people are crammed into the home, Abu Ali and Umm Ali, and Alaa's widow and three children.
I have lost three sons and the fourth fled and no one cares about us."
We leave Abu Ali and Umm Ali and the grandchildren they now raise and they thank us for telling their story to the world.
