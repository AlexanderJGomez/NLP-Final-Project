Miami, Florida (CNN) -- From the custom-made, hand-beaded white dress to silver-studded high-heeled shoes, diamond jewelry and tiara, Jenny Ferro is preparing for a day she's dreamed about since she was 3 years old.
Jenny and her mother, Marlene Ferro, have worked out every detail of the party well in advance, from the rehearsal to the reception to the flower girl and the music.
One reason for their popularity is a greater acceptance of Latin culture in America, according to Michele Salcedo, author of "Quinceañera!"
"It has gone beyond Latinos, so that a lot of Latino girls will have not only family members in court but they will reach out to non-Latino friends," says Salcedo.
Family plays the largest role in the quinceañera, leading up to and during the party.
"Because when it's done right it can be a beautiful family celebration and a celebration of a milestone that a young girl goes through."
Quinceañeras have changed over the years.
There's a spiritual element to these celebrations as well, says Salcedo.
As the celebrations become more popular in the United States, they also offer an opportunity for more Americans to participate.
I'm throwing this party for my daughter and I'm inviting all of you to partake of my generosity so that you can see exactly how well we've done."
