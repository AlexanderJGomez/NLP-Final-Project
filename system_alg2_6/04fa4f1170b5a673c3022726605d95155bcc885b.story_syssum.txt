But the splash is bigger when such projects fail or when people starting mumbling about Chinese influence.
When a Chinese company bought Volvo, it was the transfer of technology that made the headlines, along with the end of the era for a venerable European brand.
But any attempt it makes to expand in Europe, United States or Africa is met with fears of technology transfer to a firm linked to the Chinese military through its founder.
A change of leadership in Beijing will not have much impact in Europe.
But it did.
That goes to show Europe has to get comfortable with the growing influence of China on its shores.
China has to make sure its investments and intentions are transparent.
