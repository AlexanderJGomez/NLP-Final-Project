The manager of the Fort Calhoun Nuclear Power Plant and his colleagues are bent on dispelling rumors about the condition of their facility: rumors about a meltdown, about a loss of power.
The floodwaters at Fort Calhoun are outside the plant.
That's where it should be.
But outside those barriers, the water is at least 2 feet above ground level.
The transformers power internal pumps, which operate cooling systems keeping the reactor core and the spent fuel rods from overheating.
Gates and his colleagues say the water has not breached the buildings housing the reactor core and the spent fuel rods, and they're confident it won't.
Gates says the Nuclear Regulatory Commission cited the Fort Calhoun plant in 2009 for not being adequately prepared for a flooding event.
Still, NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko had solemn words for the staff of Fort Calhoun after touring the plant on Monday.
