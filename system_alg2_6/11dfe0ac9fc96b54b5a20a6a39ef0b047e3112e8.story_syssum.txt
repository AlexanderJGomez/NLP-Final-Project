The University of North Carolina failed some of its students "for years" by allowing them to take classes that did not match its own academic standards, Chancellor Carol Folt has admitted.
CNN has asked UNC Chapel Hill for the number of students who were specially admitted because they did not meet the usual academic standards and who majored in or took the classes now acknowledged as fake.
Dean told Bloomberg Businessweek, whose parent company's chairman is a UNC trustee, that he would investigate whether student-athletes were "clustering" in departments or classes that were supposed to have easy grades and to see whether there were any other forces or personalities behind the scandal.
The NCAA told CNN on Monday it won't comment on whether the university will take a second look.
