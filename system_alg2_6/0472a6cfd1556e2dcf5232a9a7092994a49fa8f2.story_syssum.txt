(CNN) -- The shooting death of a 21-year-old Mississippi State University student in a campus dorm room is thought to be an "isolated incident," and there is no indication others are endangered, the school's president said Sunday.
"Throughout the night and into this morning, we have kept the campus informed of developments through our Maroon Alert emergency notification system," the president said.
"Our Bulldog Family is saddened by this event and the loss of one of our students," he said.
"Mississippi State University's main campus is located in a rural, low crime area," the university website said.
