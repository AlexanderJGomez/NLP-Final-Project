Marquez equaled Valentino Rossi's record of 10 podium placings in his rookie season, set back in 2000, and became the first rider since the Italian in 2008 to win four successive races.
"I am very happy with the result, because after all the problems with my injury and the doubts we've had at the last few races, we took a big step forward with my mental preparation today," he said.
His teammate Lorenzo was left third in the standings, 18 points behind Marquez.
Especially under braking and on the straights they were faster than me so I couldn't do much more."
