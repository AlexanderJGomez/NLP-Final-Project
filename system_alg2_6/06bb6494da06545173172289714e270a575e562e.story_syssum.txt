But companies that interpret slower GDP growth to mean that business opportunities in China and other emerging markets will begin to fade are making a serious mistake.
This is fueled by steady, rapid growth in the country's middle-class and affluent households, which in China we at The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) regard as having annual disposable incomes of at least $12,500.
Some of the sharpest consumption growth in China is occurring among the upper middle class, which we classify as households with annual disposable household incomes of $25,000 to $50,000.
At BCG, we have been tracking a particularly impressive group of hard-charging competitors that we refer to as "local dynamos" -- emerging market-based companies that are staying home and conquering their domestic markets.
Home Inns & Hotels Management illustrates how Chinese dynamos can operate successfully while moving at warp speed.
After just three years in operation, Xiaomi reached $5 billion in revenue in 2013 and sold more smartphones in China -- nearly 19 million -- than Apple.
A number of companies on BCG's 2014 list of "global challengers" -- fast-growing companies based in emerging markets that are becoming global leaders or have the potential to do so -- have followed the path of leveraging their dominance in domestic markets to go global.
