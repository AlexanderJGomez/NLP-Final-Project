On a day in which the girlfriend of victim Odin Lloyd took the stand and Lloyd's mother again left the courtroom in tears, Bristol County Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh on Friday had a warning for the jury.
Hernandez will not be watching his former team.
But Jenkins said she was not aware of her boyfriend and Hernandez hanging out except for the day Lloyd was killed.
"Aaron Hernandez is not the murderer of his friend," Fee said.
On Thursday, prosecutor Patrick Bomberg said Hernandez not only orchestrated, but also participated in and covered up the killing.
A marijuana blunt found near Lloyd's body had traces of both his DNA and that of Hernandez, Bomberg said.
"As soon as they found out Aaron Hernandez -- a celebrity football player for the New England Patriots -- was a friend of Odin Lloyd's, it was over," he said.
Close friend Daryl Hodge was with Lloyd when he said Lloyd got a text from Hernandez, asking to hang out later that night.
Hernandez pleaded not guilty in the shooting deaths of Ernesto Abreu and Safiro Furtado outside a bar in Boston in 2012.
