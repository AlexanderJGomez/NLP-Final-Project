In "Defiance," Edward Zwick tells the true story of the Bielski brothers, Tuvia (Daniel Craig), Zus (Liev Schreiber) and Asael (Jamie Bell).
He may like a fight, but he's no great shakes when it comes to staging action.
In "Defiance" those words come with a thick, guttural European inflection (Hebrew is spoken as English, though characters also break into subtitled Russian and German on occasion).
Schreiber's Zus, on the other hand, joins with the Soviets to take the fight to the Germans.
It's always comforting to know who the good guys are, even if they're stuck in a not-so-good picture.
