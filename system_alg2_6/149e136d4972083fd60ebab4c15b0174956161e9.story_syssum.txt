The Gongadze killing is the country's most important criminal case, President Viktor Yushchenko said in a statement on his Web site.
The Committee to Protect Journalists welcomed the arrest, it said in a statement to CNN.
Three former police officers were convicted last year of killing Gongadze and given jail sentences of 12 to 13 years, the Committee to Protect Journalists said at the time.
The Ukrainian security service, the SBU, suggested Kravchenko killed himself, and the dead man's successor quoted a suicide note, according to Russian media.
Kuchma had been implicated in the murder by critics who cited secretly recorded audio tapes in which the president allegedly ordered his staff to get rid of the journalist.
