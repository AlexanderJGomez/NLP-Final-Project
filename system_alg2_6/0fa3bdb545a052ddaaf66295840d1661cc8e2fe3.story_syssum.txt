She said she did not witness any sexual abuse.
Dr. Elliot Atkins testified that he had diagnosed Sandusky with histrionic personality disorder after interviewing the former coach.
"I didn't go around seeking out every young person for sexual needs that I've helped," the former coach told the NBC sportscaster in an interview segment that wasn't part of the November 2011 broadcast, but has since been aired.
Ron Kuby, a veteran criminal defense attorney, said there has been a "tsunami of evidence against him" and suggested that the former coach should take the stand.
The final prosecution witness testified Monday that her son seemed to suffer from stomach ailments during the times he was visiting Sandusky and sometimes did not want to visit the former Penn State assistant's home.
The defense then opened its case with a former Penn State coach who testified about Sandusky's stellar reputation in the community.
On Monday, prosecutors dropped one of the 52 counts against Sandusky because the statute he was charged with wasn't in effect on the date of the alleged incident.
