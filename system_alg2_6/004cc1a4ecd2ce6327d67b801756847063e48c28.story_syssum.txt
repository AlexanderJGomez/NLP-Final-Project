Before I became a history professor I carried mail for the Postal Service for 20 years.
Who were my co-workers?
The job allowed many to move into the ranks of middle-class wage earners, where they were able to buy homes and send their children to college.
Postal Service -- a self-supporting quasi-corporate government agency that remains committed to universal service by constitutional and congressional mandate.
Or that the post office is the victim of an artificial deficit created by the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, signed by President George W. Bush, which forces the Postal Service to pre-fund its retiree health benefits 75 years into the future over the next 10 years.
.
And that pre-fund requirement ultimately needs to be repealed to keep the Postal Service from running off the rails.
