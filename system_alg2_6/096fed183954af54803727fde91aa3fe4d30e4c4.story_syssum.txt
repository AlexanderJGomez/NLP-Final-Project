Washington (CNN) -- Beginning Saturday and continuing over the next few weeks, some of the nation's most prominent governors will be leaving office as a new crop of state chief executives are sworn in.
Schwarzenegger's last day in office is next Monday.
While his supporters point to major environmental and political reforms in the state, his popularity plummeted as the state's fiscal problems mounted.
It was very rewarding to make some of the decisions that had to be made, and we really moved the state forward," he told host Jay Leno.
The most scandal-ridden governor to be leaving office now is South Carolina's Mark Sanford, whose fiscal conservative credentials were helping to propel his career.
Eventually his wife, Jenny, divorced him.
In an interview with CNN affiliate WCBD in Charleston, Sanford said one of the things he was most proud in his eight years as governor was bringing some fiscal discipline to the state.
Sanford will be succeeded by Republican state legislator Nikki Haley, a rising star in the GOP.
