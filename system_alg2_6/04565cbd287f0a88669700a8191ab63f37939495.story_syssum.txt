(CNN) -- For better or worse, Iraq and the United States have been attached at the hip for decades.
1: Send in American troops
American troop levels in Iraq peaked at 166,300 in October 2007, according to the U.S. Defense Department.
Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari told CNN on Thursday that no one is calling for "American troops into Iraq."
Still, while the U.S. military might not have a role fighting on the ground in Iraq, it could have a role over it.
Yet, a U.S. official said the Iraqi government had indicated a willingness for the U.S. military to conduct airstrikes targeting members of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and other militants.
Last week, Carney deflected a question about whether Obama might consult Congress before sending warplanes into Iraq -- saying it's too early to give an answer because the President hasn't decided the best course of action yet.
A Defense Department official says that about $15 billion in equipment, training and other services already have gone to Iraq.
"It was a question of when, not if, something like this would happen."
One silver lining to the turmoil is Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government seems to be coordinating with the semiautonomous Kurdish government, American officials said.
Al-Maliki's government, as well as the military, is dominated by Shiites -- leaving Sunnis not only left out but also bitter, so much so that some of them may not see ISIS as a worse option.
The question is still how, exactly, they will support him.
