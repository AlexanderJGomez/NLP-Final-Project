As of Thursday afternoon, the agency's Occupational Health Clinic had seen 54 employees identified to have been in the labs or hallways at the time of exposure, according to CDC spokesman Tom Skinner.
Sometime between then and June 6, procedures in two of the three labs may have aerosolized the spores, the CDC said.
"In the worst-case scenarios, literally, within a day or two of exposure, if you've inhaled spores and if they are very lethal, one begins to get -- as they say -- the standard flu symptoms -- high fever, malaise," said Leonard Cole, a bioterrorism expert.
"And then after a day or two, in the worst case, if you don't get treatment, it could be lethal for you, and beyond treatment," he said.
We will report findings of this investigation and all steps we take to improve lab-safety processes as a result of this incident," the agency's statement said.
