"The entire society has solidarity for the loss of one of the most important and oldest fortresses in our country," said Home Minister Minjur Dorji, who has been on the site for the last three days, in a telephone call.
Although an investigation is still under way, a short circuit in the wiring is believed to have caused the fire, according to the minister, adding that the dzong was 95% built of timber.
No one was killed in the blaze, and all people have been accounted for, the home minister said, noting that Sunday had been a holiday, and that monks' residences were constructed outside the dzong.
In a message to fellow citizens published on Kuensel's website on Tuesday, Prime Minister Jigmi Y Thinley said that Wangdue Phodrong Dzong will be rebuilt just as the Paro Taktsang, nicknamed the Tiger's Nest, was after its own devastating fire in 1998.
This week's fire will prompt Bhutan to shift its policy to protect its centuries-old dzongs, the home minister said.
"It was one of the most magnificent sites of Bhutan -- that dzong," said Dasho Karma.
It was always a great esthetic experience to sit quietly at the point where you could see that dzong."
