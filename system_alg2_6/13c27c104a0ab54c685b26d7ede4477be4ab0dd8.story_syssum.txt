Eleanor Coppola with husband Francis.
Here Eleanor Coppola talks exclusively to CNN about her pride at seeing Sophia win an Oscar, what Francis is really like and just how close "Apocalypse Now" came to disaster.
I think because he spent his life as a director it's just in his nature.
If he were here this moment he could make up a song about you.
He realized it had more serious themes and considerations and it took him deeper and deeper into himself, the issues of life and death and all the heavy questions of war an epic brings to life.
It just got out of control.
TSR: Tell me about how the documentary you shot while Francis was making "Apocalypse Now" came about.
Two people lost their lives in that production, in the course of building.
That is just the way his life is.
EC: It has been deeply satisfying for them to find their way and find their voice, I think particularly for Sophia.
