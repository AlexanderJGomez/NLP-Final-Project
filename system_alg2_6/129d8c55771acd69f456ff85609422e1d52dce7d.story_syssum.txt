I tested the Powerbag messenger bag for about a month, and I also spent a brief time using the backpack, which is very similar.
For one, the idea of carrying a battery about the size of a deck of cards on my back in the rain is not comforting.
Now I need to charge my shoulder bag, too?
On a single charge, it can completely fill about two small gadgets -- a phone and iPod, for example.
A standard USB port is hidden in the battery pouch, so perhaps buying a USB-to-laptop charging cord would do the trick.
The RFA spokesman said this was only an issue with pre-production models, like the one I tested, and that it's been fixed for the bags sold in stores.
