(CNN) -- Police in Albuquerque, New Mexico, released a composite image Tuesday of a young boy found buried beneath the sand of a local playground.
Before the composite image was created, police weren't able to release a photo of the boy because his body was so disfigured by the sand's heat.
Though police have received numerous tips from the public, Walsh said nothing has come from them.
Resident Rachel Lesperance told CNN affiliate KOAT-TV she spent her weekend collecting $3,600 for the boy.
"We're his family now, and we want him to be taken care of like one of our own."
