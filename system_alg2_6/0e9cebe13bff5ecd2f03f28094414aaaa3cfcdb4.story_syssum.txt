Mohammed Asif Mohseni is said to be behind the law.
He is said to be the man behind the controversial Shia state law, a law critics say strips Afghan Shia women of many rights.
He looked at the two men who brought us in and said, "These aren't the two I was waiting for."
But it didn't take long for Mohseni to warm up and explain why Shia state law is just and a part of Islam.
We give women more in this law."
Women should put make-up on for their husbands as it will increase the love and attraction between the two."
"Like, you are working for CNN," he said.
It's the same here.
Clear-cut.
Critics have labeled the law as "Talibanistic," but Samar says even many of the Taliban's actions were not enshrined in law.
And none of the state institutions, ministry of justice, parliament, senate and the office of the president, really didn't look at the law as serious as they should," she said.
