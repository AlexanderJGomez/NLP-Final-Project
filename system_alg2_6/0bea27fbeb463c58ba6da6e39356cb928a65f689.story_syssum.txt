"My strategy has always been to do what I am going to do and focus on my issues," Begich said in an interview with CNN.
But Begich's optimism may not be well-founded -- the reality, says Nathan Gonzales from the Rothenberg Political Report, is that even the most benign votes Begich and his fellow moderates make will be used against them in 2014.
Democrats may also be emboldened by the way voters in some states last week supported Democrats in the Senate even while voting for GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney.
Landrieu "has run three times in a state that has always had a Republican lean, and her numbers have gone up every single time," Campbell said.
You always run hard," Begich said.
"Leader Reid has a difficult task and I think the president is going to be looking to define his legacy," Gonzalez said.
Jim Manley, who used to work as the chief spokesman for Reid, said he expects that the majority leader is going to go out of his way to make sure every Democrat feels comfortable with each vote.
Even so, said a confident Begich, he likes where he is two years out from the election.
