The 76-year-old justice talked Wednesday with CNN's "Piers Morgan Tonight," discussing a range of judicial topics -- from the death penalty to abortion rights and the Bush v. Gore decision.
But Scalia said it was wrong to question Roberts or other court members personally for their legal conclusions.
"We are not a political institution," Scalia said.
"If you don't like the death penalty, fine, change the law," he said.
In his new book, Scalia argues interpreting laws and the Constitution properly requires a strict approach to look at the actual text of the law itself.
On two issues that left Scalia on the losing side -- health care and immigration enforcement -- he displayed the fierce rhetoric that has become his trademark.
Many legal scholars say Scalia ultimately failed to sway his colleagues on the really big constitutional issues, and court sources say he has grown somewhat frustrated over the years being on the losing side of many cases, or not being able to write more majority opinions.
"The court pays more attention now to the text" of the law and the Constitution, he said, and less to legislative history, congressional floor debates and the views of foreign governments.
And he has no plans to step down anytime soon.
