When the 32-year-old New York Knicks lifer first drummed up the plan to follow his beloved NBA team at every stop -- including London -- for an entire season, he had no idea it would be a historic one.
Instead, the Knicks are on course to have their worst season in franchise history with a 5 -- 36 record at the halfway mark.
"I ended up choosing the team most like the Knicks," Doyle explains.
"It's a tough season, so we really appreciate his effort of trying to see all of our games," says Pablo Prigioni, the Knicks Argentinian point guard and Doyle's favorite current player.
"Because of course we never expected this kind of season; but by now we are in the middle of deep changes, so I think in the future the team will be much better."
"But a lot of people in my position will travel the world.
he says.
"That's a lot more hardcore than I am," says Ziad Al-Essa, a 35-year-old Milwaukee Bucks faithful, who flew in from Kuwait and spent $750 on a floor seat to see the London game.
Nevertheless, Doyle admits that he'll be relieved once the season is over, and doubts he'll renew his season ticket even though he thinks the Knicks can become a playoff team next season.
