CNN spoke with "The Walking Dead" showrunner Glen Mazzara about the themes and motivations prevalent in season three, what to expect in the second half and the joys of writing while listening to Prince.
We have a very accelerated pace of storytelling, where we're trying to pack as much story into every episode, and yet, spending a lot of time developing our characters.
CNN: Speaking of the knife's edge, Michonne and The Governor were two highly anticipated characters at the start of this season.
That's something she's used as a model for Michonne -- the strength of the women who suffered great abuses yet carried on.
David Morrissey is an incredibly talented actor who is just interested in finding new layers and nuance to this character.
CNN: The fight scene between The Governor and Michonne in episode eight ("Made to Suffer") is pretty brutal.
CNN: Episode eight also saw the introduction of another new character, Tyreese (Chad Coleman), who's probably best known for his role on "The Wire."
Do the actors have a different take on killing other actors versus zombies?
...
You could see that there's a lot of work that the actors do on their own characters, and we as writers listen and incorporate those dynamics into the scripts.
The audience knows that Rick and his group are a bunch of good-hearted survivors, but yet it's very possible for The Governor to portray them as blood-thirsty murderers to the people of Woodbury because that's what they were.
Mazzara: All of the pieces are up and running: Woodbury, the prison, The Governor, Michonne, the reintroduction of Merle.
I was listening to a lot of Prince.
Listening to Prince is listening to a lot of different types of eclectic music.
