Tamir, 12, was fatally shot in November by a Cleveland police officer, while police shot and killed John Crawford III, 22, in a Walmart in Beavercreek, Ohio, in August.
Tamir was pointing a pellet gun at people outside a recreation center before he was shot, police said.
Within two seconds of exiting the car, Officer Timothy Loehmann shot Tamir, and the boy died the next day, police said.
