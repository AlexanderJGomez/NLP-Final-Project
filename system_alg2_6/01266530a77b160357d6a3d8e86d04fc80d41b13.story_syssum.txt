(EW.com) -- This weekend, "Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters" hunted down the No.
Last weekend's box office champ, Mama, dropped 55 percent into second place with $12.9 million.
"Silver Linings Playbook" dropped by an incredibly small 7 percent in its 11th weekend to $10 million.
Parker opened short of Statham's last three leading efforts, Safe ($7.9 million debut), Killer Elite, ($9.3 million), and The Mechanic ($11.4 million), and it will likely finish below $20 million domestically.
