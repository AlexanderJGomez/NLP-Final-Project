Jesse Shipley died in a car accident in January 2005, and the family members say that even though they agreed to an autopsy, they thought they were burying their son with all of his organs.
He says it is common practice for medical examiners in the U.S. to save the brain and certain other organs when they think it's important.
"To say someone died of a motor vehicle accident, doesn't really tell us anything," Weedn explains.
"The state says we're going to take this body and examine it to see what might have happened, but we promise you, we'll give everything back," Caplan says.
He says in situations where an autopsy has been performed and a bereaved family is concerned whether all the remains have been returned, it is usually up to the family to ask.
But, Weedn says approaching the family with this information is an area where even some medical examiners disagree.
Dr. Cyril H. Wecht, a forensic pathologist and attorney who reviews cases like these but is not involved in the Shipley case, says the medical examiner was right to take out the brain for investigation but was wrong to openly display Shipley's name on it.
He says handling the remains was the most traumatizing aspect for the family.
This is not the way it's supposed to be."
