"I wouldn't even kiss somebody for money," Suleman told CNN's Nischelle Turner.
Suleman dreams of building a business "empire" that will pay for food, shelter and college educations for her 14 children, she told Turner.
Suleman faces up to five years, eight months in prison if convicted, the prosecutor said.
