Bob Hawkins, 75, of Fayetteville, North Carolina, who learned of his ALS diagnosis last year, said Hawking, with his long life and ability to communicate through a voice synthesizer, gives him hope.
The British physicist also embodies the idea of empowering people with ALS to live life to the fullest, said Dr. Lucie Bruijn, scientific director for the ALS Association, in an e-mail.
He has participated in some of the organization's high-profile events, said Mel Barry, communications manager at the MND Association.
ALS affects 350,000 people worldwide and up to 30,000 people in the United States, the ALS Association estimates.
Hawkins said he first experienced weakness in his legs and arms, typical symptoms of the disease.
People with ALS may also find it difficult to lift their arms or feet, Matland said.
In the UK, the MND Association is funding a trial for lithium, which has produced promising results in mice, Barry said.
Hawkins said he will be participating in the 2009 Fayetteville, North Carolina, Walk to Defeat ALS in May.
"I would encourage everyone to recognize how terrible this disease is, and encourage them to support the ALS Association and research projects," he said.
