Last year, a French court sentenced Noriega to seven years in prison for money laundering.
He was convicted of drug trafficking and other crimes in the United States.
Noriega and his attorneys had argued the United States was violating the Geneva Convention by not sending him back to Panama, where he was seized by U.S. troops after the United States invaded that country in 1989 in Operation Nifty Package.
However, he remained in prison while the French extradition issue was decided.
