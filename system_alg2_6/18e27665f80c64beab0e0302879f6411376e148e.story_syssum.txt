One woman in her 50s, who works at a hospice, said she cannot go weeks without an income.
The judge in the case, Belvin Perry, previously ruled that the jury would be sequestered throughout the trial.
A male juror said Tuesday he is one of four nurses on a 24-hour rotation for treating heart attack patients.
A man in his 30s said he runs a family-owned Ace Hardware store.
The man, who has two dogs, no children and no wife because he hasn't ''found the right woman yet,'' said leaving the store for eight weeks would be a big problem, even though he has 34 employees.
Perry is holding jury selection in this Tampa Bay Area city of more than 100,000 to avoid assembling a panel that is likely to be more familiar with the case.
After screening for hardship, the court will ask remaining prospective jurors about their knowledge of the case, whether they could set that aside and if they were to find her guilty could they impose the death penalty.
In a moment of limited levity on Tuesday, Belvin asked one potential juror who planned to visit Savannah, Georgia, with his wife in June for their wedding anniversary whether he would ''be in the dog house'' if the trip were put on hold.
