(CNN)Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said his office has received death threats since his controversial comments accusing President Barack Obama of not loving America.
I believe it," Giuliani said.
While the spokesman said Jindal did not endorse everything the former mayor said about Obama, he added the governor also has deep concerns about the president's leadership on Islamist radicalism.
The Governor acknowledges that not everything that the Mayor said was good, but he believes that Guiliani is a great leader and that this rush by the left and the media to condemn and marginalize him is ridiculous," Anderson said.
"I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the President loves America.
"I think the President is a very poor leader," Giuliani added, saying Obama doesn't measure up to past presidents Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton.
Giuliani said the White House owes him an apology after stating that he had made similar remarks about Obama during the 2008 campaign.
"And the truth is, I don't take any joy, or vindication, or satisfaction from that.
