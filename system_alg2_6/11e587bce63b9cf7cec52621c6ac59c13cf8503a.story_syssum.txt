Gay and lesbian rights activists are detained in Moscow Saturday ahead of a planned march.
UK gay human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, in a statement on his Web site ahead of the march, said it was being held to coincide with the final of the Eurovision Song Contest.

In western Europe, the contest is regard as a light entertainment spectacular, with a strong following among the gay and lesbian community.
The organizers of the contest estimate it is watched by 100 million people worldwide.
