LONDON, England (CNN) -- Mickey Rourke says there is only one person he blames for the spectacular implosion of his career the first time round -- himself.
The Face, battered during his short boxing career and reconstructed with extensive plastic surgery, is, unexpectedly, less of a train wreck in the flesh, although his moustache does look distinctly stuck-on.
"There was so much of the character ... living in shame, the character being a has-been, it was like it hit me in the face really hard," he tells CNN.
But it was more than that.
Whatever it was, Rourke gave up acting and took up professional boxing for four years in the early 1990s and, it seems he was able to fully indulge his self-destructive streak.
He says he is now a changed man and is being welcomed back into the bosom of Hollywood: he is reprising his role as "Marv" in "Sin City 2," is lined up for a role in Sylvester Stallone's "The Expendables" and is in talks to play a villain in the upcoming blockbuster "Iron Man 2" -- his first major studio film since resurrecting his career.
"I'll never lose it all again," he says, "It was too much hard work to get it back and too lonely and too dark.
