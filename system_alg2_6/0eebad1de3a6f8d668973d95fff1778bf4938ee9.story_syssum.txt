Maria Ressa, Editor in Chief of the online news agency Rappler in Manila, said Wednesday morning that conditions in the city were extreme, with howling winds and strong rain.
Fears over storm surges eased as the typhoon began to move away from the city, weakening from a Category 2 storm to a Category 1, with maximum sustained winds of about 150 kilometers per hour.
He said that, at that time, more than an inch of rain was falling per hour in the city, many areas of which are susceptible to flooding.
Infrastructure also suffered, with 15 roads and four bridges becoming impassable.
It was expected to be of Category 2 strength but upon hitting land turned into a Category 3 storm, with sustained winds of 205 kilometers per hour.
The storm cut across the main island of the Philippines, hitting numerous population centers across southern and central Luzon.
