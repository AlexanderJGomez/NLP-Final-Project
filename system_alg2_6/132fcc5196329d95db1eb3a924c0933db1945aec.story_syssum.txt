Hamilton is one of the early favorites for the title, and his Mercedes team lived up to its billing as Nico Rosberg qualified third ahead of McLaren rookie Kevin Magnussen and Ferrari's two-time world champion Fernando Alonso.
"I think we have made a big step forward with the car, but of course I'm not happy that we didn't make it to Q3," he said.
Alonso, the distant runner-up in last year's championship, had the edge on his new Ferrari teammate Kimi Raikkonen, who won the 2013 race ahead of the Spaniard with Lotus but will start 11th this time.
Former Ferrari driver Felipe Massa will start ninth in his first outing for Williams, while Bottas was relegated to 15th.
