Washington (CNN) -- A company dispatcher who was seated in the cockpit jump seat as Southwest Airlines Flight 4013 landed at the wrong Missouri airport has been placed on paid leave pending the outcome of the investigation, the company told CNN on Tuesday.
The NTSB plans to interview the pilots and the dispatcher in the coming days, Holloway said.
An NTSB spokesman said officials planned to interview the pilots, but it was unknown if interviews had been scheduled.
No one was hurt in Sunday's landing on the airport's relatively short runway.
The plane stopped about 500 feet from the end of a runway, said Chris Berndt, the Western Taney County Fire District fire chief and emergency management director.
