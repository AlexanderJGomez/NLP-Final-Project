Time is running out: ISIS put out a video Tuesday giving the Japanese government 72 hours to pay $200 million, or else Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa -- like other ISIS captives before them -- will be killed.
Suga said his government will do its utmost to communicate with ISIS on the fate of Goto and Yukawa through a third party, such as another nation's government or a local tribe.
It was January 2014 when Kimoto met Yukawa, who told him about his dream of providing security for Japanese ships in dangerous areas, such as waters off Somalia sometimes plagued by pirates.
Goto gave Yukawa insights on how to survive there, Kimoto said.
He went back to Syria in July -- a trip that Kimoto said he didn't know about at the time.
I'm Japanese.
Another fixer agreed to take Goto to ISIS, Al Zaim said.
"He is the best journalist I met him, and I work with him because he (doesn't) like military stories.
I have to do that.'"
Those beheaded hostages were American and British, both from countries involved in a military campaign against ISIS.
"Although you are more than 8,500 kilometers away from the Islamic State, you willingly volunteered to take part in this crusade," said the masked man who stood over Goto and Yukawa in Tuesday's video, addressing his comments to Abe.
