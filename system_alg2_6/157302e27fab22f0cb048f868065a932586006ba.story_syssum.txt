With only 20,000 nerve cells -- compared with about 100 billion found in the human brain -- Aplysia are the perfect lab animals for brain researchers hoping to isolate a crucial connection.
One is complex forms of memory, which require the hippocampus and (are called) explicit memory storage.
I'm thinking, 'That's the seat of complex memory, and I want to get complicated.'
You've got to see how a memory is formed.
But if you have a long-term memory, you alter the expression of genes in the brain and you grow new synaptic connections.
Obviously human memory is much more complicated than memory of a snail.
And this is what one finds with the learning process.
And I didn't particularly enjoy the science courses; even in medical school, I enjoyed the clinical work much more than the basic science courses.
I remember having dinner with my wife before we were married and telling her, 'You know, I can see doing this for the rest of my life, but it's ridiculous.
With Alzheimer's disease, you lose explicit memory, complicated memory, so he would have difficulty recognizing people.
But when he sat down at the piano, he could play almost as well as he ever did.
The other reason memory is so important is there is a number of a diseases that affect memory storage, and we'd like to know how they work so we can try to remedy them.
It's Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease -- dreadful disorders that we want to be able to help people with.
With Alzheimer's disease, I think the understanding is surprisingly good.
By the time they come to us with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, they've had the disease for 10 years.

There's much, much more to be studied, and much, much more to be learned.
