In a survey of 4,000 people, about a third said they had accidentally sent an e-mail to the wrong person.
She hastily closed the e-mail and tried to erase the image from her mind.
Instead, the e-mail program automatically filled in an entire group from his address book -- something he apparently didn't realize until after he hit the "send" button.
Karla Comer, an account executive at an ad agency in Greensboro, North Carolina, knows just how embarrassing that can be.
She thought she sent the "he's an idiot" e-mail only to her girlfriend.
Unfortunately, Diamond says, she also sent the e-mail to the client -- oops, make that ex-client.
Then there's BigString.com, an e-mail service which lets you tinker with (or even erase) messages that have already been sent by having the sender write e-mails that are created, stored and viewed on a remote server, where they can be edited or revoked at any time; recipients are actually accessing the e-mail on the remote server when they read the message, even though it looks like a regular e-mail.
If you type just the first few letters and let your e-mail program fill out the rest based on your address book, it could easily misroute your message without your realizing it.
