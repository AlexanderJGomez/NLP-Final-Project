Sen. John Edwards tried to pass off the daughter he fathered as the love child of one of his aides.
Many Americans believe these scandals reflect a precipitous decline in respect for marital fidelity.
So did Warren G. Harding, who also carried on an affair with the wife of a family friend.
Powerful men have "people" to take care of the mundane details of life.
Powerful men are rewarded for being risk takers, a political consultant once told me, whereas women feel more need to control their emotions and impulses if they are to succeed.
As someone who has studied the evolution of love, sexuality, and marriage over the centuries, I believe the frequency of these sexual scandals reflects the fact that many men and women have still not fully incorporated into their daily emotional lives the new ideals about gender equity and mutuality that have emerged in the past 40 years.
But the experiences and emotions of men and women diverged as men began to earn money outside the home while women concentrated on meeting family needs.
I think this pattern helps explain why so few women are tempted by the adoration of younger acolytes but often fall for superiors or mentors, while many otherwise happily married men become so intoxicated by admiration that they risk their careers and families for its temporary rush.
The challenge facing modern couples -- not just the men and women in these scandals -- is to root out our old psychological habits and incorporate our new expectations of love and marriage into our deepest emotional core.
