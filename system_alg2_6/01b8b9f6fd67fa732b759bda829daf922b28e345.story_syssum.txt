Baghdad (CNN) -- Violence across Iraq has claimed nine lives in the past two days, officials with the nation's interior ministry said Monday.
When the servicemember and firefighter responded, another roadside bomb exploded.
In the al-Taji district in Baghdad's northern outskirts, an Iraqi police officer was shot by gunmen while driving in a car Sunday afternoon, the officials said.
Others were wounded in attacks, interior ministry officials said.
However, assassinations, gunfire and bombs remain regular occurrences.
