Dolphins coach Joe Philbin suspended Incognito on Sunday night.
ESPN, NFL.com and other media outlets reported that representatives for Martin on Sunday submitted the voice mails and texts to the league and the Dolphins.
I'll (expletive) in your (expletive) mouth.
Martin left the team suddenly last week and has not commented publicly on why he walked away in the middle of the season.
The coach said representatives for Martin contacted the team on Sunday with their concerns.
Several media outlets said Martin had left the Dolphins because of bullying, something Incognito denied on Twitter.
The Miami Herald reported that a Dolphins source said Incognito is "done" with the team.
The NFL will review the case, league spokesman Greg Aiello said Monday.
"I think a lot of people think of hazing as being cruel, but I don't see anything like that in this locker room," he said.
"I know both of those guys personally," he said.
He said when Incognito joined the team, he would test people to see where he stood with them.
Still, former Dolphins running back Ricky Williams said it occurs less frequently in the NFL than most people think.
I don't think the media, I don't think fans, I don't think anyone outside is really in a position to really fully understand what occurs inside of a locker room and inside of a football team."
