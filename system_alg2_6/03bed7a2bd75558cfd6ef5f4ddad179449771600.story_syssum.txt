Florence, Italy (CNN) -- Amanda Knox vowed Friday to fight her conviction for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher "until the very end" and said she "will never go willingly" back to Italy.
But Simon said it was too early to talk about extradition since there is still an appeals process to go through, which will probably last another year.
And with a great deal of family support, they're going to go forward and appeal what we would characterize as a completely unjust conviction," Simon said.
Earlier Friday, Italian authorities stopped Sollecito near the border with Austria and Slovenia, Italian police told CNN.
Sollecito was sentenced to 25 years in prison.
Her sister, Stephanie Kercher, said the family might never know exactly what happened on the night of her death.
Stephanie Kercher said that she had been told of a letter written by Knox to the Kercher family but that she had not seen it.
Knox, who remained at home in Seattle, Washington, while the retrial was held, said in a written statement Thursday that her conviction would bring no consolation to the Kercher family.
