Atlanta (CNN) -- Atlanta's schools will flag suspicious test scores and achieve a culture of integrity in the wake of a cheating scandal that could lead to criminal charges against some principals and teachers, officials vowed Thursday.
Investigators said 178 teachers and principals working at 44 schools were involved in the cheating scandal.
The investigation's findings have been forwarded to the state teacher licensing board, Deal said.
"I do not accept a focus on performance causes people to cheat," Davis said.
Investigators compared the results with test results from other Georgia schools and found that such patterns did not occur normally, Deal said.
Marcia Klenbort, whose three children attended Atlanta Public Schools, said the school board failed to hold Hall accountable and did not adequately address the cheating before the state stepped in.
Administrators must ensure there are equal opportunities at all schools, she said, while parents must become more involved in their children's education -- both at school and home.
