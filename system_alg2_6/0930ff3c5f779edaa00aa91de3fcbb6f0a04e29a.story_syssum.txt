"No, no.
Just bed bugs.
Sort of.
But, from what I can tell, part of the fun in "Minecraft" is creating these new virtual worlds and exploring those of others.
Somehow, these vandals were able to infiltrate virtual Denmark while sneaking in virtual dynamite, at which point they virtually demolished parts of virtual Copenhagen.
But through their virtual sneak attack invasion, the vandals proudly constructed virtual American flags all over town, and built virtual signs reading: AMERICA.
I guess a man can dream.
The whole thing was just so absurd and wonderfully American.
