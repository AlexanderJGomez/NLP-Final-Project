The All Blacks and their fans are clear on one thing, says Dan Carter: the goal is to make history and become the first rugby nation to win back-to-back World Cups.
But, he says, the year ahead is about being ready for the challenge.
"I've been part of the squad that's won the World Cup before so, you know, that's a huge achievement," Carter says, diplomatically.
A year prior, at the same venue, England shocked New Zealand 38-21 to end the Kiwis' 20-match unbeaten run.
Lost one game there a couple of years ago but apart from that I've had a lot of success at Twickenham."
"The pinnacle of any rugby player is to reach those heights but to do it away from home, two tournaments in a row would be something pretty special," Carter said.
