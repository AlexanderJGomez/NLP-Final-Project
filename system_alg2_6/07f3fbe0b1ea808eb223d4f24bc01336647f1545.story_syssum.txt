Alleged cartel hit man Eduardo Ravelo has been added to the FBI's most wanted list.
He heads the Barrio Aztecas gang, but Ravelo isn't flashy, FBI agents say.
"Eduardo Ravelo rose to power within the Barrio Aztecas criminal enterprise because of his connections with the Juarez cartel and also [because] he's a ruthless killer and will basically carry out what the Juarez cartel wants him to do," Mikeska said.
U.S. authorities say the commanders of the Juarez cartel often call on Ravelo to execute their enemies.
In recent years, federal agents have arrested dozens of Barrio Aztecas' 3,500 members, with six of its leaders sentenced to life in prison.
While he may be staying out of sight, he's keeping up his violent work, Mikeska says, and he has the resources to do so.
