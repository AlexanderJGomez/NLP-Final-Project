They matched any gene variations they found in the DNA with study participants' individual symptoms.
A study published in July showed as many as 108 genes may be tied to the mental health disorder.
"In the past, scientists had been looking for associations between individual genes and schizophrenia," co-author Dr. Dragan Svrakic said in the statement.
The idea that schizophrenia is not one single disorder is not really new, says Dr. Charles Raison, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Arizona.
There may be 10 separate gene mutations, but they might only express themselves as one or two symptoms.
The same could hold true for schizophrenia and other mental health conditions, Raison says.
