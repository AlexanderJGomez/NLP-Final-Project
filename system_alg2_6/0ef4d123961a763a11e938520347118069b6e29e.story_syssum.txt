Or at least we assume it was clean, since Handler's final "Chelsea Lately" episode Tuesday included one of her infamous celebrity-accompanied shower scenes.
"No!"
Throughout "Chelsea Lately's" eight-season run, Handler has commandeered an unabashedly salty late night show, which on a typical night included a ring of celebrity trash-talking comedians and a celebrity interview that ran more bawdy than promotional.
"I want to thank every single person who's shown up for me in the last seven years," Handler said.
"Thank you to my family, and mom I hope you're watching me," Handler said in her goodbye speech.
