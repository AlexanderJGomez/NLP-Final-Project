Imran Khan, a former cricket star, this month led a march to the border of Pakistan's tribal region to protest drone strikes, which he says end up killing more civilians than militants.
A State Department official acknowledged that Khan was "briefly delayed" before boarding the next flight to the United States.
Khan says people he has spoken to in the tribal region say most of the people killed are innocent civilians.
