New York (CNN) -- A city official married the first couple in New York City to wed under the state's new law allowing same-sex marriage Sunday.
"These are two independent people who are joining together because they can see and they can feel how much better their lives will be," city clerk Michael McSweeney said as he married Siegal and Kopelov.
"Marriage equality is alive and well in every borough of New York City right now," said Christine Quinn, speaker of the New York City Council, who is also gay.
Marcos Chaljub and Freddy Zambrano were married after Siegal and Kopelov.
"We're just going to polish them up and exchange them again," Chaljub said.
"Is it this one?"
New York Rabbi Sharon Kleinbaum of Beit Simchat Torah congregation, who has lobbied for legalizing same-sex marriage, set up a station for couples desiring a religious ceremony after the civil one.
A handful of protesters were outside the city clerk's office in Manhattan Sunday morning.
