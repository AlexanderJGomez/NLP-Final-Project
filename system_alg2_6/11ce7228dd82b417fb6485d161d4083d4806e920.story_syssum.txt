The Mississippi River is not expected to return to its 43-foot flood stage in Vicksburg until after June 14, which is 46 days after it climbed out of its banks, said Amanda Roberts, a National Weather Service hydrologist.
Severe storms are likely Saturday and Sunday in the Mississippi River, Ohio River and Tennessee River valleys, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris.
We're probably 200 people more than we usually are," Monsour told CNN affiliate WJTV.
"(I'm) just here to celebrate the river cresting," Roland said.
Local officials caution that some area residents may have to wait to return to their homes.
The Mississippi River is more than 14 feet above flood stage at Vicksburg and more than a foot over the record set in the city in 1927.
A slide was detected on the mainline Mississippi levee at Albemarle Lake, the Corps of Engineers said Thursday.
So far, the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development has delivered nearly 150,000 sandbags, 30,000 cubic yards of sand and 33,000 linear feet of fabric-lined baskets, the governor's office said.
It will be weeks before the river falls below flood stage, allowing evacuees to return.
The flood is the most significant to hit the lower Mississippi River valley since at least 1937.
