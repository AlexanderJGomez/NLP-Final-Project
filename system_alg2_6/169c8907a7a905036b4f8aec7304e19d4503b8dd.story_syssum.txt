On Monday -- the deadline for the letter, according to the teen -- the Shawnee Mission School District issued a statement stating that "she is not required to write a letter of apology to the governor."
"I had no idea what it was about or why I was being called into the office," she said.
The principal then asked her to write a letter of apology to Brownback and his staff.
"I don't think I should write the letter, and I don't think it would be the best move for me," she said.
At the least, the student said that she hopes the controversy surrounding her tweet will bring attention to the issue of free speech.
"I hope there won't be any consequences and that my principal and the governor's office can move on," she said.
