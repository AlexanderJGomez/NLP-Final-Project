As the opening of next month's Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, approaches, the controversies surrounding the games seem to accumulate by the day.
Russia killed around 1.5 million Circassians and expelled a similar number, mostly to the Ottoman Empire, with many dying of famine and disease.
The Circassians found it intolerable not only that Sochi was selected to host the Olympics, but also that Russia did not seem to acknowledge that Circassians even lived there.
Then, for the first time in history, the native peoples of the area were made official hosts of the Olympics and were involved in every aspect of the games.
Putin can also push for an acknowledgement of the Circassians at the opening ceremony and speak on the issue.
It is impossible to bring back the mass numbers of Circassians killed at Sochi and the surrounding region in the 19th century.
