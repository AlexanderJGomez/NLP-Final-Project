The deal brokered by Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell does make good on President Obama's promise to bring a little more equity to the tax code by raising rates on wealthier Americans, and it temporarily averts the most draconian "sequestration" cuts.
Just as bad, or perhaps worse in terms of the day-to-day lives of average people, the bill only postpones the forced cuts of sequestration by two months, to precisely the moment the country will be engaged in another ruinous debate about lifting our national debt ceiling to ensure the country can pay its bills.
The head of the AFL-CIO, Richard Trumka, said the deal "sets the stage for more hostage taking."
The deal that was hastily cobbled together actually increases our deficit, and it creates an even bigger potential crisis just weeks from now.
One -- the one Washington will focus on -- is "who is to blame?"
One party speaks on behalf of one set of interests.
Both sides decided not to address it during the political campaign.
The two-party system is a boon for America when it is seen as providing a voice for two parts of a unified whole.
But then again, I never imagined a situation in Washington so dangerous to the well-being of so many Americans.
