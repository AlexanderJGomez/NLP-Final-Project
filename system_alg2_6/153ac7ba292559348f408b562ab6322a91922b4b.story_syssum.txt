As evacuees from last year's Fukushima nuclear disaster, Mikio and Hamako lost everything: their home, their jobs, and any hope for the future.
In a landmark case, Watanabe filed a lawsuit last month against TEPCO, blaming the utility company for his wife's suicide.
Watanabe wants TEPCO to compensate and treat victims for a man-made accident, which would expedite how the company cares for evacuees.
"We talked a lot then," recalls Watanabe.
"The next morning, I woke up early around 4 a.m.
Watanabe continued to weed around his house and went inside to take a shower.
Watanabe says it's strange what you remember in trauma.
"We lost everything," he says.
I lost my wife in such a terrible way.
Due to the size of the affected area, TEPCO and the Japanese government are unable to estimate if and when residents will ever be able to return.
