Morris was last seen by a friend, who walked her to a parking garage at the Shops at Legacy mall just before 4 a.m., but he did not walk her all the way to her car, police said.
She appears on surveillance video walking into the parking garage with the friend, police said.
"I'm worried sick and will do anything to get any information on the last time anyone has seen or talked to her please help and pray that she is ok," he said in a posting Tuesday.
Plano authorities are asking for the public's help in locating Morris, who is described as 5 feet 4 inches tall, with blond hair and brown eyes, weighing 100 pounds.
