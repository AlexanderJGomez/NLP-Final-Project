(CNN) -- Heavy rain, hilly terrain and inadequate equipment slowed efforts to recover hundreds of people feared killed by a massive landslide in eastern Uganda, officials said Thursday.
The terrain also is inaccessible by road, Ecweru said.
A select few attended the service, because of the risk of more landslides, Ecweru said.
"We have not found anyone alive today," Ntabadde said.
The landslide occurred near Mount Elgon, on the Kenya-Uganda border.
