Oscar Hernandez was found guilty on five felony charges for the misappropriation of funds stemming from his years as Bell's mayor, by the same jury that also convicted four former city council members on various counts.
The split verdicts for Hernandez, Teresa Jacobo, George Mirabal, George Cole and Victor Bello came two and a half years after the Los Angeles Times first reported salaries for them and others were well above the norm -- especially considering that Bell, situated about 10 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, is a relatively small city of 36,000 people.
Except for Artiga, the jury found the defendants guilty of misappropriation of funds for "payment of services as (members) of the Solid Waste and Recycling Authority."
Hernandez's lawyer, Stanley Friedman, told reporters after the verdicts Wednesday that his client didn't knowingly break the law.
"At this point, ... we're ready as a community and as a city to really move on."
