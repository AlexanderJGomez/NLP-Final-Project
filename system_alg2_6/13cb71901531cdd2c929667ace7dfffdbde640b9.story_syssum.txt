ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan understands the need to move "urgently and transparently" against extremists on its soil after last week's terrorist attacks in India, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said after meetings with Pakistani leaders.
Rice's visit to Islamabad came a day after Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, met with Zardari and top military and intelligence officials in Islamabad.
"So far as the government of India is concerned, what action will be taken by government will depend on the response we have from Pakistan authorities," Mukherjee said.
U.S. Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen warned Thursday of the "increasingly sophisticated threat of militant extremism in South Asia," and urged India and Pakistan to collaborate against a common enemy.
