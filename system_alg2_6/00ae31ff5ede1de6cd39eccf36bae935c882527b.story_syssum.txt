BEIJING, China (CNN) -- The head of China's quality watchdog is reported to have resigned over the tainted baby milk scandal that has killed four children and sickened nearly 53,000 others.
The scandal has spread beyond the mainland with melamine being found in three Chinese-made dairy products in Singapore.
Taiwan announced Monday it was banning the importation of all dairy products from China because of melamine contamination in milk supplies on the mainland, Taiwan's Health Ministry said Monday.
Investigators arrested two brothers who sold milk used to produce the contaminated baby milk powder last week.
The raw milk had been watered down and the chemical added to fool quality checks, the newspaper said.
