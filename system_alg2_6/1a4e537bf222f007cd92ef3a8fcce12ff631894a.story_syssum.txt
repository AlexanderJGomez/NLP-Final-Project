Hong Kong (CNN) -- This is the story of two entrepreneurs with two very different interests.
He networked with friends, brainstormed and came up with a business idea that embraced his passion: martial arts.
Two and a half years later, Legend has carved a niche for itself in the mixed martial arts world.
Maximilian von Poelnitz found a problem and started a business to solve it.
He and two friends came up with the concept for Secret Ingredient, a delivery service of fresh ingredients for ready-to-cook dishes with the cooking instructions included.
After about 250 test meals -- mostly with friends -- Secret Ingredient launched last fall in Hong Kong.
What made Haskamp believe investors would buy into the niche idea of setting up mixed martial arts fights and that the public would pay good money to see a fight?
Von Poelnitz says, "I think in our case, the timing and all the chips kind of fell into place.
"We don't have very much of an advertising budget," says von Poelnitz.
"Being in the food business, holidays are your big enemy which seems counterintuitive," says von Poelnitz.
I trusted myself and ultimately, I think it's paid off," says Haskamp.
