It capped a remarkable few months for Chelsea, who sacked Portuguese manager Andre Villas Boas in late March with the team toiling in the Premier League and trailing 3-1 against Napoli after the first leg of their Champions League last 16 match.
The win also guaranteed Chelsea a place in the Champions League next season after missing out via the Premier League by only finishing sixth.
As the Chelsea fans celebrated, the mood in Munich was predictably somber.
"It's like a nightmare," Bayern director of sport Christian Nerlinger said.
