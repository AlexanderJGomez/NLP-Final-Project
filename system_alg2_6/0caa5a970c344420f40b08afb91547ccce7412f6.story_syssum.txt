(CNN) -- A jet lagged Serena Williams skipped any New Year celebrations for a good night's sleep after starting her 2014 WTA campaign in Brisbane Tuesday with a win over Andrea Petkovic.
Former top 10 player Petkovic proved a strong opponent for a season-opener and Williams dropped her service early in the match.
Despite her desire for some shut eye, Williams will be hoping to have got back to more regular sleep patterns after only flying into Australia Saturday ahead of the tournament.
The Russian superstar will now advance to the quarterfinals, where she will play 2012 champion Kaia Kanepi of Estonia.
