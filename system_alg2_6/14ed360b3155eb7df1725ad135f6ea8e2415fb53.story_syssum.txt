Taylor recalls: "He turned to me and said, 'Simon, I do think perhaps I've written quite a good book here.'
"In some ironic way, it (his death) got a little bit more attention for the book in the UK," says Morgan Entrekin, president of Grove/Atlantic, Sussman's U.S. publisher, "as people wrote about the tragedy of his death and the fact that this was going to be his last book."
His widow didn't finish his latest book until after his death last year.
Each book includes a character called Alexandra (Alicky's full name).
"I think one of the really, really difficult things about losing someone is the conversation ending," Alicky says.
His agent says she has a manuscript Sussman wrote more than 10 years ago.
Susijn says the unpublished manuscript reflects its author even more than his subsequent novels, largely because it's so funny.
His literary team also worries that introducing a new work too soon after his latest crime thriller's release could distract readers from the marketing campaign around his existing books.
"For me, he's very much alive," Susijn says.
"He knew how to tell a rip-roaring story," says Taylor of Transworld Publishers.
