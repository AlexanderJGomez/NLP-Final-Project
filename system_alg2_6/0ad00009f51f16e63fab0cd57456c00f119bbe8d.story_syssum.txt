Ford and Mazda said 591,245 vehicles were potentially affected, according to the automakers' reports to the NHTSA in 2004.
The 2004 Ford and Mazda recalls were for the vehicle speed control cables in their affected vehicles.
The NHTSA has opened the investigation to assess "the scope, frequency and safety-related consequences of the alleged defect," the agency said.
Neither Ford nor Mazda responded to CNN's requests for comment.
