Roswell, New Mexico (CNN) -- A skydiver's historic free-fall from the stratosphere was called off Tuesday due to wind gusts that ruined the helium balloon set to hoist him to high altitude for the record-breaking attempt.
"There's a lot riding on that, so the main thing for us is making sure the probability is very high," Thompson said.
The attempt has serious risks.
While reaching such speeds can cause stress on an aircraft, planners for this jump believe there will be little effect on Baumgartner because he will be at an altitude at which there is so little air that shock waves are barely transmitted.
You know, I'm living a good life.
BASE is an acronym for buildings, antennas, spans and Earth -- the four things from which you can jump.
Cameras on the ground and on the capsule will transmit live images of his attempt.
The record for such a jump is currently held by Col. Joe Kittinger, who in 1960 jumped from 102,800 feet as part of a U.S. Air Force mission.
For example, he described what it feels like to fall through space when there is so little air: "There's no way you can tell how fast you're going, because there's no visual cues."
