Four people died when they contracted listeriosis after consuming celery that had been processed at the SanGar plant, said Carrie Williams, a department spokeswoman.
The listeria found in samples "matches the DNA fingerprint of the clinical cases of listeriosis reported by the Texas Department of State Health Services," the FDA said in a statement.
"The FDA and the state have not turned over to us the documentation supporting their findings," Galvan said.
State health inspectors said they believe the bacteria found in the chopped celery may have contaminated other products at the company's plant.
Besides the bacteria, inspectors found a condensation leak above a food product area, dirt on a food-preparation table, and hand-washing problems at the San Antonio plant, the state health department said.
The Texas health department is taking the lead in the investigation, with assistance from the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC.
