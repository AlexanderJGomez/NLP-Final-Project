Vehicle mounted electronic jammers attempt to block a signal going to a radio-controlled IED.
Jamming devices, known as Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare, or CREW systems, attempt to intercept or block a signal before it reaches its intended target, preventing detonation.

IEDs are the No.
Most roadside bombs are remotely detonated using common household devices: cell phones, garage door openers, burglar alarms, key fobs, doorbells, or remote controls for toy cars.
As insurgents modify their devices to outwit the military, the military in turn adapts its own jamming technologies.
One in six IEDs causes casualties in Iraq, JIEDDO reports.
JIEDDO said it is aggressively going after the bomb makers, working to destroy their networks.
"The best way to counter the IED threat is through understanding the network that allows an IED to even be assembled," said Marks, who supports JIEDDO's work.
