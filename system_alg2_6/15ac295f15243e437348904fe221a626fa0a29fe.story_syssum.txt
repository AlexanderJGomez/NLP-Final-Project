That, however, is the only time in the movie that Cameron uses 3-D to conjure a comin'-at-ya View-Master effect.
Of course, that might also be because no movie ever needed 3-D less than "Titanic."
That's "Titanic."
There are two ways that it now looks different -- and, if anything, they're both examples of how a movie can age almost karmically well.
Some have called it callow, but I implore you to go back and see Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in this movie and watch how dazzlingly spontaneous and multi-faceted their chemistry is.
In recent years, a hint of off-putting harshness has crept into Winslet's work (in "Revolutionary Road" and "Mildred Pierce," she did too much gloomy suffering for our sins), but in "Titanic" she plays Rose as a spiky princess, trapped by privilege, who allows herself to melt like a girl and, in doing so, melts her own prison and finds herself as a woman.
To watch "Titanic" again is to do nothing less than enter a movie and come out the other side, with one's spirit feeling just a little bit larger.
