The icon -- which Twitter users call it the "fail whale" because the creature appears only when the site has failed to load -- has gained a cult following as the social media site grows at breakneck pace.
With all of those new Twitterers, fail whale sightings and site crashes seem more frequent.
"We're all trying to do a lot of things that seem pretty impossible," Bill said.
"I keep getting the fail whale.
The site used to feel "insulated" from the mainstream, and now it doesn't, he said.
Early users see new people coming to the site, and that creeps them out, but it shouldn't, she said.
That's what we do," she said.
Twitter says it is addressing breakdowns in that wired communication.
Bill, whose fail whale parties have featured an aquamarine martini in honor of the icon's color, said the whale's popularity comes from the idea that failures are worth celebrating and learning from.
"Twitter is a powerful enough thing that it should succeed in a broad way, and I would like it to succeed in a broad way," he said.
