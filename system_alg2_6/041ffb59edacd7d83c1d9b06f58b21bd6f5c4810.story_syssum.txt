While the majority of the 15,000 crowd packed inside Court Philippe Chatrier roared their home favorite Gael Monfils at every opportunity, their hopes of a French champion were extinguished once again.
The World No.8, who was so impressive during his victory over Spain's Fernando Verdasco, looks to be far more comfortable with his game following a troublesome back injury.
The third was more competitive with the home crowd urging the World No.28 to respond and take the contest into a fourth set.
He swept Monfils away with disdain -- 6-0 to secure the match, finish the contest and throw down the gauntlet to his next opponent -- champion Rafael Nadal.
After a slow start in which he conceded the first set 6-4, Nadal hit back to take the next three sets 6-4 6-0 6-1.
Petkovic, who is the first German lady to reach the semifinals since Steffi Graf in 1999, now faces a showdown with Romania's Simona Halep.
I played really well and stuck to my gameplan," she told reporters.
I played very fast.
