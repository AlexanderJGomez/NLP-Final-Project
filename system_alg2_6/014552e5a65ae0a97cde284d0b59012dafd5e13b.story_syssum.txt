The case fueled years of debate about whether the hapless Wells had been the victim of a heinous murder or a willing participant in a horrifically botched crime.
"They screwed up big time," Heid said.
The FBI believes a Stockton associate, William Rothstein, was the mastermind of the heist and likely made the bomb, the affidavit says.
According to the FBI affidavit, one of the admitted conspirators said Stockton carried the bomb out of Rothstein's garage on the day of the robbery and handed it to Rothstein.
According to an FBI agent's court affidavit, Barnes told authorities that Wells had been discussing the hold up about a month before it took place.
At first, the FBI saw Wells as a victim.
On September 21, Rothstein called Pennsylvania State Police to report that there was a body in his freezer -- the body of a man named James Roden, whom he said was killed because he was going to report the bomb plot to authorities, according to the FBI affidavit.
After her arrest, Diehl-Armstrong implicated Rothstein in the bomb plot, and she eventually told investigators she gunned down Roden when he threatened to go to police about the plan.
He's the one Wells' sister wants brought to justice.
And Jim Fisher, a retired FBI agent and writer, told CNN that he believes Wells was murdered as part of the plot.
