Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova were released about two months before their prison sentences were due to end.
But Tolokonnikova, released from a Siberian facility on Monday, told CNN she felt that the amnesty was a publicity stunt to bolster the government's image before it hosts the Winter Olympics in February.
She said Monday that she is eager to help Russian prisoners by calling attention to conditions they face.
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a former oil tycoon and Kremlin critic, was released from a lengthy period in prison last week after a pardon from Putin.
He was due for release next year.
