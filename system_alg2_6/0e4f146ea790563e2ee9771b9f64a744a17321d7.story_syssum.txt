Waits' position on the periphery of pop music (he admits that the 60s scene largely passed him by), may be because he belongs to a bigger historical tradition -- that of the singer-storyteller that has its origin in folk music.
Waits' place in the folk tradition is something he has acknowledged, consciously or otherwise, in his music.
he moved to Los Angeles in the late sixties to pursue his music career, finding work as a doorman at an LA nightspot.
"Bukowski had a story that essentially was saying that it's the little things that drive men mad," Waits said.
Waits took to the stage dressed in a Chaplinesque suit, delivering his set from a slightly raised platform that gave up a cloud of dust each time he bashed his feet into it.
Lopsided or not, it's an authentic voice we could surely do with hearing more from.
