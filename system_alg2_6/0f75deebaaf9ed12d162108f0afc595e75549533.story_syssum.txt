Russia maximized its deliveries of men and arms to East Ukraine in August and September to coincide with one peak of the crisis in Iraq.
So is the issue of why so many left the UK to fight in the first place.
Russia hasn't finished, even in Ukraine.
Russia also wants Ukraine to fail.
And if Ukraine does fail to transform itself, it will be only one in a string of dysfunctional states ringing the EU.
Ukraine also has a humanitarian crisis; the official estimate for IDPs by the UNHCR was already 445,000 by 10 November.
Russia has been causing problems within the EU for years.
Specific propaganda messages about Russia or Ukraine are then buried in the post-modern melange.
But Ukraine has to get there first, with the risk of further crises and renewed conflict very real.
