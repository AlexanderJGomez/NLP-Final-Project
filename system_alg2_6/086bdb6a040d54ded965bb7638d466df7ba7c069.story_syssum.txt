On Thursday, French president Francois Hollande told a delegation of professional French football club leaders he wouldn't abandon the government's plan for a 75% tax on salaries reaching more than a $1.35 million.
If it goes ahead it would France's first football "strike" since 1972.
But PSG could be at a further disadvantage in future given Monaco are exempt from French taxation laws and the principality club's tax expenditure would be $67.5 million less than the French champions per year.
"French teams will be at a disadvantage with regard to English clubs who only pay 40% tax," former Monaco chief executive Tor-Kristian Karlsen told CNN.
"In the short term clubs would have to buy cheaper players for lower transfers and would pay lower salaries to avoid paying the 75%," said Karlsen as he outlined a grim future for French football.
And given France's economic problems -- it has only just emerged from recession -- some members of the French football community remain uneasy about the proposed strike.
