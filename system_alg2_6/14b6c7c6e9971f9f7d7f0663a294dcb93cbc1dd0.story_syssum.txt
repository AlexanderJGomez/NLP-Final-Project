(Health.com) -- People who take vitamin E supplements regularly for years -- whether they are smokers or nonsmokers -- may lower their risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the lung condition that is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States.
Vitamin E did not lower the risk of asthma, a condition associated with a higher risk of COPD.
Several studies have shown that these vitamins, as well as vitamin D, may help improve lung health.
Currently, no vitamin supplements are recommended to prevent or treat COPD.
The vitamin E intake in the study was far higher, at 300 IU per day.
For people concerned about their lung health, taking vitamin E and C is not a bad idea, says Blumberg.
Two studies found that beta-carotene supplements increased the risk of lung cancer in people who smoked more than one pack a day and drank heavily.
