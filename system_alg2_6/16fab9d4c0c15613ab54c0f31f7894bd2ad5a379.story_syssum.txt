Officials say Joe Saenz is thought to be linked with Mexican drug cartels.
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Detective Traci Gonzales knew there were drug and gang ties to the slaying, so she showed the videotape to Los Angeles Police Department Detective Ron Chavarria, a veteran on the gang beat.
Saenz is the newest person on the FBI's Most Wanted List, after three fugitives on the list were recently caught.
"Just gruesome, gruesome, cold-blooded," Chavarria said.
"He's believed to be linked with the cartels in Mexico, bringing large amounts of narcotics into the Los Angeles area, Garriola said.
The chilling video, Chavarria said, shows why Saenz is so dangerous.
