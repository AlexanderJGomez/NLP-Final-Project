The wireless giant announced a multibillion-dollar deal to purchase rights to largely unused spectrum, which is like an open lane on the congested wireless Internet highway.
Unlike the proposed AT&T/T-Mobile merger, Verizon's acquisition doesn't involve taking millions of subscribers from a competitor, thereby increasing concentration in the wireless market.
If Washington were so inclined, it could free up a ton of spectrum for more valuable uses.
So AT&T and Verizon, the No.
But the merger seems to face implacable opposition from the trust-busters at the Justice Department and the micromanagers at the FCC.
And neither apparently puts much weight on AT&T's need for additional spectrum if it is to offer viable competition for Verizon in a 4G world.
Does that mean giving AT&T and Verizon free passes?
But it would mean a change in priorities at Justice and the FCC in which the agencies use their legal leverage to minimize concentration in regional wireless markets without undermining the potential for more efficient use of spectrum.
