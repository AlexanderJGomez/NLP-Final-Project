Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- South Africans in the emerging middle class are becoming savvy consumers, now concerned with brands.
This is called below-the-line marketing and the target market is the lower-end consumer.
Zonal champions will inform and educate members of the emerging middle class in South Africa on what to buy, and why they should buy it.
Vodacom is one of The Creative Counsel's clients; it too utilizes zonal champions to spread its marketing message to consumers who are hard to reach.
She says that her community members sometimes call her Miss Vodacom, because she represents the brand.
Apart from bridging the gap between the big multinational and the consumer this marketing strategy also provides employment opportunities for South Africans.
"It means that if you're a brand that needs to support me in the community, create employment opportunities, gives me real product information, I will support you and buy your product -- one hand washes the other.
