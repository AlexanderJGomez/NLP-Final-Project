Sheridan, 48, returns to the stand Friday after testifying all day Thursday in her legal battle with Cherry and ABC over the TV killing of a character she played on the hit comedy series for five seasons.
Sheridan testified that while she explained her concerns to Cherry, the producer asked "What is it that you want?"
Cherry apologized to her soon after the hitting incident, telling her "I am on bended knee begging for your forgiveness," Sheridan testified.
The next day, she told show producer George Perkins she wanted a second apology and flowers from Cherry.
Sheridan lawyers Mark Baute, in his opening statement Wednesday, challenge the authenticity of those writers notes, accusing Cherry's defense of an "effort to backdate the decision" with a fake story that the character's death was planned months before the hitting incident.
Cherry assured her that her character would "be saved" in the next episode at the start of season four, she said.
The character was not initially intended to be on the show beyond the pilot episode, but Cherry decided to make her the "blond bombshell who would sleep with the husbands of all of the wives," he said.
The human resources investigator never interviewed Cherry or Sheridan about the incident, only three people who worked for Cherry, Baute said.
