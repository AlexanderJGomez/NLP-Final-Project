"I was told that no matter how difficult I found the load to bear, I needed to follow the law or suffer eternal consequences," said Wanda Barzee about her husband, Brian Mitchell.
"No," Barzee responded.
Mitchell told her prior to the Smart abduction "that I needed to take seven wives into my heart and home," Barzee said, adding that the news upset her greatly.
On June 4, 2002, the night of the abduction, she and Mitchell fought, Barzee said.
Mitchell faces life in prison if he is convicted of kidnapping and transporting a minor across state lines for sexual purposes.
