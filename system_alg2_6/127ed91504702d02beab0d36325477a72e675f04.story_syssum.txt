Did you slip into a slim-fitting pair of tailored trousers, like Drew Barrymore?
Shorts are finally getting respect outside the park -- at the office, at dinner, and even on the red carpet, seen on the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Connelly.
Better put a sock in it now, or rather you may wind up putting one on with your stacked heel like Leighton Meester.
There's no equivocating about this option.
They offer more variety while providing the same impact.
