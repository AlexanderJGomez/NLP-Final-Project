San Diego, California (CNN) -- President Obama deserves an A+ for his agenda for education reform.
Obama's not having any of it.
3) Those intent on preserving the status quo resist tooth and nail any attempt to hold them accountable by linking teachers to the performance of their students or, in an idea that Louisiana is trying and that Duncan smiles upon and would like to see spread to other states, tracing back teachers to the schools of education that produced them.
They just want a constant foil, someone to blame when students flounder and the schools underperform.
I bet that a lot of public school teachers -- many of whom, according to exit polls, vote Democratic -- are already missing the Bush administration.
Trouble is, this week, Obama made clear that, when it comes to fixing our schools, he and the education secretary are on the same team.
