Sandy was forecast with remarkable precision.
Many aspects of the immediate government response to Sandy were also successful.
It was clear for years that the New York City subways were dangerously vulnerable to hurricane flooding.
The consequences of poor planning will become all the more serious as climate warms and sea level rises.
Floods like Sandy's will become more common as sea level rises.
Rain-driven floods like those in Colorado a few weeks ago will also happen more often, as warmer air holds more water vapor.
The changes are already under way, results of human greenhouse gas emissions, and consistent with the predictions of climate scientists decades ago.
We need to convince them to take the climate change forecast equally seriously.
