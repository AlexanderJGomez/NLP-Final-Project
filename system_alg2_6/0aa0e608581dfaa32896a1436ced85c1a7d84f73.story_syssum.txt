Police found human remains in Aron's freezer and a trash bin which they believe are those of the boy, who went missing Monday afternoon.
Police said Aron, 35, made statements Wednesday implicating himself in the death of Kletzky.
Aron claims he took Kletzky to a wedding Monday night in Monsey, New York, and then brought him back, Kelly said.
Police said Aron went to the wedding, but have not been able to confirm that Kletzky actually went with him, as no one has said they've seen him.
Kelly said that statements made by the suspect indicated that he kidnapped Kletzky and, as a neighborhood search for the boy intensified, he became panicked and killed him.
"Even as I talked to him not long ago, everything was fine, no indications that anything was wrong."
