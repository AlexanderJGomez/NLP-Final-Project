She may be a celeb, but Poehler isn't too big to take it to YouTube with her Amy Poehler's Smart Girls series, where she interviews interesting women and answers questions from fans.
But while Fey has two daughters, Poehler has two sons.
The Golden Globes organizers were smart enough to lock Fey and Poehler in to a two-year contract to host the show.
