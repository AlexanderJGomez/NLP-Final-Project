Although a judge has found two Steubenville teenagers guilty of raping a 16-year-old girl in a case that showcased jaw-dropping examples of teenage alcohol use and tawdry text messaging -- all wrapped in allegations of a cover-up -- Ohio's attorney general said Monday it's now time for a grand jury to look at whether anyone else should be charged.
The girls -- one 15, one 16, both from Steubenville -- were in a juvenile lockup Monday night, awaiting an appearance before a judge Tuesday morning, Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla said.
But 16 people who may know something about what happened that August night have refused to talk, he said.
DeWine's announcement of the grand jury came shortly after Judge Thomas Lipps found Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, guilty of rape.
Both Mays and Richmond must undergo treatment and will have to register as sex offenders, Lipps ruled.
"She continues to be a victim and be victimized ... over and over," he said.
"But the attorney general had just left the building -- the judge was still in the building -- when I received messages that there's death threats already against the victim."
The case received widespread attention after a blogger who once lived in Steubenville uncovered some of the materials posted to social media sites.
"It's not.
DeWine said.
