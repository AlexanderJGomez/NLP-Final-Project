London, England (VBS.TV) -- In April this year I embedded with the elite soldiers of the 2nd Battalion British Parachute Regiment at their training facility in Thetford, United Kingdom.
Perhaps more shocking than the horrific injuries the soldiers had sustained was the lack of support of these men from the British government of the time -- particularly those who suffered psychological problems as a result of combat shock.

A week before we set off for the embed, I asked Stuart what kind of experience we were letting ourselves in for and he said: "Not only are the Parachute Regiment Britain's most elite soldiers, they are the most brutal of British troops.
I remember it was in Helmand 2006 that Afghanistan became very hairy indeed.
Richard talked to us about his love for the army and for war.
With the help of my co-producer Jason Mojica, we packed two small cameras into our bags and traveled to the middle of the British countryside to try and ingratiate ourselves with the most brutal soldiers in the whole of the British army.
Then the sergeant major introduced himself and told us to get in line with the rest of the troops.
And off we marched into the night.
