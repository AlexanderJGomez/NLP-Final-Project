That's why scientists and NASA are eagerly searching for "exoplanets" -- that is, planets that orbit around stars other than our sun.
Say hello to the three new exoplanets: Kepler 62e and Kepler 62f orbit are the fifth and sixth planets orbiting the star Kepler 62, and Kepler 69c is the third planet orbiting -- you guessed it -- Kepler 69.
(By "year" I mean the time that a planet takes to orbit its star.
Since Kepler 62 is a cooler star than our sun, planets can orbit closer to it than the Earth can to our sun before overheating.
We don't know for sure whether there is life on Venus or Mars.
The Kepler satellite was designed to look for planets around each of about 100,000 stars.
We have had the technology to explore space and to communicate over long distances for less than 100 years -- a tiny fraction of the few million years since the first humans, much less the 4.5 billion years since the Earth formed.
It is only a matter of time before we know if the galaxy is home to a multitude of planets like Earth, or if we are a rarity."
He asked whether life might exist on one of these planets, and whether we could visit them.
