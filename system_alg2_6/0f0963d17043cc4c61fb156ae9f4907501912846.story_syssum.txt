But can they detect cancer?
The idea of using thermograms to ferret out abnormally growing cells is already being used with an imaging device that takes a temperature reading of breast tissue.
Even if the readings provide a positive result, and if, as the company says, the tumors are at their earliest stages and barely detectable as a mass, it's not clear what doctors can do for women at that point.
So while the idea of wearing a sports bra for 12 hours to detect breast cancer certainly sounds appealing, the bra may be a bit ahead of itself.
"We really need to have more solid data before we start adding on tests, especially when we have tests [like the mammogram, MRI and ultrasound]," says Bevers.
