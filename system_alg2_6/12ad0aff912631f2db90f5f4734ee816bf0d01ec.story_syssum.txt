It escaped no one that a similar scene played out 20 months earlier when the Concordia first came to rest on the rocky shores.
Habib, himself a salvage master, stepped aside while the star of this particular show, Nick Sloane, the 52-year-old South African in charge of the Concordia salvage, and his key team took center stage.
Many of the salvage workers sat at the outdoor tables, just like they do after every shift and wondered just what all the fuss was about.
Many of them lined the hills above the wreck with binoculars and time-lapse cameras to capture the event.
It was a surreal scene, and one made even more poignant by the fact that the other half of the ship was still pristine white, almost as if the ship was wearing a half-white, half-black masquerade mask.
There was nothing to do but stare.
