He and Dolores Huerta co-founded what's now known as the United Farm Workers.
Without Chavez, California's farm workers wouldn't have fair wages, lunch breaks and access to toilets or clean water in the fields.

Kennedy is urging the passing of the Farmworkers Fair Labor Practices Act, which would give farm workers the right to one day of rest each week, time-and-a-half pay for work past an eight-hour day, as well as unemployment, workers' compensation and disability insurance.
It's to give people a 'day on' because we have a responsibility to provide service to our communities," United Farm Workers president  Arturo Rodriguez told CNN.
Right now, Cesar Chavez Day is recognized only in California, Texas and Colorado.
We even had people that were killed in the movement but we were still able to organize," Huerta said.
"Well, first Cesar didn't want to spend the time making the film because there was so much work to do, and he was hesitant on being singled out because there were so many others that contributed to the UFW's success," said Rodriguez.
"I hope young people use the power of social media to help spread the word about social change," Dawson said.
