"I was looking for a way to do a performance with a robot, and I was like 'hey, what about a comedy routine on stage?'
The unlikely partnership between researcher and robot is not without friction -- at one stage Ginger informs us Knight has been "cheating" on it.
"People love when it goes all super-techy and acts like a real robot.

"When the robot makes fun of me, it means I can tell you about my research and it's like my own self-deprecation," explained the bubbly engineer, and you get the feeling her popularity is not just down to Ginger, but her own charismatic stage presence.
Boom!
