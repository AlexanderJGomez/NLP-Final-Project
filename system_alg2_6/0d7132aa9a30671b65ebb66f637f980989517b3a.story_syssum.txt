President Obama's decision to target militants from ISIS -- which is now calling itself the "Islamic State" or "IS" -- operating in Iraq comes as a huge relief to the Iranians.
At first, there was nothing but silence in Tehran as U.S. F-18s on Friday began to target ISIS militants.
This was the first time since the U.S .airstrikes began that a senior Iranian official has spoken in such terms.
They are also in agreement that Iraq above all needs a new political leadership and that Prime Minister Maliki has to go.
The fact is that Shamkhani was himself heavily involved in recent weeks to seek out an alternative to Maliki, including a trip he made to Iraq in late July to consult with various Iraqi political circles.
As far as the U.S. role in combating the Islamic State is concerned, the Iranian debate is likely to remain split between the moderates and the hawks.
But all the recent trends suggest that the moderate viewpoint in Tehran has the upper hand on the policy question of Iraq and how Iran can best serve its interests.
Time will show if Rouhani and his moderate wing can continue to sit in the driver's seat on the question of Iraq.
