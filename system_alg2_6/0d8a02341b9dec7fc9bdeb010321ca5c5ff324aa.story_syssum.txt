Now Jay-Z charts his escape from the hard-knock life, describes the reunion that healed the wounds of his childhood -- and even reveals his personal creed.
Jay-Z spoke with Oprah Winfrey about his father, his anger and his old life.
Oprah: Wow.
They just wake up one day and their dad is gone.
I also felt protective of my mom.
But I felt I had to make the situation better.
Oprah: I've read that when you were 12, you shot your brother in the shoulder.
He was doing a lot of drugs.
I was saying, "You know, Ma, I've really been trying to look inward, and maybe I'm just not meant to fall in love like other people do."
And I guess I still had too much resentment and anger.
So when my mom set up this meeting, I told her he wouldn't come -- and the first time, he didn't.
Oprah: The second time, your father showed up.
I'm like, "I was a kid!
You can't do that."
And my dad was in so much pain that he started using drugs and became a different person.
Jay-Z: Pretty much.
Jay-Z: Be true to yourself -- and keep things simple.
Jay-Z: As a kid, I didn't know any better.
Do you still think back on that time in your life?
