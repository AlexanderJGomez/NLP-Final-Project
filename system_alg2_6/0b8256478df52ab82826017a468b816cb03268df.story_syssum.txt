Salt spreaders and plows rumbled through Arlington, where sub-freezing temperatures hung in the air amid a mix of debilitating sleet and snow that canceled hundreds of flights Friday, raising questions about whether the Super Bowl host was ready for the rash of inclement weather.
Ice and snow slid off the stadium roof Friday and caused injuries to workers below, authorities said.
One man was struck in the head by ice and was in stable condition at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, said Lt. Pedro Arevalo of the Arlington Fire Department.
"We have been planning for this for a whole year," Librio said of Sunday's match-up between the Green Bay Packers and the Pittsburgh Steelers.
Sunday's game, Super Bowl XLV, is scheduled to begin at 6:30 p.m ET.
