(CNN) -- It all started on my second date with Alex.
On what had to be the coldest night in the history of the ball drop, we shivered next to each other waiting patiently, with a few thousand spectators, to get one year closer to the millennium.
In the back of my mind, I knew Alex's race would pose a problem for my family.
My mom, who moved to New York from Iowa, was indifferent on race but wasn't about to challenge my dad's way of thinking.
When I met Alex, it sounds corny, but I never saw a color -- I just saw Alex.
Then my dad walked away.
"Do you want to be a big mama ... barefoot and pregnant for the rest of your life?
In my mind, I was just dating Alex.
Alex felt helpless, livid at being judged by a handshake and his skin color, but he knew it didn't have anything to do with him.
I knew Alex was "the one," and I wasn't about to let my racist father get in the way of my happiness.
We even moved in together, and for years my parents were none the wiser.
My colleagues knew what was going on and encouraged me to talk to my dad again, this time as a strong adult woman who was succeeding in a career and no longer financially dependent on my parents.
I said I couldn't pretend I wasn't with Alex, we wanted to get married, and to be a part of my life, they had to accept it.
I don't think he had one "aha" moment, but maybe it just took years of rolling it over in his head and realizing that his preconceived notions of what would happen to me if I dated Alex were wrong.
Alex is my family, my other half, the love of my life.
Alex visits my parents often, and my dad sometimes calls him just to chat.
As we get ready to start our own family, I think about how I will explain this all to my future child (or children -- that's still up for discussion) about what we went through to be together.
