Paula Broadwell, a woman who was romantically involved with former CIA Director David Petraeus, will not face federal charges of cyberstalking another woman friendly with Petraeus.
Sources close to Kelley said she had not been romantically involved with Petraeus.
Broadwell, 40, wrote a biography of Petraeus, a retired general who led U.S. forces in Iraq and later in Afghanistan.
