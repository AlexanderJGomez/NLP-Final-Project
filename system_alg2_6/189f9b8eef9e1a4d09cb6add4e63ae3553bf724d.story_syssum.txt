(CNN) -- In the cold, predawn hours of February 20, 2007, shortly after 4 a.m., armed men stormed into the home I owned with my family and burst into my bedroom, shouting at me to show my hands.
That's when I realized the men were U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.
The agents arrested people even if they hadn't been a target.
During those raids in 2006 and 2007, thousands of terrified people, mostly Latino, were pulled out of bed.
In the home of three of the other people in our case, ICE knew it had already deported the person it were seeking.
I knew that the government is not supposed to enter your home without a warrant or handcuff you only because you are Latino.
