Hollande allies claimed 314 seats in the 577-member National Assembly -- the lower house of the French parliament -- according to early confirmed results by the French Interior Ministry.
Hollande has already introduced some of his programs, which are centered on growth and spending, not austerity, reversing Sarkozy's policies.
Hollande became France's first Socialist president since FranÃ§ois Mitterrand left office in 1995 as he swept to election victory over the incumbent Sarkozy, one of the most U.S.-friendly French presidents in decades.
Last month, Hollande said he wanted to balance the need to reduce the debts of European governments with efforts to stimulate growth.
