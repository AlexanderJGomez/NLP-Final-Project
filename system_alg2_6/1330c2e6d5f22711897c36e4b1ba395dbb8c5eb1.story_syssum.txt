(CNN) -- Spirit Airlines said Thursday it's sorry that hundreds of passengers had flights delayed for hours from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport because of the airline's voluntary engine inspections.
This week's inspections followed last week's engine failure on a Spirit Airlines flight shortly after takeoff from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.
Denver-bound Flight 355 was scheduled to depart Wednesday night at 8:56 p.m., but didn't leave until more than 10 hours later, on Thursday morning at 7:29 a.m.
The safety checks take about 45 minutes per aircraft, and were expected to be completed Thursday morning, she wrote.
... As always, the safety of our customers is our number one priority."
