(CNN) -- North Korea has confirmed to Swedish diplomats that it is holding an American citizen, the U.S. State Department said Friday.
According to the family, Newman and a traveling companion, Bill Hamrdla, had been on a 10-day organized private tour of North Korea.
The day before Newman was to leave North Korea, he and his tour guide met with "one or two Korean authorities," his son said.
"The tour arrangements were handled by the Korea International Travel Company," Thompson said.
Newman is one of two American citizens being held in North Korea.
It is also possible North Korean authorities mistook him for another Merrill Newman, a Korean War veteran awarded the Silver Star for valor in combat.
Of his service during the war, he only said: "I went there, did what I was told and went home, went to college and started a family.
Bill Richardson, a former ambassador to the United Nations, has visited North Korea a number of times over the years, most recently this year to discuss the release of Bae.
