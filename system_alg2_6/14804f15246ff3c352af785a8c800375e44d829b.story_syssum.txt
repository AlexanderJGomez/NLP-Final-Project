PARIS, France (CNN) -- Debris from Air France 447, which crashed en route from Brazil to France last month, killing 228 people, has arrived in France, the French air accident investigation agency BEA said Wednesday.
The search for the data and voice recorders from the plane entered a second phase last week, according to France's accident investigation agency.
"We want to stress that for the sake of the families, we hope that the search for the black boxes will be successful," an Air France representative told CNN.
Brazil called off the search for bodies on June 27, having found 51 of the 228 people who died, according to the military.
