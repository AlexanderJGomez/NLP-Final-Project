Their AdTrap device intercepts online advertisements before they reach any devices that access your Internet connection, allowing you to surf the Web -- even stream videos -- without those annoying ads.
So, Russell and Butkus set out to recreate the past and they came up with AdTrap.
Compared to the various software ad-blockers, Russell said a hardware solution is more effective because it works on every device connected to your network.
But these ads also allow websites, including CNN.com, to offer content without charge, and ad-blocking devices like AdTrap could put that business model at risk.
"We're not trying to be against all advertisers," said Julie Russell, Chad Russell's mother, who handles finances for AdTrap.
