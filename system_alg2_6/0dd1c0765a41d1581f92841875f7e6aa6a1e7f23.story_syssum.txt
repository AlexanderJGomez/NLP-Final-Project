I thought about him yesterday as I read about Jason Collins coming out as the first openly gay player in NBA history.
Can he play?
"Is this really still news?"
It shouldn't be.
But it is.
Yes, he can play.
Our sexuality is just one of a thousand pieces of our identity, not the sole determining factor.
Jason Collins is gay.
First, it was the military, now it's pro sports being forced to realize that there is no "us" and "them" when it comes to sexuality.
We're all at our best when we don't have to hide who we are, when we can bring it all to the court.
