Like many of us living in the digital age, I learned that the pop diva passed away by way of text message.
Despite her battles with drugs and alcohol, many people have good memories of her and her songs.
Houston was famous for having a very wide range.
Houston seemingly had no natural break between the high and low registers of her instrument.
This allowed many of us to sing along with her at full voice, by ourselves, in the car.
Certainly, this infectious package of beauty and talent was at least one of the reasons my youngest daughter, now a budding operatic coloratura soprano, is pursuing a life of long, beautiful gowns and very, very high notes.
Remember how she performed that voice; how she allowed us to witness it, how she obviously enjoyed it herself.
