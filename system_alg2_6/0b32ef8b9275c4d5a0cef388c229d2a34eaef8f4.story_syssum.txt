He's had more than 90 radiation treatments and 200 chemo treatments since being diagnosed with head and neck cancer eight years ago.
Now, Cossman, 61, is sitting in a doctor's office, ready to undergo a CT scan that will determine if his cancer is being kept in check.
...
Cossman is one of 16 patients with progressive forms of cancer currently taking part in a study of a developmental drug by the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Cerulean Pharma.
He wants to make others "aware of head and neck cancer, and that clinical trials are available," he says.
"You want to see how long you can actually hold the disease at bay," Fetzer says.
When the test drug is for cancer, the patients have very aggressive forms.
He underwent 36 radiation and chemo treatments over 2Â½ months.
"By June 2006," he says, "I went through every type of chemo that's been approved for head and neck cancer.
To remain in a trial, tumor growth has to be limited to 20 percent.
In his second study, he developed a tumor on his right arm.
No," he says.
So Cossman entered his fourth study this summer, the trial by Cerulean Pharma.
He says far too few cancer patients who could be eligible for trials are aware of them.
On the other end of the line, his doctor delivers the best news he's had in more than a year.
Cossman hopes to enter a new one soon.
"Definitely," he says.
