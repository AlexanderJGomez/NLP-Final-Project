Sydney has been at the forefront of this since establishing the "Sustainable Sydney 2030" vision.
The City of Sydney (CoS) has set some ambitious targets by aiming to cut 70 percent of our carbon emissions by 2030 (on 2006 levels of 5.4 million tonnes per annum).
While Sydney is moving towards a more sustainable future, climate change demands we do more.
As far as transport goes, cities like New York and London have experienced a cycling boom and despite the nay-sayers, Sydney has also seen a 113 percent increase in cycling since 2010.
