Pam Biggers disappeared while on a business trip to the Florida Panhandle in January 2008.
"It's completely baffling," said her husband, Don Biggers.
"We think she may have initially wandered off on her own," Don Biggers said.
Police searched for Biggers for weeks.
Police and the Biggers family are asking the public for help.
Biggers was last seen wearing a white sweater, black pants with white pinstripes, a wedding band and an aquamarine ring.
