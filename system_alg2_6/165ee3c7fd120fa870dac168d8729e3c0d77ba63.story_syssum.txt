Rose Mayr and Elizabeth Nass, both 19, were apparently sitting on a bridge ledge in Ellicott City, Maryland, just after midnight with their backs to the train when it derailed, according to a written statement from Howard County police.
He said he grew concerned when he heard about the accident and saw the pictures on Twitter that indicated Mayr and Nass were on the bridge.
A spokesman said Nass was an honors student in the interdisciplinary liberal studies program.
He said the train -- with two locomotives and 80 cars  -- was going 25 mph when it jumped the tracks.
"It's probably just as well to stay away, not just to be off the tracks, but stay away from the train so you know you're going to be safe," she added.
