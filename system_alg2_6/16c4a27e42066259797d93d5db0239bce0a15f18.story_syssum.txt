A disgruntled Abrahamian drops his bronze medal before leaving the arena during the presentation ceremony.
The IOC said Abrahamian violated two rules of the Olympic charter, one that bans any sort of demonstrations and another that demands respect for all Olympic athletes.
A weightlifter at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics was stripped of his bronze medal after rejecting it during the medal ceremony.
He then put it down and walked off.
