His new film, which goes into wide release Friday, tells the tale of the three Bielski brothers, who led a Jewish resistance group after escaping into the woods of Belarus in Eastern Europe.
Craig said the characters' religion had nothing to do with his interest; both roles were just fascinating parts that attracted him.
"It was in these guys' DNA," said Schreiber, who plays Zus Bielski.
"But when I read the script I felt kind of embarrassed that I didn't know about the Bielski brothers and about the Jewish resistance across the board," he said.
"You know, that's what's beautiful about their story," he said.
I think that speaks to all of us: what we are able to find within us that is fine, even magnificent within ourselves when called upon."
