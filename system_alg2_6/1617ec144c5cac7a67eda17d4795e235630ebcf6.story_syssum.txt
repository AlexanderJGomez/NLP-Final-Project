(CNN) -- Los Angeles Clippers co-owner Shelly Sterling is "moving quickly" to sell the embattled NBA franchise, with a source familiar with the situation saying she and her representatives would like to make a deal this week.
A source close to the situation said roughly two weeks ago that Donald Sterling -- who repeatedly denied he's a racist in a CNN interview -- wouldn't pay the fine, would reject the ban and might sue the NBA.
The document also says Sterling was active in the African-American community and that there was only one court case -- which he won -- of discrimination brought against him as owner of the Clippers in more than 30 years.
CNN's source on the potential sale said it was a busy Memorial Day weekend for Shelly Sterling.
Johnson called the whole situation sad in his own interview with CNN, in which he urged Sterling to sell the team.
The same source said Shelly Sterling will accept offers this week for the Clippers.
