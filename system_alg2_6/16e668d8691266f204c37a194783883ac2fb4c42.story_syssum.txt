The trafficking ring was based in -- and directed from -- China, but its two suspected leaders in Europe were arrested in the operation, in Barcelona, Spanish national police said in a statement.
The suspects include those who allegedly formed part of the smuggling ring and also those who paid for the forged documents, the spokesman said.
Once a delivery of smuggled Chinese citizens had been completed, the travel enforcers would return to their bases in China and Malaysia to await further instructions, and to avoid detection by Western police forces, police said.
The victims are often promised a better life, but then subjected to harsh forced labor conditions in clandestine factories or forced them into prostitution.
