Do you: A) Change the name of your business?
The most common reaction from business owners is option "A," dropping the ISIS reference.
In Queens, New York, the owner of the "ISIS Hookah CafÃ©" told the Daily News that he wants to change his name but can't afford the costs -- a new sign, documents and all.
Who actually looks at the name of a business with the word ISIS in it and thinks: "Wow, that terrorist group from the Middle East now opened up a cafe in the neighborhood!"
Or the 1970s children's TV show the "Shazam!-Isis Hour."
(My apologies to any "ISIL CafÃ©" owners out there.)
Why allow a terrorist group to tell you what you can call your business?
