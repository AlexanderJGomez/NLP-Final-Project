President Bush said Tuesday that he soon will start bringing some U.S. troops home from Iraq.
Bush said he is making the Iraqi troop withdrawal decision based on a recommendation from top military officers, including Gen. David Petraeus, the highest-ranking U.S. military officer in Iraq.
"Over the next several months, we will bring home about 3,400 combat support forces -- including aviation personnel, explosive ordnance teams, combat and construction engineers, military police and logistical support forces," he said.
At present, there are about 146,000 U.S. troops in Iraq.
"The effort in Afghanistan must move to the forefront and once again become our top priority," he said.
The president said Iraq and the United States will work "toward the conclusion of a strategic framework agreement and a status of forces agreement," pacts that will spell out the terms of their relationship.
He said that a Marine battalion of around 1,000 will deploy to Afghanistan in November instead of Iraq and that an Army combat brigade of around 3,500 will go in January.
Its democratic institutions are fragile.
