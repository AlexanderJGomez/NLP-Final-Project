(CNN) -- Mexico's military has notched an important success for President Felipe Calderon with the arrest of Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sanchez, the reputed boss of the powerful Gulf drug cartel.
Costilla has been indicted in the United States, accused of drug trafficking and threatening U.S. law enforcement officials in November 1999.
While not as powerful as it once was, the Gulf Cartel is one of Mexico's major drug trafficking organizations.
As Costilla rose in the cartel hierarchy, the group controlled smuggling routes in northeastern Mexico by using its enforcement arm, known as Los Zetas, authorities have said.
But Grayson said internal divisions within the Zetas will prevent them from turning the heat up on the Gulf cartel, and that the Sinaloa cartel will be the trafficking group most likely to strengthen its position.
But the arrest of Costilla was a "Mexican operation," said the U.S. drug agency's spokesman, Rusty Payne.
