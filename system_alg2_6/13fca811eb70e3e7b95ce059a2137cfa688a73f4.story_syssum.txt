The government has erected three massive pillars and completed a $1.2 billion, five-story bridge nearby where pilgrims can toss stones.
But Mohammadi said, "There are 10 vans on the second floor especially designated to serve the elderly and handicapped.
As a measure to alleviate harm, according to Muslim traditions, the elderly and the handicapped can appoint someone else to stone for them.
The stoning ritual is done over at least two days, where pilgrims stone three pillars at Mina -- believed to be where the Prophet Abraham stoned the devil when he tried to dissuade him from obeying God's orders to slaughter his son.
It's where pilgrims go around the black cube seven times counter-clockwise asking that their Lord accept their pilgrimage and grant them another visit to the holy city.
