(CNN) -- Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris was rebounding Saturday after hundreds of flights were canceled because of a shortage of de-icing fluid during snow and ice that snarled air traffic across Europe, authorities said.
It is an isolated case in Europe," said Gourgeoan.
About a foot of snow had fallen on the roof Friday by the time authorities decided to close the terminal, French media reports said.
Charles de Gaulle is the second busiest airport in Europe, after Heathrow in London.
