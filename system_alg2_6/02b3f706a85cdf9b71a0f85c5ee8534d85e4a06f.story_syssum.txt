Rome (CNN) -- Mario Monti, the economist nominated to become Italy's new prime minister, began talks with political leaders Monday to discuss forming a government.
Italian party leaders spoke in support of the new prime minister designate on Italy's senate TV after exiting deliberations with Monti on the composition of a new government.
His party will not block a Monti-led government, he said.
"For the time being he is waiting to see what is happening under the buildup of the new government under Mr. Monti," said Deborah Bergamini, a member of Italy's Parliament and former assistant to Berlusconi.
In announcing Monti's nomination, Italian President Giorgio Napolitano said the former European Union commissioner is "gifted, competent, experienced" and well-respected in Europe and internationally.
The upper and lower houses of parliament have 10 days from the time Monti is sworn in to hold separate votes of confidence on the new government.
So my feeling is that the challenge today will be rebalancing ... politics and financial matters," Bergamini told CNN Monday.
