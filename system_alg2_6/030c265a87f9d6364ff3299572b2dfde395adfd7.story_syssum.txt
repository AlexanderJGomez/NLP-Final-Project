Displayed are 112,225 gifts for Kim Il Sung, his son Kim Jong Il and current leader Kim Jong Un from 184 different countries.
Former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright gave Kim Jong Il a silver dish when she visited in October 2000.
Of course, these gifts look rather paltry when I entered the next room and saw an actual train -- a gift from the communist leader of the USSR in 1945.
Not to be outdone, in 1953, Chairman Mao Zedong of China also gave the North Korean leader a train.
