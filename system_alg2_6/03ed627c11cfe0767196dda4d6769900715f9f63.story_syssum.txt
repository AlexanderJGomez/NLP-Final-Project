(CNN) -- Years before Jerry Sandusky was charged with child sexual abuse, a psychologist told Penn State police in 1998 that the former assistant football coach acted the way a pedophile might.
In addition to Chambers' evaluation, NBC News released a 1998 campus police report tied to the same sexual misconduct allegations against Sandusky.
Penn State rejected a CNN public records request for a copy of the 1998 police report in December.
"I wish I could get forgiveness.
Why were reports of inappropriate contact between Sandusky and young boys on the Penn State campus and Penn state activities consistently ignored?"
CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.
