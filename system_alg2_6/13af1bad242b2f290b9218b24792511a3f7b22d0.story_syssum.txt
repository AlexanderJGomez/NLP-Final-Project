In late December, the three-judge panel found Katsav guilty of two charges of rape, two charges of forceful sexual harassment and one charge of sexual harassment.
The judges who read the verdict said that "due to the severity of the crime, the punishment must be clear and precise."
His lawyers said he will appeal the sentence.
