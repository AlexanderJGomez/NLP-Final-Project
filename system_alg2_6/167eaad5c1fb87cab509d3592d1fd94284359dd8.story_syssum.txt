And then the nightmare ends with the suspect, later identified as Michael Brandon Hill, taken into custody and no one inside or outside the Decatur school even hurt, despite the gunfire.
"He doesn't want the kids, he wants the police, so back off," she said in the call.
By the end -- with police themselves having never directly talked to him -- Tuff and the gunman were talking about where he would put his weapon, how he'd empty his pockets and where he'd lie down before authorities could get him.
He could, too.
That day, for everyone at that school, everything did turn out OK.
"You did a great job," McCray said, shortly after the two met in person for the first time Thursday for an exclusive interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper.
"Her name, Antoinette Tuff, says everything about her," said Brian Bolden, the school principal.
Counseling was made available to the kids, and the school understands that some children might not be ready to come back right away, he said.
Whenever the charges come down, Hill will waive his initial court appearance, said Claudia Saari, public defender for the Stone Mountain Judicial Circuit.
He has a criminal history in DeKalb and neighboring Henry County that, while not "lengthy," does include violence, Davis said.
Being from DeKalb County, Hill "possibly had been there (at the school) before speaking with some people in the administration," Davis said.
"He entered a school, an elementary school with children in it ... to do one of two things: Either to do harm to those children and/or any first responders."
Community members and leaders are offering praise for Tuff and police, as well as gratitude that the story did not turn tragic.
