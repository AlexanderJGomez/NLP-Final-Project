LONDON, England (CNN) -- Harry Patch -- the last surviving British soldier from World War I -- died Saturday at the age of 111, Britain's Ministry of Defence said.
After the war, Harry returned to his work as a plumber and later became a sanitary engineer.
His wife, Ada, died in 1976, and their two sons also later died.
Patch didn't speak about the war until he turned 100, the Ministry of Defence said.
"In speaking about his experiences, Harry began at last to come to terms with his war, and was at peace with himself and his memories," the Defence Ministry said.
Last year, King Albert II of Belgium made Patch a Knight of the Order of Leopold.
Dannatt said.
