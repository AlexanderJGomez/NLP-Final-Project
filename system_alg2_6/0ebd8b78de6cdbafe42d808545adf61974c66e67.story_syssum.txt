Ronaldo, Messi, Messi, Messi, Messi, Ronaldo, Ronaldo.

The two couldn't be much more different, in style and, if you are to believe the majority of the media, likability.
Ronaldo has suffered the slings and arrows of a largely hostile press for much of his career, starting as a foal-limbed teen in Manchester, where he was often derided as a "show pony," for elaborate and unnecessary tricks, and -- a sin in the English game -- diving to win free kicks and penalties.
But the stats don't lie, and with the phenomenal return of 61 goals from 60 appearances (42 in 30 La Liga games alone) during 2014, it's hard not to give credit to this year's winner.
He's also developed in leaps and bounds since his 2008 World Player of the Year trophy, refined his unquestionable talent since he first grinned on that FIFA stage.
And, like the man or not, no one should begrudge him his time at the pinnacle.
