Do you think that Lars von Trier is a woman-hater?
"I think that if you are, shall we say, sensitive, then there is a good side and a bad side about it," said von Trier.
Von Trier claimed each morning she would say "Mr von Trier, I despise you," and spit at him.
"I was scared," admitted Gainsbourg who won Best Actress at Cannes for her performance.
But, von Trier says, he has always taken a deeply personal approach to the experimental, often dark and challenging works that he creates.
