(CNN) -- My participation in the British Invasion came as a total surprise to me.
Suddenly, I was juggling two careers and a family.
The spearhead of the "Invasion" was of course the Beatles.
There was "I Know a Place," "Don't Sleep in the Subway," "Colour My World," "Days" and more.
I seemed to be constantly bouncing around between the United States and Europe and was jet-lagged most of the time!
The British Invasion came and went, but left behind a body of music that lives on today.
