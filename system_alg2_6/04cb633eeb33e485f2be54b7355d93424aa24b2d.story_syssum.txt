Marcus Schrenker, 38, of McCordsville, Indiana, pleaded guilty in June to charges of destruction of an aircraft and causing the Coast Guard to respond when no help is needed.
On January 11, Schrenker took off alone from Anderson, Indiana, in a Piper PA46 plane, saying he was headed for Destin, Florida.
The Coast Guard dispatched rescue helicopters from New Orleans, Louisiana, and Mobile, Alabama, in case the plane crashed on land and sent two cutters in case it crashed into the Gulf of Mexico, prosecutors have said.
In a search of the plane, authorities found handwritten notes on the inside back cover of a campground book, saying among other things, "windshield is spider cracking," "doors open," "bleeding very bad" and "graying out," the documents said.
When questioned by federal officials, Schrenker claimed that his windshield struck him in the face and his door malfunctioned, the court documents said.
Indiana officials agreed to allow the federal case against Schrenker to proceed before seeking to extradite him, prosecutors have said.
