"I can't tell you how many wonderful Syrians I have met here who've devoted their money and time to see a democratic, free Syria," said Mohammed, whose last name is being withheld by CNN to protect his brother and parents in Syria.
For Mohammad and many other Syrian expatriates, there is no going back to the old Syria.
When one of the students asked how he reacts to the latest videos coming out of Syria, Hallak said he doesn't watch anymore.
In Detroit, Mohammad said he was going to anti-al-Assad rallies even before the Syrian secret police, the Mukhabarhat, arrested his brother who was protesting in Syria.
Mohammad said he would not tell his brother to stop protesting.
