(CNN) -- For sale: One football club, formerly the best in Europe, now fallen on hard times.
"You have on one hand the likes of Sheikh Mansour who bought Manchester City, put his money where his mouth is and within four years has transformed the club from also-rans into title winners.
Remember, Manchester City wasn't the first club Sheikh Mansour bankrolled.
Forest's near neighbor Leicester City, another club to have lost top-flight status in recent years, is now owned by a Thai group -- but Chadwick says there is a big difference in their earning potential.
We drool at clubs like Barcelona, Manchester United and Inter Milan winning the Champions League, but Forest won back-to-back European Cups just over 30 years ago and had one of the most iconic managers -- Brian Clough -- in charge.
Doughty brought in former England manager Steve McClaren at the start of last season with disastrous results, and the current FC Twente coach's short reign resulted in the Forest benefactor -- considered one of the most powerful men in UK business -- standing down as chairman.
"They will have to manage the club in a very shrewd way to make sure they don't get back into debt in the same way.
If Forest fans are getting overexcited about their future, they don't have to look very far for proof that such a takeover can go horribly wrong.
No matter your intentions or how much money you've got, experience of the industry is very important," Chadwick said.
If they are looking to win the Premier League and get in the Champions League, they are going to have to invest a significant amount of money.
