Featuring passenger comforts such as bigger windows, larger overhead bins and better ventilation, United's Dreamliner is set for its first flight at 7:25 a.m. November 4 from Houston to Chicago O'Hare International Airport.
It's efficient and performs well, and it's also a very good-looking aircraft.
United says its Dreamliners will include 36 first-class seats, 72 premium-economy seats and 111 economy seats.
