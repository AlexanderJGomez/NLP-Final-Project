The Wallflowers broke through in 1996 with the quadruple-platinum album "Bringing Down the Horse" before going on hiatus in 2007.
Reuniting gave them a new sense of direction, "like a reset button," Dylan said.

"I mean, the lyrics are planned in advance, but they're not about me, and you won't know the meaning unless I tell you.
To demonstrate, Dylan took a song from the new album at random -- "Constellation Blues" -- and came up with a viable interpretation of it on the spot, giving it a cosmic yet nonsensical meaning probably unintended when he wrote it.
It's not like three-minute pop songs fall out of the sky, but I think if you have to explain the song, it's not a good song.
Dylan said.
