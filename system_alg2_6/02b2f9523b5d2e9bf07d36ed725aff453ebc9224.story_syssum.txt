In "a recommendation for dismissal" filed in court Monday, two prosecutors in the Manhattan district attorney's office laid out their arguments for requesting that numerous charges -- including attempted rape and sexual assault -- be dismissed, citing fresh evidence and questions about the accuser's credibility.
There was "no trauma to her body or oral cavity" and "scrapings from underneath her fingernails ... yielded no results."
Thompson had said before the meeting Monday that he believed Vance was going to drop the charges.
Diallo, who has conducted high-profile interviews about the case, and her attorneys have said Strauss-Kahn attacked her, and that her case should go to trial.
Attorneys for Diallo complain she is being treated by prosecutors like a criminal defendant and not an alleged victim.
"This is not a 'he said, she said' case," Thompson said Sunday.
"If you go back to the hearing on May 16, when (an assistant district attorney) called the evidence against Strauss-Kahn 'substantial' and he said the medical exam (of Diallo) supports her account, this is not a 'he said, she said' case.
"This is a case that looks like it has nothing but losers -- the alleged victim, the defendant, and the prosecutor," Toobin said.
