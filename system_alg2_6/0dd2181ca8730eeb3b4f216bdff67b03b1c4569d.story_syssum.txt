(CNN) -- When the Burj Khalifa officially opened in Dubai on Monday, much of the world press noted the irony of the world's tallest building unveiled just weeks after the emirate's debt crash.
All of these New York buildings were conceived before the 1929 Crash, and opened after the Great Depression had begun.
But Thornton argues in his 2005 research paper, "Skyscrapers and Business Cycles," that the correlation is real: Skyscrapers are a physical manifestation of the bull markets that build them.
The components that give rise to the skyscrapers give rise to the boom: loose monetary policy and easy credit drive up land prices, "and people want to build higher to offset that," he said.
The past decade since the completion of the Petronas Towers "has been a period of time for unprecedented success of tall buildings," he said, but with the ribbon-cutting of the Burj Khalifa and the economic downturn, he believes the go-go times in the high-rise race are over -- for now.
"My personal view is it will be a while before you'll see any other building built that beats the Burj," he said.
