Prosecutor Gerrie Nel has accused the athlete of hiding the truth about the death of Steenkamp, whom he shot last year through a closed toilet door in his home in Pretoria, South Africa.
Pistorius said he thought he heard the toilet door opening before he fired.
Pistorius earlier denied being "ready to shoot" as he made his way to the bathroom where he says he heard what he thought was an intruder.
Asked by the prosecutor why he approached the apparent threat rather than seeking to move out of harm's way, the athlete said it was his in his nature to respond that way.
Nel also argued that it was "not possible" that Steenkamp would not have responded when Pistorius screamed to her about what he thought was an intruder in the house, as he has said happened.
Pistorius said he did not.
Pistorius replied that he didn't because he was sure about what he had heard.
Pistorius became emotional as the cross-examination continued, prompting Nel to ask him why.
Nel has previously accused Pistorius of becoming emotional when the questions get difficult.

Nel also sought to paint him as selfish and demanded to know why the athlete did not respond to his girlfriend's declaration of love.
"Because it was all about Mr. Pistorius," Nel said.
His testimony can be heard on an audio feed.
