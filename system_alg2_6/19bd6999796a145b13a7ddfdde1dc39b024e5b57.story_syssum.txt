"They are the 1% of America who kept the 99% safe," Bush said Wednesday of the 2.5 million military members who have served since 9/11.
"It's an unprecedented demand that we've placed on such a small group," said Paul Rieckhoff, head of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA).
The Bush Institute is working with a coalition of government, nonprofit, universities and private companies to de-stigmatize PTSD, help GI Bill recipients stay in school, and encourage employers to give veterans a chance.
"Employers would not hesitate to hire an employee getting treated for a medical condition like diabetes or high blood pressure and they should not hesitate to hire veterans getting treated for post-traumatic stress," he said.
A report released last March calculated that the cost of the wars, including health care for veterans, would be up to $6 trillion dollars.
The United States has spent around $2 trillion directly on the military operations there.
