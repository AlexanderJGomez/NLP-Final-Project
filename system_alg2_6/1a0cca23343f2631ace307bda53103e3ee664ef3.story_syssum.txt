Kathleen Sebelius dives into discussing the swine flu at the White House after being sworn in.
Until her confirmation, the White House, which declared a public health emergency Sunday, was dealing with its first crisis without a secretary.
Tiller and his staff attended a 2007 reception Sebelius held at the governor's mansion in Topeka.
Sebelius, 60, is the daughter of former Ohio Gov.
Former Senate GOP leader Bob Dole, also from Kansas, testified on Sebelius' behalf in March, arguing that her record had proven her ability to work in a bipartisan manner.
Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and Jon Huntsman of Utah commended her selection.
