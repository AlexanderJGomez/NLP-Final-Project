The horrors in Rotherham first came to light in 2010, when five men were jailed for sexual offenses against underage girls.
A journalist's investigation into the wider scale of abuse prompted the local council to conduct its own report -- and it's the staggering numbers revealed in Jay's findings that have caught the public's attention.
But a focus on political correctness should not distract from the wider, institutional betrayal of children by police, social services and local politicians.
These crimes were often reported.
When crimes were reported, cases were gathered and reports filed to the council's staff and elected officials.
There is also the frightening possibility that those responsible for failing to defend the children will not see justice.
The report does not name names and it's likely that the social workers and council staff who were so obviously negligent have moved on to jobs in other areas, spreading their incompetence across the country.
Professor Jay did indicate that services have improved at the council but added that it remains understaffed and the long-term victim support inadequate.
That is the only effective way to expose those responsible, and to shed light on the Dickensian nightmare playing out in modern Britain.
