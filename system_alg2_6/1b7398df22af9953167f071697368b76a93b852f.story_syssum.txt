Atlanta (CNN) -- Top officials from the Federal Aviation Administration and the air traffic controllers' union kicked off a cross-country tour of air traffic control facilities on Monday, two days after a seventh reported case this year of a controller falling asleep on the job.
"We will do better."
If the shift from eight to nine hours isn't enough, "then obviously we'll take that into consideration," LaHood said.
On Saturday, the FAA suspended an air traffic controller for sleeping on the job at the Miami Air Route Traffic Control Center.
All of the incidents occurred during controllers' midnight shifts.
