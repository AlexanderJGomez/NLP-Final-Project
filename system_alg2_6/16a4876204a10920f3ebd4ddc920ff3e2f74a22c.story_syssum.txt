Last week, a 25-year follow-up of the Canadian National Breast Screening Study was published -- one of the eight major randomized trials of screening mammography.
The allegation of cheating -- purposely putting women whom researchers knew had advanced cancers in the mammography group -- is an incredibly serious one.
The new study provides evidence that randomization did exactly what it is supposed to do: It created two identical groups of women.
Why?
It found small breast cancers.
In the Canadian trial, one group received a regular physical exam of the breast -- a very careful exam performed by specially trained nurses.
Further, the Canadian trial confirms that the harm of being overdiagnosed by screening mammography is real: One in five invasive cancers found by screening represents overdiagnosis.
Overdiagnosed women are told they have cancer, are treated for cancer, yet their "cancer" is not destined to cause them any problems.
It's time to get the science back in screening mammography and to recognize that mammographers may not be the ideal source for balanced information.
