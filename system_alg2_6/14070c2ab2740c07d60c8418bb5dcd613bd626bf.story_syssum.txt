The Gahanna-Jefferson School District began teaching Mandarin Chinese four years ago and since then, the number of students in the program has increased from about 40 to 350.
The funds will be used, school officials say, to support their visiting teacher from China and to foster the newly formed relationship with their sister school in the southern Chinese province of Kunming.
"We feel very lucky that we have this," Aldis said.
Aldis added that having guest teachers from China who are native speakers adds to the experience.
I think China has a beautiful culture."
Outside Los Angeles, the Hacienda La Puente Unified School District was set to receive similar funds from the Chinese government through the Confucius Classroom network.
School officials at Ohio's Gahanna-Jefferson school district maintain that is not part of their curriculum.
Parent Mandy Aldis said she isn't bothered one bit by the program being funded by China's government.
