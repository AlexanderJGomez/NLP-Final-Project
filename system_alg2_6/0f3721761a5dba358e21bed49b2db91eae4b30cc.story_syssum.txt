The woman identified as Kelli Fuller said her drunk husband was assaulting her.
About a minute into the call, as dispatchers summon help, Kelli Fuller is heard saying "I hate you, I hate you."

"This incident has been very embarrassing to me, my family, friends and the court," he said in his statement, "I deeply regret this incident and look forward to working to resolve these difficulties with my family, where they should be resolved."
In cases of domestic violence, the question is often raised whether the victim will "press charges."
Whether the Rices and Fullers stay married is their business; but whether Ray Rice and Judge Mark Fuller committed crimes should be a question for prosecutors, and ultimately, juries to decide.
