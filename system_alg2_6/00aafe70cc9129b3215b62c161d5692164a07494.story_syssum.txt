There are still seats to be filled at McLaren, Force India and Toro Rosso.
The Spaniard -- a double world champion with Renault in 2005 and 2006 -- is regarded as the key to the F1 driver market.
Alonso is expected to lead this new era at McLaren, although the fiercely ambitious driver may first want guarantees that the Honda engine is going to be a success.
Vettel will partner Kimi Raikkonen -- the last man to win a world title with Ferrari in 2007 -- in 2015 but there are no guarantees the car and its Ferrari engine will be any match for the might of Mercedes.
Button -- the 2009 world champion with Brawn Grand Prix which has since morphed into Mercedes -- has remained sanguine about his future and has even explored the idea of moving to sports car racing.
There's also only one seat up for grabs at Toro Rosso, who will blood 17-year-old Max Verstappen as the youngest F1 driver in history next season.
Sauber announced Swede Marcus Ericsson and Brazilian Felipe Nasr as its 2015 drivers in November much to the chagrin of current driver Adrian Sutil, who believed he had a contract with the team for next season.
Both Caterham and Marussia remain on the official entry list for the 2015 season but their future is dependent on a hard winter drumming up funding to stay in the sport.
