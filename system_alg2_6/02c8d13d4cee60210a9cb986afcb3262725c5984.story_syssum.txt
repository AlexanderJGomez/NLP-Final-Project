But as neural devices become more complicated, and go wireless, some scientists say the risks of "brain hacking" should be taken seriously.
But as neural engineering becomes more complex and more widespread, the potential for security breaches will mushroom.
"It's evidence that people will be malicious and try to compromise peoples' health using computers, especially if neural devices become more widespread."
Despite the risks, Kohno said, most new devices aren't created with security in mind.
It's never too early to start thinking about security issues, said neural engineer Justin Williams of the University of Wisconsin, who was not involved in the research.
"These kinds of security issues have to proceed in lockstep with the technology," Williams said.
Kohno said.
