Anti-government demonstrators in Riffa had planned a march.
Bahrain's ambassador to the United States took the unusual step of commenting on the clashes in Riffa, which he called a "sectarian conflict" between Shia and Sunni Muslim factions.
The attempted march in Riffa was organized by some of the more hard-line Shia groups among the government opposition.
More than 500 people have been injured in Bahrain since the protest began, which human rights activists say is part of a wave of popular unrest crashing through the Arab world
