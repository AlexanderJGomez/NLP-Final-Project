(CNN) -- On Friday, Pope Francis announced the canonization of two of his predecessors: Pope John Paul II (pope from 1978 to 2005) and Pope John XXIII (1958-1963).
Why does a pope become a saint?
Over the first 1,500 years of Catholic history, people generally became saints through popular acclamation rather than through a formal papal process.
Pope John Paul II, in fact, oversaw the canonization of more people (483) than had been canonized in the previous 500 years, in part to lend the weight of Vatican authority to saints that had emerged throughout the global Catholic world.
John Paul II's sainthood has been promoted by many of the more conservative elements within the Catholic world.
