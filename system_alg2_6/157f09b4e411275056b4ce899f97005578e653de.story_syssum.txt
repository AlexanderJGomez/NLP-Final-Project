Now, the prominent Ohio conservative will be known for something else: reversing his hardline position against gay marriage.
"I'm announcing today a change of heart on an issue that a lot of people feel strongly about that has to do with gay couples' opportunity to marry," Portman told CNN.
He told CNN that he never suspected that his son was gay.
"I told Mitt Romney everything," said Portman with a laugh.
"Well, because they told me," said Portman.
You know, I followed my heart," he said.
Look, and to be honest with you, it didn't affect that decision-making much, because it was, I didn't think it was appropriate," Portman said.
"I thought it was the right time to let folks know where I stand so there's no confusion, so I would be clear about it," said Portman.
"Well, I would say that, you know, I've had a change of heart based on a personal experience.
"He wanted to tell us that there's something about him that we didn't know," Portman said, reflecting on the day two years ago his son Will first told his parents he was gay.
Did it change the way you think about same-sex marriage or gay men, lesbians or bisexuals in general?
