"Things like this rarely happen here," said Yadira Abigail Flores Delgado, who works at a nearby private security firm.
In a strong blow to one of Mexico's most notorious drug cartels, Mexico's navy killed Arturo Beltran Leyva, head of the Beltran Leyva cartel and one of Mexico's three most wanted criminals.
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said that its cooperation with Mexico played a role in Wednesday's action.
On Thursday, authorities presented to the media two women and a man who were arrested in the raid.
Three military personnel posted themselves inside the hospital hours before the shooting started, saying only that they were in the middle of an operation, said Dr. Antonio Villa Montiel.
Three navy personnel were wounded by hand grenades, one fatally, the navy said.
The death of the leader of a major drug cartel is a victory for the government, but it could also spur more violence, said Payan, an expert on drug trafficking in Mexico.
A series of disputes over the past years, however, led the Beltran Leyva brothers to turn on El Chapo, or "shorty," and they have been most recently linked with Los Zetas, another violent cartel opposed to the Sinaloa group.
The Beltran Leyva cartel is known for air transportation expertise, Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Michael Sanders said.
"Calderon has finally understood two things: that the army is susceptible to corruption, and that the army is not sufficient," Payan said.
