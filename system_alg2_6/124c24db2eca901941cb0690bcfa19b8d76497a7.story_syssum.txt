On Sundays, the NFL's cool efficiency can look more bloodless than its own video games, as if the real thing was now just a parlor game to bet on.
It won so often, for so long, that it could lose every game for the next 65 seasons and still have a record above .500.
During a wake a couple years ago for one longtime fan, six tickets for the next home game were spotted in the open casket.
For Reggie McQueen, a defensive back and aspiring rapper, taking the field on Friday nights allowed him to watch his parents smile, talk with a dead aunt, and play a little ball beside his murdered cousin.
Crouching in the defensive backfield before each play -- dreads spilling from his helmet, tats stamped up and down both arms -- Reggie often talked aloud to his dead cousin, gunned down a year earlier in a shootout at a public housing complex across town from the one where Reggie and his mother then lived.
Or he'd talk to a long-dead aunt who lived with Reggie and his mother, the light of young Reggie's life before she was murdered.
"I got a lot of people who aren't here on my back," Reggie told me one night.
"It's more than a game.
On the field on Friday night, I'm doing something that loves me back -- I love it and it loves me back."
"I seen people standing on that same corner all my life," Reggie said.
Like Reggie, teammate Malcolm Mitchell also learned to love the game in high school, and it loved him back, too.
That last high school season, he told me about a voice in his head when he took the field, how it told him to anticipate something before it happened, and what to do when it came about.
"I got my way into the museum -- into the history books," Malcolm said one afternoon after that season.
Malcolm just smiled.
"For an athlete who loves to play the game, it happens more than you know," he said.
