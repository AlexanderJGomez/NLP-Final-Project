Radel spoke to reporters after returning home to Fort Myers, Florida, Wednesday night.
Sometimes in life you need a wake-up call.
Radel said he hopes he can win back the trust of the many people he hurt, including his wife.
"Your honor, I apologize for what I've done," Radel told Judge Robert Tignor in court Wednesday.
Federal agents approached Radel after he left the vehicle, and Radel dropped the cocaine to the street, according to court documents.
"The defendant also retrieved and provided to the agents a vial of cocaine that he had in his apartment," the court documents say.
