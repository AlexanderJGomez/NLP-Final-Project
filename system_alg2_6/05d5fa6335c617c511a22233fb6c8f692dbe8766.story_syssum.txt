On the day the new Ebola clinic in Liberia opened, ambulances waited outside.
A little boy tried to walk out of another ambulance, but he too collapsed.
When asked why no one from the hospital was helping them get inside, a hospital worker said staff was inside suiting up in protective gear.
"I think the lesson here is that people come too late," said Peter Graaff.
Graaff said he would try to find out why hospital workers didn't come help the patients.
It's horrible."
