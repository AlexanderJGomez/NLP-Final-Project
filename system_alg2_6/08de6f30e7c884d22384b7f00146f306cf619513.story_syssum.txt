"It was not as bad as I feared it would be," Tugend said.
Irene left more than 4 million homes and businesses in the dark up and down the East Coast, and authorities blamed it for the deaths of at least 18 people in seven states.
As the storm clouds neared, New York City took the unprecedented step of ordering 370,000 people to evacuate.
After the storm moved north, however, people in places such as Ocean City, Maryland, were thankful that Irene had not left behind as much devastation as it could have.
"I think we took a lot of lessons from every one of these different disasters," Christie said.
On Sunday, though, some people asked if the danger was over-hyped.
"There was so much expectation about, and fear about, what might happen in New York City," he said.
Meteorologists measured pressure levels inside the storm that could have allowed it to strengthen back into a Category 3 hurricane, Myers said, but Irene's romp over land in North Carolina prevented the eye wall from spinning into a more destructive storm by the time it arrived in New York.
He thanked people for heeding Mayor Michael Bloomberg's order to evacuate, which authorities lifted at 3 p.m. Sunday.
