Bogota, Tennessee (CNN) -- Those who say no man is an island never met Danny Hayes.
Whatever comes, Hayes said he will not be moved.
To get to dry ground, Hayes paddles a small boat about 50 yards to Highway 78.
The homes around Hayes' trailer sit empty, but as he waits out the flood, he is hardly alone.
But his and his neighbors' homes are safe, Hayes said, while he patrols his small "island."
So stubborn he married and divorced the same woman three times before they finally called it quits.
Asked what he will do while the floodwaters retreat, Hayes replied with a ready joke.
