The British aren't coming!"
Russia's weekly newspaper the Moscow News says the debate is "a stunning defeat" for Cameron.
UK's daily newspaper The Independent said Cameron's military plans were "shot down in a dramatic Commons vote" and that "foreign policy is in disarray."
British tabloid newspaper The Mirror also claims that UK politicians cannot pin Damascus on a map.
French news outlet France 24 expresses shock at the result of the vote, claiming that the nation's President Francois Hollande will maintain his firm stance in support of military intervention.
However, unlike the uncertain grounds of that war, the paper points to the strong evidence of the use of chemical weapons.
