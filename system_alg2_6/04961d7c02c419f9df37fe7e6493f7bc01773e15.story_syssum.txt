Now the estate of Marshall is releasing some of the never-before-seen photos of the band in a new book "The Rolling Stones 1972" (Chronicle Books), out on August 15.
Davis told CNN that what made Marshall's shots unique was that he always demanded total access to the rock stars.
Marshall's ability to camouflage without disturbing the band's dynamic also allowed him to experience the touring life of the Rolling Stones, Davis said.
"It really set the precedent for the rock star concert tour," she said.
"Mick was very business-oriented," Davis said.
"Jim was always trying to show the true face of whatever he photographed," Davis said.
He said, 'I was a historian with a camera and I didn't know it.'
