The video of Hatcher in the hotel room was taken last year, "somewhere in Siberia," said the senior State Department official who watched the video.
It was shot in a hotel that Hatcher visited, the official said.
Last year, this official said, Hatcher was the lead officer compiling the State Department's Religious Freedom report and was given an award for his work by the ambassador.
The officials asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.
