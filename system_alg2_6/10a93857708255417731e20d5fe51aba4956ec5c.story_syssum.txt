Santos said he has been thinking about the possibility of peace ever since the FARC's military commander was killed in 2010.
Peace talks between the rebels -- the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC -- and the government have occurred sporadically since the 1980s.
Yet, the president has said their will be no cease-fire while the two sides are in talks, though the rebels have said they would ask for one.
"The FARC should now take this opportunity to end its decades of terrorism and narcotics trafficking, and allow the Colombian people to continue building a democratic, prosperous and just society."
