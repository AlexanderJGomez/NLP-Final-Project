Africa has not produced a grand slam singles finalist since Kevin Curren at the 1985 Wimbledon Championships, while Wayne Ferreira reached the semis of the Australian Open for the second time in 2003 and former world No.
"We would like every country in Africa to replicate the experience of Burundi," the International Tennis Federation's development projects administrator Frank Couraud told CNN.
It's not an attitude that's prevalent in Africa, where tennis ranks below sports such as football and athletics when it comes to government funding.
It's a small step, but has earned him a place in the team to tour North America ahead of September's U.S. Open along with Madagascar's Zarah Razafimahatratra -- who's in her second year with the program.
We give them the right opportunity now so one day they become professional tennis players -- and then suddenly other African kids will relate to these players.
But it's a huge step from being a good junior to a successful professional, especially in a place where travel and equipment are more expensive than the U.S. or Europe.
One of the problems of being in South Africa is we're pretty far from the tennis scene.
A lot of South African players are pretty sheltered when they go out there for the first time," Anderson said.
While Anderson believes Africa needs more high-profile singles players like Curren, Ferreira and Coetzer to grow the game, his former compatriot Huber is not so sure that it will change the status quo.
"When Wes Moodie and I won Wimbledon doubles titles in 2005, I actually thought it would change tennis in South Africa.
"We had the opportunity to get back in the World Group -- and they didn't pay my ticket," said Huber, who has since represented the U.S. at the Olympics and in Fed Cup.
"We had Amanda Coetzer in the top-10 at the time, but having a good singles player didn't raise the profile.
It's an eye-opener that it hasn't changed."
