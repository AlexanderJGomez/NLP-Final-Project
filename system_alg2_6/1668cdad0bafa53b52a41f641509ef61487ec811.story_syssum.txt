(CNN) -- Pakistan wrapped up a first series whitewash over top-ranked England on Monday by winning the third and final Test in Dubai by 71 runs, making history in the process.
England captain Andrew Strauss said the defeat should serve as a warning ahead of a two-match series with Sri Lanka, which starts at the end of March.
We've got a lot of cricket coming up.
Jonathan Trott followed as England slipped to 85-2 and Kevin Pietersen continued his poor form by also making 18 before being removed by Ajmal.
Graeme Swann (1) fell to Gul soon after and Ajmal ended a stubborn ninth-wicket partnership of 34 when he had James Anderson caught at slip for nine.
