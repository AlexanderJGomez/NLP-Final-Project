Every second, millions of people across the world are sharing their thoughts in the form of 140-character messages using Twitter.
To demonstrate the unique power of Twitter data, our research group at Northeastern University and Harvard Medical School recently began a study to infer the mood of Twitter users in the United States from their public tweets.
Never before have academic researchers had access to this much real-time public information about what people are thinking and saying.
Because most users leave their tweets public, Twitter represents an unprecedented opportunity.
This is why researchers owe a debt of gratitude to Twitter for its policy of open access to public tweets (exemplified by the recent donation of its entire public tweet history to the Library of Congress).
From a scientific standpoint, Twitter data can shed light on how information spreads through society.
