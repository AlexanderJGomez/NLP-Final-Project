Once she arrived home, Donnelly implored firefighters to get her cat, but they were busy trying to control the blaze.
Donnelly was thrilled to learn that Red Paw could provide free short-term care for Kramer.
"Letting them know, 'We'll take care of your animal like it is our own,' it means the world to people."
How is my pet going to get medical care?"
Now, whenever the Red Cross responds to a disaster and discovers that an animal is involved, they call Leary.
Rescuing animals is only part of what Red Paw does.
Red Paw, which runs on donations, provides care for most animals for around 60 days.
"I cried when we were reunited," said Donnelly.
For Leary, helping families and their pets is what her work is all about.
