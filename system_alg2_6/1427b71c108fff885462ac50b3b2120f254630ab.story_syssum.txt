LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- Police and soldiers killed at least 133 people during two days of riots between Muslims and Christians in Nigeria last year, Human Rights Watch alleged Monday.
They combed the garage hunting for people.
One of them said, 'Today you go die,' and then he shot him in the side.
Police then returned and shot tear gas into the neighbor's house, he testified.
The rights group said the state commission examining the riots should investigate and call for the prosecution of security forces involved.
Human Rights Watch estimates that more than 1,000 people were killed in riots in 2001.
