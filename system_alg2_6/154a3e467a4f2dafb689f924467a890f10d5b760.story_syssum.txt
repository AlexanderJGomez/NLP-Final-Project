Muse was arrested in the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama, a cargo ship that pirates attacked on April 8 about 350 miles off the Somali coast.
A third crew member, Crew Member 3, also heard the radio message and began shutting down the ship's power, the complaint said.
The captain then ordered the crew to the bridge after Muse ordered him to do so, the complaint said, citing Crew Member 2.
At one point, Phillips tried to escape and the pirates shot at him, the complaint said.
While Muse was away from the lifeboat, Navy SEALs shot and killed the three remaining pirates.
