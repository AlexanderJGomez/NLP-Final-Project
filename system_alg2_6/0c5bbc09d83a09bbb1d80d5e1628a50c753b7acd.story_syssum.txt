(CNN) -- Argentine coach Diego Maradona has urged Carlos Tevez to quit Manchester United at the end of the season and head for Italy.
Benzema, whose contract runs until 2013, made his mark against United in a Champions League tie last season when he scored in a first leg tie.
It follows the findings of an arbitration tribunal in favour of Sheffield United and against West Ham last year which decided Tevez should not have been able to play for the Hammers at the end of the 2006-07 season.
Premier League West Ham insist that they have nothing to hide.
