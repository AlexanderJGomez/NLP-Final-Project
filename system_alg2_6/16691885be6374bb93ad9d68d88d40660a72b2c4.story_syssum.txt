(CNN) -- Milagros Martinez endured losing one of her sons to cystic fibrosis before he could get a lung transplant.
Sarah also needs a lung transplant.
"If Javi does not receive this transplant, he will die," Martinez said.
"Like any parent, I'm inclined to do whatever it takes, to help Javier have a normal life, whatever that may be."
