(CNN)At the edge of the Syrian war, photographer Furkan Temir found despair packed in tent camps and an outpouring of humanity from a tight-knit Turkish border community.
"I could not just come during the day and sleep in a hotel at night because I wanted to feel what they feel and truly understand the situation," Temir says, "I found myself sleeping, eating, sharing cigarettes and daily life with the refugees.
Even the best things that happened destroyed homes and people."
"When you are really close to the war but you are still somewhat safe in your own country, and you see bombs dropping down and people dying and other people applauding this, you can tell this is war tourism."
