The couple lost custody of their children last year.
Josh and Sharyn Hakken are wanted by U.S. authorities and were not in custody in Cuba.
A statement from the Cuban foreign ministry said the boat put in to the marina, located a few miles west of Havana, in bad weather on Sunday.
"Unfortunately, these parents and these poor children, these innocent ones, will now be in a country where there are no laws, there is no redress, and that has been a refuge for fugitives and wanted criminals for many years," Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R- Florida, told CNN.
Last week, the police department in Slidell, Louisiana, issued its own statement offering background on the Hakkens and why the boys were taken from the parents last year.
Sheriff's investigators say Josh Hakken entered Hauser's home at 6:30 a.m. last Wednesday.
That vehicle was found later that day just a couple of blocks away from the home.
