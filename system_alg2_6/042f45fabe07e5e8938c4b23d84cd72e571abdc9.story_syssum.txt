(CNN) -- The exiled leader of the Palestinian Islamic faction Hamas met with Jordan's King Abdullah II on Sunday in his first official trip to Jordan since his expulsion in 1999.
Abdullah reaffirmed his support for a Palestinian state based on the borders drawn before the 1967 Middle East war, "with East Jerusalem as its capital," Petra reported.
Hamas personnel and their families have left Syria in recent weeks, and Ismail Haniya, the Hamas leader in Gaza, did not stop in Damascus during a recent regional trip.
"The Amman talks were about creating a conducive environment for any future talks," Shtayeh said.
