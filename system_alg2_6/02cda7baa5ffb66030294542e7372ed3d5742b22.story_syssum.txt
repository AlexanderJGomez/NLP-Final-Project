They were joined in the last 16 by Manchester City, who thrashed CSKA Moscow 5-2 to remain in second place in the same group with nine points.
CSKA, who were given a partial stadium ban by UEFA for racist chanting aimed at City midfielder Yaya Toure in the reverse fixture in Moscow, which the visitors won 2-1, have only a Europa League place to play for now.
City's neighbors Manchester United stayed top of Group A after a goalless draw at Real Sociedad, but had Marouaune Fellaini sent off in the second half.
Galatasaray must also next travel to Real, who are all but mathematically assured of their place in the knockout stages.
