(EW.com) -- ABC entertainment president Paul Lee says he's going to take a look at the long-gestating Star Wars live-action TV series now that the Disney deal to acquire Lucasfilm is complete.
Even many working in Hollywood don't realize a live-action Star Wars TV series has been sitting on the shelf the past few years.
The Star Wars show was budgeted at more than $5 million per episode and Lucasfilm wanted to retain ownership.
Already one Star Wars-related project is in the works for kids network Disney XD.
But "S.H.I.E.L.D."
Set between the original Star Wars film trilogy and the prequels, the time period allows for all sorts of potential appearances from classic figures from the Star Wars universe.
So if you want to see what the TV show was supposed to look like, check out art from "1313" (one example above).
