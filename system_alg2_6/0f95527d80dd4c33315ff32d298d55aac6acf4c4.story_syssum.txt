Rome (CNN) -- Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta resigned Friday after less than a year in office, according to a statement released by the Italian presidential palace.
The last election to produce a leader was in 2008, when Berlusconi became Prime Minister for a third time.
Since then, all the country's leaders have been appointed.
