A CNN team driving through the city Sunday morning was not able to see a single polling station in operation.
"Despite provocations and violence, millions of Ukrainians went to the polls throughout the country, and even in parts of eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatist groups sought to disenfranchise entire regions, some courageous Ukrainians still were able to cast their ballots," he said in a written statement.
The men, who as Chechens are Russian citizens, said they were there as "volunteers."
The man, named as Andrea Rocchelli, was killed along with a Russian citizen, the ministry said.
Reports suggested there had been mortar fire in the Slovyansk area.
