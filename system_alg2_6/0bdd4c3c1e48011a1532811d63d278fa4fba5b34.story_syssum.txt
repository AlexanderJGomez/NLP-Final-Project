A French engineer and inventor examined the famous painting with a camera of his own design.
"One day I say, if I can find only one hair, only one hair of the eyebrow, I will have definitively the proof that originally Leonardo da Vinci had painted eyelash and eyebrow," said Cotte.
Cotte said the change in position was the result of a lap blanket held by Leonardo's model.
Cotte presented numerous other findings within the infrared layer he photographed.
