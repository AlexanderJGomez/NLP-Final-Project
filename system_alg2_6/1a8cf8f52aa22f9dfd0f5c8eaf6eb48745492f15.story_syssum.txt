The first defense witness called was Sgt.
Padgett was the senior enlisted man on the night shift in the intelligence office where Manning worked.
Padgett testified said he did not discuss the outburst with the major who oversaw the intelligence analysis officers, the company's first sergeant nor the company commander.
For a short time in December 2009, he was an officer in the intelligence analysis office where Manning worked.
The investigating officer overseeing the case granted those ten and two other defense witnesses who were not on the prosecution list.
After that the Investigating Officer, Lt. Col. Paul Almanza, who oversaw the hearing, will consider the testimony and evidence and make a recommendation as to whether Manning should face court martial and if so, on which charges.
Witnesses for the prosecution have characterized Manning as being troubled by Army discipline and testified that he allegedly bragged on the Internet about the leak of classified documents.
Army Criminal Investigation Command Special Agent David Shaver later testified that the chat logs that Lamo provided to the Army largely matched chat logs found on Manning's computer in Iraq.
