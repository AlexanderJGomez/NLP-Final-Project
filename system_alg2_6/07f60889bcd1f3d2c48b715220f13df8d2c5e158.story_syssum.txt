(CNN)There's an old saying which states the Cape Verde Islands are home to a greater number of musicians per square kilometer than any other country in the world.
"The future of our country lies in our capacity to create, our capacity to innovate," Neves said in reference to the music and the arts at a World Trade Organization conference in 2013.
One early musical success has been the Kriol Jazz Festival.
"We breathe the music in Cape Verde, we live with the music," he added.
"We try to invite lots of producers and a lot of journalists from around the world to see the festival and the musicians from Cape Verde," said Jose Da Silva, long time manager of the late Cape Verdean songstress Cesaria Evora.
It must be noted, however, that few countries have the same natural resources for music as Cape Verde.
