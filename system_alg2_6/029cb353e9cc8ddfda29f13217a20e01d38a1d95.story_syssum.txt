Graham told Cooper that she saw her son with a brick in his hand, and she lost control of her emotions and told him to drop it.
You know, once he threw that rock down I said, 'You weren't brought up like this,' " Graham said.
Graham said her son told her the night before the violence at the mall that something was up.
"I was so angry with him that he had made a decision to do some harm to the police officers," she said.
Then the camera captured her memorable smackdown.
I was there to get my child," she said.
Her son said that once they got home from the mall he understood why she pulled him out of the crowd.
