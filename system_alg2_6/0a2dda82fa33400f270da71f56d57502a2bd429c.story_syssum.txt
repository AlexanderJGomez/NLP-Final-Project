(CNN) -- Facebook is expanding its Gift feature to include plastic gift cards that carry balances for multiple stores and restaurants.
The cards will be rolling out gradually for Facebook users in the United States.
Facebook cards aren't compatible with existing mobile payment technology like NFC, QR codes or barcodes that allow people to pay for goods with their mobile phone.
The new product falls somewhere between store-specific cards and bank-issued open gift cards that can be used almost anywhere credit cards are accepted.
A Facebook spokesperson said the company had nothing to share about how it will make money off the Card service.
