"We were waiting and waiting and the call seemed like it would never come," Savage said.
In a tragic mix-up, the Savages say the fertility clinic where Carolyn underwent in vitro fertilization implanted another couple's embryos into Carolyn's uterus.
At the time, Carolyn was 39 and her chances of having a child naturally after this one were waning.
Their second child, born almost three years later in 1997, was 10 weeks premature after Carolyn developed life-threatening complications.
Eventually, Carolyn became pregnant with the couple's third child, resulting in another difficult pregnancy and premature birth.
February 6 was when they thought they had three of their own embryos implanted by the fertility clinic.
They have met with the baby's DNA parents, and according to Carolyn the DNA-related mother of the child has come along for one doctor's appointment.
"As the process has gone along, it has been exceptionally difficult imagining this playing out," Sean Savage said.
Still, even if a surrogate can eventually help them expand their family, the Savages say that the memory of the child they gave up will always linger.
"We gave him up because it was the right thing to do."
