Ayalon singled out the remarks of a Catholic archbishop who said at the conference that Israel is not the Jews' promised land.
"We call on the Vatican to distant themselves from Archbishop Boutros' comments which are a libel against the Jewish People and the State of Israel and should not be construed as the Vatican's official position," Ayalon said in his statement.
"The Palestinian people will thus have an independent and sovereign homeland where they can live with dignity and security," the statement said.
The pope first publicly endorsed a two-state solution to the Middle East crisis during a visit to the region in May 2009.
