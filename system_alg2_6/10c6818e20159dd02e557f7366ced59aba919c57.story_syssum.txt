The Italian international is the focus of racially charged remarks made by Milan vice president Paulo Berlusconi, the younger brother of former prime minister and team owner Silvio Berlusconi.
"It is an insult," Foot told CNN.
Balotelli played for AC's city rivals Inter Milan between 2006 and 2010, during which time he was subjected to racist abuse by Juventus fans during a match in 2009.
Foot thinks how Balotelli responds should such an incident occur again in the future could shape how Italian football tackles racism.
"I think the Boateng incident was really positive because it put the issue on the agenda and said, 'We're not going to take this anymore' and he was backed by the authorities which was really good.
"There hasn't been a debate in Italy about racist language.
"Football is about coming together," the 24-year-old Ghana international told CNN.
"What I would say is please stop this racism because we are all one, we are all human beings.
