Surrounded by guards and by children waving Palestinian flags, he got out, walked over to the wall that separates Israel from its Palestinian neighbors, and he did something remarkably simple but with astonishing power: He prayed.
While Israeli guards looked anxiously down from a nearby tower, wondering what on Earth was going on, Francis touched the wall with his right hand, bent his head, and prayed for several minutes.
It became a refuge for Palestinians at this time, largely under the control of Jordan until the Six Day War in 1967.
Ultimately, Israeli snipers shot dead eight people in or around the church; they wounded at least 22, all of them designated as terrorists by the Israeli army.
One could say that Pope Francis, in turn, follows him as a man who lives without pretense, who understands symbolic gestures.
(In a gesture of reconciliation, the pope did â€” on Monday â€” accede to an Israeli request to pray before a memorial to Israeli victims of the conflict as well.
