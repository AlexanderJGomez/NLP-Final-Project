Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)Government forces and rebels in Yemen agreed to a ceasefire Monday after heavy fighting in the capital, Sanaa, Yemen's interior minister and a rebel official said.
Government officials characterize it as a power grab by the Houthis.
The presidential palace is controlled by the government and mountaintops surrounding the palace are held by rebels known as Houthis, a senior interior ministry official told CNN late Monday.
Prime Minister Khaled Bahah was fired upon when he left a meeting with President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi and the Houthi political group Ansarallah, Al-Sakkaf said.
The senior interior ministry official said the prime minister was inside the Republican palace, some 7 miles (12 kilometers) from the presidential palace.
Adding to the disputes, the information minister said Yemeni state TV and the state-run Saba news agency are now under the control of the Houthi political movement.
Al-Sakkaf said gunmen linked to the Houthi political movement attacked the presidential palace in a bid to take control of the symbol of power.
Osama Sari, senior media adviser to the Houthi movement in Yemen, said the Houthis had detained bin Mubarak as a message to the President.
In September, Houthis signed a ceasefire deal with the government.
