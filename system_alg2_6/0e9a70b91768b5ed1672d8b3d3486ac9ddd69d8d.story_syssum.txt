(CNN) -- The race to the South Pole is off -- although the trek still continues for Prince Harry and teams of wounded veterans.

The participants on Sunday are set to resuming the walk, hoping to traverse the 70 remaining miles to the South Pole "with no stress being placed on the teams ... enabling them all to do this in their own time," Parker explained.
