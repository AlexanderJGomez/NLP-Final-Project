Hu Jintao, the incumbent president and party general secretary, will step down and be replaced by Xi Jinping, the current vice president.
Analysts say Ling, 55, may still be chosen for the Politburo, but he is out of the running for the all-important Standing Committee -- the very highest decision-making body made up of a handful of key leaders.
Ling Gu may have survived the car crash but it seems to have damaged his father's political career and dented the party's reputation.
Ling has been replaced by Li Zhanshu, 62, a provincial party chief who is known to be an ally of Hu and has previous ties with the vice president.
China's leaders are widely seen as divided into two camps: that of retired president Jiang Zemin and that of President Hu.
Others say Hu's camp, known as the Communist Youth League (CYL) faction, referring to the youth organization that Hu headed for years, will dominate the new leadership.
"The lineup of the Standing Committee and the full Politburo will show that the CYL remains the largest faction," said Willy Lam, a China expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
