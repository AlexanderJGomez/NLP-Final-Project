Los Angeles (CNN) -- Charlie Sheen plans to return to work on his hit sitcom "Two and a Half Men" by the end of February, his representative said Thursday.
Sheen was "very, very intoxicated, also apparently in a lot of pain" last Thursday morning, according to a 911 call from a doctor who had just talked to the actor.
"I got him on the phone and he was very, very intoxicated, also apparently in a lot of pain," Nassif said on the 911 call.
Sheen and now ex-wife Brooke Mueller were married in Nassif's Beverly Hills home, Nassif said.
CNN's Kareen Wynter contributed to this report.
