(CNN) -- After nearly going to war last year over a Colombian military raid inside Ecuador, the two nations seemed to be patching relations when their foreign ministers met a few weeks ago.
Two former U.S. ambassadors to the area agree this is par for Ecuadorian foreign policy.
Tension between the two nations has existed for years.
After the meeting, Colombia signed a statement saying it would never attack inside Ecuador again.
Falconi quickly pointed out that the nation's judicial branch, not Correa's administration, decided to issue the warrant.
Alejandro Santos, editorial director of La Semana weekly news magazine in Colombia, said relations will not improve until the two countries "can close the chapter" on last year's bombing raid.
"Now Ecuador needs to start avoiding those types of judicial measures against Colombian officials."
The problems between the two nations are long-standing and have a lot to do with the 45-year-old war between Colombia and the FARC.
Chavez threatened to attack neighboring Colombia after the military raid in Ecuador.
Said Spurrier, "For Colombia, Ecuador is an important market.
"I hope this passes ... and that they start talking again."
