Boston (CNN)The death penalty trial of accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev -- long delayed by painstaking jury selection, crippling snowstorms and last-ditch appeals to move the case someplace else -- is on track to get underway here next week.
The jurors first will decide whether Tsarnaev is guilty of using weapons of mass destruction to kill people at a large public event.
Tsarnaev also is charged in the April 19, 2013, death of MIT police officer Sean Collier.
But this case is being tried in federal court, and 17 of the 30 counts against Tsarnaev include the death penalty as a possible punishment.
It is almost certain that the trial, which will include wrenching testimony and video footage of the bombing victims, will be well underway during the running of this year's Boston Marathon on April 20.
