The Beaver Creek Fire has burned some 100,916 acres, up from nearly 93,000 on Saturday and 64,000 acres on Friday.
Approximately 1,200 firefighters are working the blaze, with the help of helicopters, bulldozers and conventional engines, Dane said.
They said, 'It's mandatory.'
"As some of the other large fires in Idaho such as the Elk Fire have ramped down, we have been able to transfer a lot of resources from there to the Beaver Creek Fire," said Jennifer Mislivy, a fire spokeswoman.
CNN's Paul Vercammen and Dana Ford contributed to this report.
