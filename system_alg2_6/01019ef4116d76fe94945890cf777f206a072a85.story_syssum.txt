New York City Criminal Court Judge ShawnDya L. Simpson ruled Wednesday that there was no evidence that former New York Supreme Court Judge Frank Barbaro acted with bias toward the defendant when the verdict was rendered.
Barbaro, now 86, said in an exclusive interview with CNN this year, "I couldn't get out of my mind the look on the lawyer's face when I said I found him guilty.
Kagan's lawyer, Richard Mischel, said he plans to appeal Simpson's decision.
"It's not just about getting him out of jail; it's about rectifying a wrong," Mischel said.
