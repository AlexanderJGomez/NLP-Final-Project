Again.
As crazy as it sounds, Musk is merely updating an idea that's been around since the early 1900s, and at least one company is working on a functional prototype.
The Hyperloop is it.
The company, which calls itself an "open consortium," claims that it's working with partners in China and has sold nearly 100 licenses for the technology.
Sources close to the Tesla co-founder and CEO say he believes ET3 is on the right track, but is missing some key components, and that Musk has his hands full with Tesla and SpaceX, and would rather have some involvement in the development, with another entity taking the helm.
"Will publish Hyperloop as open source."
