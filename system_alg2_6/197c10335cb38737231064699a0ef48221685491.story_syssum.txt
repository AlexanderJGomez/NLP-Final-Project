Brittany is believed to be with Easley, who met the girl's mother on the internet, authorities said.
"As to what relationship Jeff Easley and Brittany may have between them is irrelevant," Lavinder said.
Authorities launched a search for the seventh-grader Monday after officers found the body of Brittany's mother, Tina Smith, 41, inside the family's Salem home.
A friend of Brittany Smith told the Roanoke Times that the missing girl called her several weeks ago.
Police are "confident" that the girl is with Easley, Lavinder said.
Nobody seemed to know where she was," said Roanoke County Police Lt. Chuck Mason Monday, according to CNN affiliate WSET of Lynchburg, Virginia, adding that police were concerned her disappearance "has something to do with the homicide."
They have asked anyone with information to call 911 or Roanoke County police at 540-777-8641.
