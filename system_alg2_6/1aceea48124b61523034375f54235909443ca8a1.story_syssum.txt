Chad Schaffner, 37, was arrested in Kingdom City, Missouri, about 2:45 p.m. Saturday, said Missouri State Highway Patrol radio operator Paula Price.
Schaffner faces charges including bank robbery in Tennessee; burglary in Indiana; armed robbery in Illinois; and receiving stolen property in Ohio, Price said.
Schaffner will appear in court Monday in Jefferson City, Missouri, according to Bridget Patton, spokeswoman for the FBI's Kansas City, Missouri, office.
"This guy has made no effort to hide the gun," said FBI agent Kevin Keithley last month.
Two bank robberies occurred in Morristown and Jefferson City, Tennessee, on August 18, authorities said.
He had threatened to kill the children if she told agents he was there, the woman said.
