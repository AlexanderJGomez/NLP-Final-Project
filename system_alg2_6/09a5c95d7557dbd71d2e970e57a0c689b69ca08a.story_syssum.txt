The alerts about a blue Nissan -- possibly carrying Ethan Anderson, 8, and sister Hannah Anderson, 16 -- were the first sent statewide in California under a new program that sends Amber Alerts about abducted children via text messages to millions of mobile phones.
But people had to sign up to receive the alerts -- only about 700,000 did -- and then designate the areas they wanted to get alerts for.
And people must opt out if they prefer not to get the alerts.
Carriers representing 98% of all U.S. wireless subscribers are on the new program, and more than 200 models of phones support the alerts, said Brian Josef, an assistant vice president for regulatory affairs at CTIA, the wireless industry trade association.
Monday's alert was the third Amber Alert in California in 2013 to use the new system, although the first two were only broadcast to phones in specific counties.
"The fact that the alerts were broadcast indiscriminately to San Diego-area cellphones (and later, to all California phones capable of receiving text messages, as the alert went statewide) clearly annoyed a lot of wireless customers," he wrote.
