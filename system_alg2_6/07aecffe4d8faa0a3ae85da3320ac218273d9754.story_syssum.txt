(CNN) -- There's a standard Atlantic City itinerary: arrive at one of the many casinos along the Boardwalk, head straight for the card tables and slot machines, drink some complimentary cocktails and proceed to empty your wallet.
Sure, Atlantic City's casinos offer a glut of nightclubs and ritzy bars with bottle service and pounding sound systems.
Just south of town, in Margate, sits Lucy the Elephant, a six-story high National Historic Landmark.
Today, visitors can take guided tours inside the novelty pachyderm.
Admission is $7 for adults, $4 for children ages 4 to 12, free for children younger than 4.
It's located right on the waterfront at historic Gardner's Basin, where you can dine at dockside restaurants and check out the Atlantic City artists' colony.
There are two art park locations, both an easy walk from the casinos, one between Martin Luther King Boulevard and Indiana Avenue and another on the Boardwalk at California Avenue.
There is plenty to do inside Atlantic City's casinos besides gambling.
The Pier Shops at Caesars is another area where you can spend a few hours away from the casino floor eating, shopping or watching The Water Show, a Vegas-style water, light and sound extravaganza that pops off once every hour (check with the hotel first, it is occasionally out of service).
This summer, free events such as a concert by country singer Blake Shelton (July 31) and AVP pro volleyball (September 5-7) will take place along the Boardwalk.
