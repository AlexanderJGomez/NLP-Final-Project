(CNN)  -- A paramedic accused of plotting to extort $25 million from actor John Travolta after his 16-year-old son died in the Bahamas told a jury Wednesday the boy had been dead for some time before the ambulance service was called.
The paramedic, however, asked Travolta to sign a statement releasing the ambulance company from liability.
At the hospital, the actor was told his son "wasn't alive," he said.
Lightbourn said Wednesday that he asked attorney Bridgewater to assist him in negotiations with Travolta's attorneys.
Travolta's attorney testified the negotiations between Lightbourn and himself were all part of the Bahamian police sting.
Travolta and his wife, actress Kelly Preston, are not expected back in court.
