(CNN) -- A Utah judge has ordered a registered sex offender who faces nearly two dozen charges of child sex abuse released on the basis that he is mentally incompetent to stand trial.
"I am outraged that a convicted child sex offender, currently facing another round of accusations, could be released without being tried for current charges," Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert said.
"What I wanted to do was jump over and take care of it myself,'' said Christy Danner, whose daughter is an alleged victim of Johnson.
Johnson's family has maintained his innocence, alleging the accusations are related to a bitter divorce case.
