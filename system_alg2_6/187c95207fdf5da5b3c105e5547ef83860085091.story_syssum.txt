Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- Hundreds of people fled a pro-Alassane Ouattara neighborhood in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, where forces loyal to incumbent President Laurent Gbabgbo have been fighting an armed Ouattara supporters for the past week.
Ouattara is holed up in the Golf hotel in Abidjan under the protection of U.N. peacekeepers.
Army spokesman Col. Babri Gohourou said on national television that the police officer went to the U.N. camp to negotiate the release of three Gbagbo supporters who were arrested during a demonstration.
Gohourou said the U.N. peacekeepers shot the officer in the back while he was bringing the three young men away from the camp.
