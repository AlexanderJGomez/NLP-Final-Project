(CNN) -- HTC's new flagship smartphone, the One, is an impressive bit of hardware and a big step forward for the company in three significant ways.
"We think about the One X and we think 'Wow, it was big, and it was one of the best phones we've ever done,'" Scott Croyle, HTC's vice president of design, said.
And there's a focus in the new Sense on making things that users commonly do easier and more intuitive â€” such as sifting through social media and news apps, or snapping photos and video.
So, for the One, we really had to get it right, we really had to just go for it."
While the One won't replace your Jambox anytime soon, its onboard speakers sound immensely better than anything we've heard from a phone.
Along with all new hardware, HTC is using the One to introduce an all new take on Android.
And the app can be connected to Twitter, Facebook, Flickr and other social networks as well.
While BlinkFeed is a pre-installed app, it's also the default view any One user will see once they unlock their phone.
All too often, a great phone, like last year's One X, was confined to a limited audience due to carriers wanting exclusive rights to phones.
