But even while Clinton was in Beijing, the Chinese government was maintaining a heated diplomatic back-and-forth on another territorial controversy, this one concerning a set of small islands in the East China Sea also claimed by Japan and Taiwan.
Some Japanese media outlets reported Wednesday that the Japanese government had agreed to buy the islands from the family, a claim the government's chief Cabinet secretary, Osamu Fujimura, declined to confirm, saying talks on the matter were continuing.
Chinese officials said Xi would send a letter to Clinton.
"Both President Obama and I have said frequently that the United States welcomes the rise of a strong, prosperous and peaceful China," she said Wednesday.
The territorial disputes over islands in the South China Sea complicate that role.
"While the likelihood of major conflict remains low, all of the trends are in the wrong direction, and prospects of resolution are diminishing," the International Crisis Group said in a July report.
