The Affordable Care Act makes health care more affordable for senior citizens and ensures that doctors are compensated fairly for their services.
A vital home care work force has developed to meet these needs, and its interests are inextricably bound to the future of health care.
The work force can barely meet the current need for care, supports and services, let alone what's to come.
The Affordable Care Act was a great leap forward in improving a health care system that isn't working well for senior citizens, workers or any of us.
But if the justices would just think of themselves as senior citizens and soon-to-be-seniors, they would uphold the Affordable Care Act for the sake of older Americans, care workers and our shared future.
