Each year the tuition goes up, students bring out banners and loudspeakers, shave their heads, take over the university president's office and use other creative methods to get the schools to cut back on tuition.
Stories of students and fathers committing suicide due to the pressure of tuition circulated in the local media earlier this year, and students are frustrated with President Lee Myung-bak for not having kept his campaign promise to reduce college tuition by half if he was voted into power.
Lee said, after her freshman year, she wasn't sure she wanted to continue pursuing a university education.
At least for tuition fees I can take out loans for now," said Lee.
By the time she graduates, Lee will have accumulated nearly $32,000 in student loans.
I think everyone needs to come together with their opinion so that our voices are heard, and I think it's important that everyone takes action together," she said.
