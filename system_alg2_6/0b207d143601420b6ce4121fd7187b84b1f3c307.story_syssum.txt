Fifty years since the film crews left, following in Lawrence, and later Lean's, footsteps can still reveal some of Jordan's finest desert jewels.
In the south of modern day Jordan, 300km from capital city, Amman, near the border with Saudi Arabia, the landscape appears unchanged from the scenes described by Lawrence -- the same landscape which Lean used as the backdrop for the Englishman's first encounter with Alec Guinness' Prince Faisal -- in what is now a protected UNESCO World Heritage Site.
At the other edge of the desert lies in the far south of the country, lies Jordan's tiny Red Sea coast and the coastal fortress which would make Lawrence famous.
Far from the path of most tourists, says Teller, the fortress -- including Lawrence's room above the gateway -- are now guarded by the direct descendants of those who provided refuge to Lawrence and Faisal's army.
When Lawrence arrived in Jordan in 1916, Amman was a village, home to the ruins of Roman, Byzantine and Islamic civilizations and a new train station on the Ottoman Hejaz Railway.
But, Teller says: "This very beautiful old building was (British Arab Legion Commander) Frederick Peake's house, and the story goes that when Lawrence was a guest of Peake in the early twenties, this house was where he wrote some, or all, of 'Seven Pillars of Wisdom.'"
