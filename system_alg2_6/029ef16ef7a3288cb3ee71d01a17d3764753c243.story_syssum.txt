(CNN) -- The mother of a Brooklyn teenager shot and killed by police demanded an investigation Thursday, saying he was "slaughtered" and that she wants to know why.
As the officers got closer, Kimani Gray broke from the group and adjusted his waistband.
Kimani Gray then "turned on them," it said, and pointed a .38-caliber revolver at the officers.
Most people in the city likely don't believe what police say happened Saturday, said Councilman Charles Barron, who appeared with the teen's mother at the news conference.
Police said they arrested two people that day.
The police were caught off-guard," Graham said.
"I can promise you that we will conduct a full and fair investigation," he said.
"As a black man growing up in Flatbush, you just expect to be harassed by the cops, pulled over, arrested and now just straight up killed," said Shanduke McPhatter, a 35-year-old former gang member who works with young men in the neighborhood.
"There are no community centers here," McPhatter said.
Otherwise, this is just going to keep happening."
