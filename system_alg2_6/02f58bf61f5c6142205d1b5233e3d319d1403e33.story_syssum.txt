With "The Simpsons," I thought, "Hang on a second, they've been around for years but none of the characters have any themes really."

I thought, "I want to find the most benign, banal music and sort of savage it up and make it our battle music."
That would be good here?
HZ: I go there.
The wind on telegraph wires is a great sound; get it into your machine and play it and it becomes interesting.

I took the first one, 'Circle of Life,' and made up my mind there were two ways I could approach it: I could either be really respectful of Elton's notes and what he had done, and very slavishly try to orchestrate it, or I could try to make it my own, usurp it, throw my stuff at it and go crazy, which is pretty much what I did.

The movie and the score are truly one and it gives you an incredibly complete experience.
