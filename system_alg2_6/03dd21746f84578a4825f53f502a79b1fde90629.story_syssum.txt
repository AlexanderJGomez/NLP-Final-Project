Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- At least three people were killed and 174 injured during clashes in Egypt on Sunday, officials said, exactly one year after the country's first democratically elected president came to power.
The Tamarod, or "rebel," campaign, a large movement led by opponents of the president, has spent months collecting signatures on a petition calling for Morsy to step down and call new elections.
Morsy's opponents stood their ground in the square, where protests two years ago helped topple Mubarak's 29-year rule.
Supporters gathered at the presidential palace in Tahrir Square and in Rabaa Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo's eastern suburb of Nasr City on Sunday.
Before the death reported Sunday, clashes had already claimed at least eight lives, including associates of the Muslim Brotherhood whose offices came under attack.
Two people were shot dead Thursday when armed men attacked Muslim Brotherhood offices in Zagazig, Morsy's hometown, the spokesman said.
State media reported that protesters demanding Morsy's ouster ransacked the city's offices of his Freedom and Justice Party, the Muslim Brotherhood's political wing.
But Morsy is not Mubarak.
The United States has approved the departure of embassy and consulate employees and their dependents because of the unrest, a senior State Department official said.
