Vitali Klitschko has confirmed that he will defend his world heavyweight boxing title against former champion Shannon Briggs on October 16 in his adopted home city of Hamburg.
"For a long time I have been trying hard to fight a Klitschko.
Britain's WBA beltholder David Haye, who both Klitschkos have accused of being scared to fight them, may next fight former Olympic champion Audley Harrison, according to promoter Barry Hearn.
People don't know what to expect from Audley Harrison, he's been talking a great fight for years, never delivered it.
