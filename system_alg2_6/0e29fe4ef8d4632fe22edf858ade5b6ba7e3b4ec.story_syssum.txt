Washington (CNN) -- It was my first chance to spend some quality time at dinner with First Lady Michelle Obama, so I decided to do what my pal Ali Velshi would probably do in the same situation: get her hooked on Twitter.
Noting that Gibbs was sitting at the other end of the head table, I stood and told the first lady I'd ask him.
I assured the first lady I would not tell her a fib, which prompted Leno to jump to his feet to say he'd go get Gibbs to sort this out once and for all.
I started my typing "from flotus," as in "first lady of the United States."
She asked Gibbs for his opinion on what she had dictated, and he said the proper way to say it was that it was her first tweet.
Besides, I'm hoping Mrs. Obama will follow me, and not Velshi, since I hooked her up with her first tweet.
