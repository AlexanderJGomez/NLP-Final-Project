The brother of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri is proposing to mediate a peace deal between the West and Islamists.
He wants peace, he says, between Muslims and non-Muslims and has written a proposal that outlines the terms.
He says he's offering to be an intermediary between Islamists and the United States and the West.
His six-page proposal offers a 10-year truce if the following terms are met.
He says he told his interrogators he could work a truce with Islamists but he says his jailers didn't want to know.
He says his brother will listen to him, but admits he hasn't talked to him in long over a decade.
It wouldn't be the first time the terms are unacceptably high.
