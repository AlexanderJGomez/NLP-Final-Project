Hong Kong (CNN) -- Featuring everything from hand-painted heels to a live (and semi-naked) woman, Hong Kong's latest art fair wrapped Sunday with sales topping HK$39 million ($5 million) -- up 50% on last year's inaugural event.
Visitors could also satisfy their creative urges by trying their hand at Chinese painting and collage.
"People are very intimidated by the idea of going to galleries and each city we go to we help to break down those perceived barriers and get people understanding that there's art out there that they can afford -- and that art can be for everyone," he adds.
If you missed the show in Hong Kong, you can always hit the Affordable Art Fair at one of its upcoming global tour stops.
