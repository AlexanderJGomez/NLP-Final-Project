"Our team played in the spirit of Seve without ever giving up," Olazabal said.
"The thing that Europe had -- distinct to the United States -- was the notion of playing for Seve, and teams are often at their best when playing for an idea," says Tu, whose book 'Superteams' will be published next month.
The 46-year-old may have lacked the organizational ability of previous European captain Colin Montgomerie, whose side triumphed in another nail biting clash in Wales two years ago, but he compensated in other areas, says Tu.
"Olazabal did do some interesting structural things -- such as choosing Poulter as a wild card," says Tu.
"This would have liberated Kaymer -- and just look at the way both he and Stricker handled the pressure in their clash late on.
"A lot of small things combined to tip Europe into the belief they could win and as the scores came through, their momentum became unstoppable.
"If it were just this U.S. team that lost when on paper it seemed to have the better players, the blame might be easier to assign.
