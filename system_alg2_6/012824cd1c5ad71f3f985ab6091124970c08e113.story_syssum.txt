He was also convicted of two counts of sexual assault for attacks on two other women.
A pair of panties that did not belong to Denison were found near the body, in what police said was a "calling card" that helped them connect Biela not only to Denison, but also to the other assaults.
The second woman, a student at the university, testified she was abducted outside her apartment and driven to a dark area and raped in the attacker's vehicle.
Police released a photo of the panties near Denison's body and a description of the pickup truck.
