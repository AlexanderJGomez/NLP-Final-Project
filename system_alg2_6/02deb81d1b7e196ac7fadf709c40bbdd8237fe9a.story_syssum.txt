(CNN) -- Investors of Russian assets have had their first real chance to assess the situation in Ukraine and they didn't like what they saw.
While this is being positioned domestically in Russia as a move by President Vladimir Putin on behalf of Russians in the east of Ukraine, the military action probably will not sit well with those in the middle class who took to the streets over the past year.
At the World Energy Congress in South Korea late last year, the energy minister Alexander Novak spelled out plans for Russian reserves to expand handsomely over the coming years.
Executives at Gazprom, Russia's state-run gas giant, have declared that Ukraine is one and a half billion dollars in arrears on payments and that discounts given to the previous, pro-Moscow government expire at the end of the month.
About a third of Russia's daily oil output of nearly ten million barrels a day goes to Europe as well.
