(CNN)  -- E. Lynn Harris, the author who introduced millions of readers to the "invisible life" of black gay men, was a literary pioneer whose generosity was as huge as his courage, friends said Friday.
Though Harris wrote primarily about black gay men, some of his biggest fans were black women.
Tina McElroy Ansa, author of "Taking After Mudear," met Harris at the beginning of his literary career when he was selling his first book "Invisible Life."
"It was playful, loving, and it wasn't hidden."
''When I wrote "Invisible Life," it had to be the first book out of me -- it helped me to deal with my own sexuality,'' Harris said.
"You could get trampled at an E. Lynn Harris reading," Ansa said.
Boykin says Harris was stung by some of the criticism.
Boykin said Harris received most of his criticism not from outraged straight critics, but people within the black community.
Harris took a little of that pain away with his life and his books.
"He helped us all breathe a little better."
