Thousands of vehicles fled Swat Valley on Sunday, where up to 15,000 Pakistani troops are preparing to move against approximately 5,000 Taliban militants, a regional official said.
The military has been releasing regular reports saying it has killed Taliban militants in the region, but it has produced little evidence of the successes it claims.
The 175-kilometer (110-mile) journey from Mingora to the western city of Peshawar normally takes about three hours by car.
In other developments, a suicide car bomber attacked a Pakistani paramilitary checkpoint outside Peshawar on Monday, killing a Frontier Corps soldier and three civilians, said Ali Sher Khan, a Corps spokesman.
