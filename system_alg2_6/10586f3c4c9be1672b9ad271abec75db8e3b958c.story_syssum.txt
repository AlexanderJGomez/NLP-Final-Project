WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama has accepted the resignation of Louis Caldera, the director of the White House Military Office responsible for the controversial low-altitude flyover of New York by a 747 plane used as Air Force One, the White House said Friday.
In the report, the White House said Caldera, who had been traveling with President Obama when the flyover plans were initially discussed, did not remember a conversation in which his deputy, George Mulligan, informed him of the flyover.
The flyover, officials said, was a training mission -- it was also a government-sanctioned photo shoot.
As it nears, they begin to run.
Anna Carpenter, local law enforcement agencies and the FAA had been notified of the exercise.
