But, family members say, Nehemiah Griego is no monster.
The family disputed any media characterization that the teen was a loner and said he had many friends and was a wrestler in state tournaments.
What we do agree on is that those who wish to score political points should not use a confused, misguided, 15-year-old boy to make their case," the family statement said.
He was arrested Saturday night, after deputies found the bodies of his mother, father, brother and two of his sisters in their home on the outskirts of Albuquerque.
"Nehemiah stated his brother became upset, so he shot his brother in the head with the same rifle used to kill his mother."
He even sent his girlfriend a picture of his slain mother, Houston said.
Pastor Skip Heitzig said father Greg Griego was also a pastor for a number of years who did prison ministry at the Metropolitan Detention Center and helped to rehabilitate convicts.
His church, Calvary Albuquerque, is scheduled to hold a prayer vigil Wednesday at 7 p.m. for the Griego family.
