(CNN) -- California's vote on a controversial cigarette tax remained too close to call Wednesday morning, although votes counted so far suggest it was narrowly rejected.
About three-quarters of the money raised would go to cancer research.
About $12 million was raised in support of the initiative, including $8.5 million from the American Cancer Society and $1.5 million from the Lance Armstrong Foundation, known as Livestrong.
29 said it would "save lives, stop kids from smoking, and fund cancer research," while those opposed said the initiative "doesn't require revenue be spent in California to create jobs or fund schools."
