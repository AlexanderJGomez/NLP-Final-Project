House mice not native to the island are threatening the Tristan albatross with extinction, the RSPB said.
The mice on the island eat the chicks of the albatross and bunting before they make it to the fledgling stage, the RSPB said.
A survey of the albatross on Gough Island in January showed 1,764 adults incubating eggs, the RSPB said.
"Without urgent conservation action to remove the mice, both the albatross and the bunting are living on borrowed time."
Tristan albatrosses are one of 22 species of albatross in the world.
The birds can fly thousands of miles without a pause, and their only need to touch land is to nest and raise their young, the RSPB says.
