Though it sounds like behavior at one of the health care town hall meetings last month, it was how some Republicans reacted to President Obama's speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday night.
The most memorable moment came from Rep. Joe Wilson, R-South Carolina, who shouted "You lie" after the president said that a Democratic-sponsored health care bill would not cover illegal immigrants.
Hunt said there is still a lot of misunderstanding among Republican members of Congress.
"I think he feels the way a lot of people in South Carolina feel about [health care reform].
"There were folks on both sides raising issues, asking questions."
It's time for us to talk about health care and not Mr. Wilson," she said.
You expect that a lot more from Rep. DeMint [Republican from South Carolina] than Wilson for sure," O'Connor added.
Ornstein added that Wilson's comment was an "incredibly dumb thing to do" for the broader picture of the Republican Party.
