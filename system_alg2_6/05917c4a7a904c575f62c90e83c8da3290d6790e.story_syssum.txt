(CNN) -- Women undergoing in-vitro fertilization should have only one or two embryos transferred during the process, depending on their age, says a study published Wednesday in the British medical journal The Lancet.
These two findings led authors to conclude that women who are 40 and older should have two embryos transferred per IVF cycle, while younger women should have only one embryo transferred, and no patients should have more than three embryos transferred at one time.
According to Schattman, a woman's age is the most important factor in terms of pregnancy outcome but needs to be looked as a continuous variable.
He says transferring three embryos is a valid practice if certain factors are in play, including a woman's age, the number of failed IVF cycles she has already experienced and the quality of her embryo.
You really want to adjust the number of embryos ... to not only maximize the chance of achieving a pregnancy but to counter that with a desire to reduce multiple births."
