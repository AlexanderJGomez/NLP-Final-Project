(CNN) -- Drew ushered Jackie into a bedroom, shutting the door behind them.
"Its."
The article continues: Jackie's friends, two guys and one woman, ultimately decided she shouldn't be taken to the hospital or report the rape because if she did, "her reputation will be shot for the next four years."
On the day the Rolling Stone article about Jackie's alleged rape was published, Caitlin Kelly, a Web producer at The New Yorker, wrote a string of tweets imagining what it would look like if people responded to her wallet being stolen the way they respond to rape.
Just curious, just trying to get a better sense of what's going on here.

" Could you imagine Drew parading around like nothing had happened if he'd just committed a murder?
On the other hand, Drew, as of the writing of the Rolling Stone article, was set to graduate, entirely untarnished -- as were the other men involved in the alleged rape.

If UVA has any sense of moral rightness and wishes to remain a great university, it should conduct a thorough investigation into these and similar allegations and mete out appropriate punishment for the perpetuators.
