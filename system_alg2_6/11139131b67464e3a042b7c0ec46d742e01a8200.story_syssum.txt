But when he saw the devastation in other areas of the country, he wanted to do all he could to help his fellow Filipinos.
So he reached halfway around the world to Doc Hendley, a North Carolina clean-water activist who had also been honored as a top 10 CNN Hero in 2009.
Soon, Hendley was on a flight to the Philippines with hundreds of water filters in tow.
"When we got to the communities, they were asking for help," he said.
Hendley said they will have distributed 2,000 filters by the end of the week.
Penaflorida returned home Wednesday to focus on a new project: bringing his pushcart classrooms to the devastated areas to help educate children while the communities rebuild.
Hendley now plans to provide water filters to Lim so she can distribute them to the women and children she is helping.
"CNN Heroes are like family, and I'm glad that my fellow Heroes have immediately responded," he said.
