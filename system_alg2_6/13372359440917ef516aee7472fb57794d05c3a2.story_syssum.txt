Along The Libya-Tunisia Border (CNN) -- A green flag fluttering in the wind designated Libyan territory.
The U.N. refugee agency reported that nearly 150,000 people have crossed over from Libya into Tunisia and Egypt.
Now what for the Egyptian refugee?
The Egyptian government has reported 69,000 people crossing into that nation.
It's easier for Egyptian workers to make it back home, Luciano said, but nonetheless, they face a difficult situation.
"As we know, Egypt is also under a lot of stress now politically," said Hovig Etyemezian, a field officer with the U.N. refugee agency.
"The biggest priority is to take people out of the country," Etyemezian said.
Tunisian authorities told the agency that about 75,000 people have streamed into Tunisia.
They may be targets for retribution after reports that embattled Gadhafi recruited mercenaries from those nations to suppress the uprising in his country.
