(CNN) -- It's been more than a week since Brown University student Sunil Tripathi was last seen, but authorities appear to be no closer to knowing where he is.
According to his family, the FBI is assisting in the investigation, which is being led by the Providence Police Department.
"Our concerns are first and foremost with Sunil and his family," said Margaret Klawunn, vice president for student life and campus services at Brown University.
