From the time I married my husband when my stepdaughter was only 4 years old, I always felt she viewed me as his wife rather than as a stepmother.
Being wished a Happy Mother's Day by my parents and friends also felt bad.
Thankfully, my feelings have changed and, now I am in a better place where I accept and understand why my stepdaughter will not reach out to me on Mother's Day.
No matter how hard I tried to get close to her, I felt like a distant relative.
More important, I received the necessary support from women sharing similar experiences.
These women also helped me understand that my desire to be acknowledged by my stepdaughter on Mother's Day was not unreasonable, but it might be too much for her to give me.
After doing some research, I also learned that only 20% of stepchildren feel close to their stepmothers.
While my husband used to encourage my stepdaughter to wish me a Happy Mother's Day, she is an adult, and he can't control her actions.
I hope my experiences can help other stepmothers have a more enjoyable Mother's Day.
