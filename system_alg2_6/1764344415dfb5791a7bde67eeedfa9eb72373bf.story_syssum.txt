LONDON, England (CNN)  -- They left home with hope in their hearts, thousands of fans true to the Liverpool anthem, dreaming of reaching another Wembley FA Cup Final.

For the second time in four years I had gone to cover a football match and ended up filing a disaster report.
People who came to watch a football match went home haunted by scenes of carnage and chaos that will stay with them for the rest of their lives.
Many questioned why the kickoff to the game had not been delayed.
Gerrard was six weeks away from his ninth birthday at the time of tragedy.
On that occasion they returned home with hope in their hearts.
