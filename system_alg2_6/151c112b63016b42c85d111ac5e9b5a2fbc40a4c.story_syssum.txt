The 24-year-old was convicted and sentenced on charges of having unlawful sex, making a false statement and illegal consumption of alcohol.
That was pretty much the last thing she said she remembers before the alleged sexual assault.
That is what you do.
She was then taken to Bur Dubai police station, she said.
An Arabic speaker told her it listed two charges against her: one for sex outside of marriage and the other for public consumption of alcohol.
Subsequently, she said her manager advised her to tell the police it was voluntary sexual intercourse and likely the whole issue would just go away.
But a representative of Al Mana Interiors, who Dalelv worked for, told CNN that she was not advised by her manager to say the sex was consensual but rather by a police officer, who told her that in Arabic and it was translated into English by her manager.
Dalelv was convicted Tuesday on all three charges and was sentenced to one year in jail for having unlawful sex, three months in jail for making a false statement and one month for illegal consumption of alcohol.
Norwegian Foreign Affairs Minister Espen Barth Eide called his UAE counterpart, Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed al-Nahyan, on Friday night to protest Dalelv's sentencing, a statement from the Norwegian ministry said.
Dalelv told CNN she received a call from Eide on Friday reiterating Norway's support.
She was charged with public intoxication and having sex outside of marriage.
