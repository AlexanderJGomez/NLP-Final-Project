Marcus Schrenker was taken to a hospital after being found Tuesday near Quincy, Florida, authorities say.
Authorities also found a book of campsites -- also with the Alabama and Florida pages ripped out -- near the plane, according to the affidavit.
Schrenker is also charged with willfully damaging, destroying or wrecking an aircraft.
Indiana officials have agreed to allow the federal case against Schrenker to proceed before seeking to have him extradited to Indiana, according to a statement from the U.S. attorney's office in the Northern District of Florida.
Quincy is about 215 miles southeast of Childersburg, Alabama, where Schrenker was first spotted after authorities believe he bailed out of the aircraft.
When police, who identified Schrenker using his FAA pilot's license, heard about the crash and returned, they found that he had checked in under a false name and had since disappeared, possibly into a nearby wooded area, authorities said.
Michelle Schrenker contacted her last summer to discuss a divorce because he was having an affair, Schmid said in a statement.
But the affair continued, and Michelle Schrenker filed for divorce December 30, the attorney said.
