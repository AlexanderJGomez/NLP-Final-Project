Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's decision to seek congressional authorization of a military attack against the Syrian government is in part his way of trying to fix a legal problem.
Congressional approval wouldn't solve the problem with international law, a senior administration official said, but it would enhance the legitimacy of military action.
A senior administration official acknowledged the international legal constraints but said the president is authorized to take action with or without Congress, in part for U.S. national security reasons.
The administration's proposed authorization for action in Syria is broad and open-ended, and many lawmakers emerged from briefings with deep misgivings.
John Bellinger, former legal adviser to the State Department and the National Security Council under President George W. Bush, said Obama's international law problem is of his own making.
The United States and other nations have been reluctant to accept such a broad change, Bellinger said.
Obama has long grappled with the issue of how to deal with civil war atrocities when international law doesn't offer a way to stop them.
That's why all responsible nations must embrace the role that militaries with a clear mandate can play to keep the peace."
