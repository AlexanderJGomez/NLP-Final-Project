Speaking this week at the Cheltenham Literature Festival in the UK,  to promote her new book "The Shock Doctrine," Klein attacked the "Bono-ization" of the protest movement, referring to U2 frontman Bono who is also an active anti-poverty campaigner.
What's significant about the Seattle movement (the WTO protests in 1999 and 2000) is that it's less the tactics but the fact that it identifies that there are real power differences, winners and losers in this economic model."
But now but according to Klein, the rise in blogging and on-line protests has taken the heat out of direct action.
American Express, Converse, Armani and Gap were initial partners, joined later by Apple and Motorola.
There's nothing that's inherently wrong with these initiatives except when they make radical claims that it's going to end poverty.
What I see from the Bono camp is that they dismiss street protest as bunch as gripers whereas they (Bono) are being constructive because they engaging with power (but) if you look at the history of the labor movement its people outside trying to enforce change."
Yet he does see the value in having people working with power to effect change: "The classic model of social change is that you need people on the inside talking to people in power and people on the outside shaking up the establishment -- a combination of the two getting results.
