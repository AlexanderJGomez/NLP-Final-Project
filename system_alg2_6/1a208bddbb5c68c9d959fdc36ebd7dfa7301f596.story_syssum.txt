Errand Frazier of Vero Beach wasn't quite sure what to do at first when he heard purring coming from his Chevy pickup, parked outside his house in late May.
Taking matters into his own hands, he reached for his toolbox, took out some sheet metal cutters and cut back the metal on the side of the truck bed.
Frazier could see that the cat was under the bed of his truck, lodged in the frame, and he couldn't get to it.
"I said, 'Ma'am, there's a kitten that hitchhiked from my home and I can't get it,"" Frazier said.
On Friday, the Humane Society set up a special "kitty truck fund" to help Frazier.
On Friday, the couple said they weren't worried about the truck and hoped people would just donate to the humane society to help other animals.
"That's the reason that little kitten just showed up here -- because God knew we would do whatever we needed to do to make sure that kitten was safe."
