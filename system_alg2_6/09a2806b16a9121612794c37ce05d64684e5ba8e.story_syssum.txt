I said it was economic, but political in the sense that you have a political party -- the GOP -- entrenched with the wealthy and Wall Street while doing nothing to protect middle-class America.
It is personal.
When there is this kind of disparity while these same CEOs are paying taxes at a rate lower than their secretaries, their receptionists, and the people who clean their offices, it is personal.
While President Obama has not done things perfectly, he has injected some fairness and balance into the economy to spur growth and job creation.
It is personal.
Are Republicans really advocating that the greed of Wall Street be put before the needs of the American people?
They do.
Critics scream "class warfare," and decry the attacks on the "job creators," and cry "socialism" as they continue to preserve this unjust system that is giving rise to what could be a powerful and sustained movement.
Who are they?
It is in fact the American way.
Not economic, not political, but personal.
