(CNN) -- A recent CNN.com op-ed asked "Was the Shell Oil hoax ethical?"
In the Arctic, the oil giant is exploiting melting sea ice to drill for more of the oil causing global warming in the first place.
An oil spill response barge, the Arctic Challenger, which Shell promised the U.S. Coast Guard was "Arctic ready," is in Washington state, beset with technical problems.
To get the truth out, we wanted to make a website that imagined a world in which Shell was a little less guarded about the implications of drilling for oil in Alaska.
And when people realize it's a parody, they like it even more.
But Shell and its sympathizers would like people to talk about Greenpeace and the Yes Men rather than what the company is doing in the Arctic.
We're Greenpeace and the Yes Men, and we're ready to sit down with Shell any time to debate the ethics of Arctic drilling.
