"I think that white people shower a lot more than ethnic," said Rivera, who was a guest host on the Tuesday edition of "The View."
"I feel like showering more than once a day or every day is such a white people thing."
But... you're someone's mother..." said Rivera, posting on Instagram.
Even though she's newly married (to a man), we're happy she understands the compliment.
It's all female best friends for Rivera and all male best friends for her new husband, Rivera told members of the "The View" in November.
"So I don't believe in it."
