Nonetheless, the 20-year-old from the St. Louis area has been arrested for the shootings of two police officers during last week's protests in Ferguson, Missouri, a prosecutor said Sunday.
The prosecutor thanked the public for the information that led to the arrest.
The shots rang out from a hill overlooking the city's police station shortly after midnight Wednesday, at the end of a protest against the Ferguson Police Department, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at the time.
McCulloch said the tipster whose information led to Williams' arrest is eligible to receive the reward.
"These police officers were standing there, and they were shot just because they were police officers," he said.
While many protesters have decried the Ferguson Police Department, neither of the officers shot last week were from the city.
Both men have been treated and released.
