Sony cut $50 from each, which is nearly the price of a new game.
Microsoft has not reduced the Xbox 360's price since 2009, and analysts are split on whether it will do so this year as a response to Sony.
Last month, Nintendo cut the price of the 3DS, its handheld game console that displays 3-D graphics without needing special glasses.
The version with 3G will cost $300, and the one without will cost $250.
