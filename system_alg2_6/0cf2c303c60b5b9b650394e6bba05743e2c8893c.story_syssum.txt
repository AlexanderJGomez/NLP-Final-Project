An injured Morgan McCracken has benefited from awareness after Natasha Richardson's death.
But after hearing about Richardson's death, the McCrackens wondered if Morgan was really as OK as she seemed.
The McCrackens took Morgan to the emergency room at LakeWest Hospital in neighboring Willoughby, where doctors ordered a CT scan and immediately put Morgan on a helicopter to Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, with her father by her side.
"Dr. Cohen told us that if we hadn't brought her in Thursday night, she never would have woken up," McCracken says.
In most cases, it's pretty clear when someone needs medical attention after a head injury, says Greg Ayotte, a spokesperson for the Brain Injury Association of America and a cognitive rehabilitation therapist.
But then there's what doctors call the "talk and die" scenario, where someone seems fine, only to die hours, or sometimes even days later.

The McCrackens say they look back and still can't believe Morgan suffered such a severe injury and didn't show any signs for 48 hours.
