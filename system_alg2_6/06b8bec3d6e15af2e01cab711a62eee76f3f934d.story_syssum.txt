The $165 million animated film topped the chart with $49.1 million out of 3,752 theaters — the strongest debut ever for a Walt Disney Animation production (i.e., not including Pixar titles).
The Robert Zemeckis-directed drama "Flight" soared in second place with $25 million from just 1,884 theaters, giving the $31 million Paramount film the strongest per theater average in the Top 20, with $13,275.
That lifts its total to $75.9 million.
That last Ben Affleck vehicle to gross $100 million was 2003′s "Daredevil," which earned $102.5 million.
