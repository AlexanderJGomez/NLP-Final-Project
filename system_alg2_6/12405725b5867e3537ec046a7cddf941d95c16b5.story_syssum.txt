Launching a counterattack on Japan seemed impossible, because there were no U.S. airfields close enough.

Friends and admirers of the Raiders have been trying to persuade Congress, in recognition of the Raiders' contribution to this country, to award the entire 80-man squad not the Medal of Honor, but the Congressional Gold Medal, one of our nation's highest tributes.
You'd think the Doolittle Raiders would rate one.

The Doolittle Raiders have earned that medal.
