Moyes, who has been in charge at Goodison Park since 2002, will take charge of the club's final two Premier League games of the season before making the move to Old Trafford.
"I have had a terrific job at Everton, with a tremendous chairman and Board of Directors and a great set of players.
"He was a young man then at the start of his career and has since gone on to do a magnificent job at Everton.
"Everton can confirm that David Moyes will leave the Club at the end of the season," the Merseyside club said in a statement.
Moyes took charge of Everton on over 500 occasions with the club qualifying for Europe four times during his time as manager.
Moyes may need to find a replacement for Wayne Rooney, who has told the club he wants to leave according to British reports Thursday -- but United said he is not for sale.
Rooney handed in a transfer request in late 2010, but was persuaded to stay by Ferguson and rewarded with a lucrative new contract that still has two years to run.
