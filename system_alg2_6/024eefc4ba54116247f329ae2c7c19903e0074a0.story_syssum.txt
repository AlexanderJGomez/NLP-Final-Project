"I am not a big fan of football so I didn't really know much about Andriy but it was great to play with him.
"I just found this great game where you have to be focused and balanced and that's why I like it.
"It's the first event for me and also in Ukraine so it's big for golf here," he said.
"I love golf and I'm so happy that golf is starting to pick up in Ukraine and the people are starting to invest money long term."
