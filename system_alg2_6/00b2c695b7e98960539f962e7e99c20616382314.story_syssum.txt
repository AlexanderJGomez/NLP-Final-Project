Hosted by Yasser Sami and Walid Monam, and produced by their friend Ghazwan Al-Shawi, the show is called "Akou Fad Wahad" -- "There is this guy" -- the typical setup for one of their anecdotes.
Sami said a gang even turned up at his house, threatening him.
"We changed things in the show," he said.
Even in the new Iraq, said Monam, there are still many "red lines" that cannot be crossed in entertainment.
