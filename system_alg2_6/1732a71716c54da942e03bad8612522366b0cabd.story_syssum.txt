The wife of British hostage Alan Henning pleaded Saturday with ISIS to release him, describing her husband as a "peaceful, selfless man" who was only in Syria to help people in need.
"Alan is a peaceful, selfless man who left his family and his job as a taxi driver in the UK to drive in a convoy all the way to Syria with his Muslim colleagues and friends to help those most in need," she said in the statement.
And news of Haines' death came the same day that his family released a brief message to his captors through the UK Foreign Office.
"When they hear this message, I implore the people of the Islamic State to see it in their hearts to release my husband, Alan Henning."
While part of the convoy stopped at the Turkish border, Henning -- the only non-Muslim in the group -- volunteered to cross into Syria with a 10-person advance party.
The other members of the convoy thought "that they would just question him further and then they would let him go," she said.
CAGE, a Muslim-led human rights advocacy group in London, also called for Henning's immediate release, saying he wasn't involved in any hostilities toward Muslims.
None of his workmates at the taxi company nor any of the neighbors on his street were willing to talk to the news media.
