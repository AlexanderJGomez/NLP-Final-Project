Mandela was branded a communist by the white apartheid government, which made it a crime to be one.
Then the government banned the communist party and the African National Congress, which fought for the freedom of black South Africans.
Not really, believes South African historian Sampie Terreblanche.
"The ANC is not a communist Party," he said.
At the time that Umkhonto we Sizwe carried out its first attacks, Mandela was at its helm.
He may not have been directly behind the attacks, said Hermann Giliomee, a historian from South Africa.
Umkhonto we Sizwe beat the war drum against the "white supremacy" and "the white state."
"Umkhonto we Sizwe is a new, independent body, formed by Africans, It includes in its ranks South Africans of all races," the group said in its manifesto.
At a sports match in 1995, as President, Mandela made a gesture of support to white South Africans that drew gasps.
The crowd began chanting his name.
