Allegations against the Japanese camera and medical equipment maker came to light after the October dismissal of former President Michael Woodford -- a rare foreign chief executive in corporate Japan -- after he questioned ex-board members about dubious transactions at the center of the case.
The new management includes Yasuyuki Kimoto, a former director of Sumitomo Mitsui Bank, who becomes chairman, while Hiroyuki Sasa, an Olympus executive officer, is promoted to president.
Olympus is the world's largest maker of endoscopes, and Sasa is currently director of Olympus Medical Services.
Meeting with the press yesterday in Tokyo, Woodford said he wanted to shine light on corporate governance in Japan.
Olympus shares lost nearly 80% of its market value in the weeks after Woodford went public with his allegations.
