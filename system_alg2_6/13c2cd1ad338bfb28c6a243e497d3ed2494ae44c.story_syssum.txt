John Brennan, the assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, said on CNN's "State of the Union" that the security breakdown in the failed bombing of the Northwest Airlines flight was different from the September 11, 2001, terror attacks.
Brennan said the father's information was part of "bits and pieces" of information that were never connected by intelligence officials to properly target the suspect.
"A number of pieces were out there that weren't brought together," Brennan said.
As a result, any individual flying into the United States who is "traveling from or through nations that are state sponsors of terrorism or other countries of interest will be required to go through enhanced screening," the statement said.
