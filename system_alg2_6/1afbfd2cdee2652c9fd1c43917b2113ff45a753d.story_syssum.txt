Republicans and Democrats have urgently pressed President Barack Obama to do something to stem the flow of child immigrants crossing the southern border -- and fast.
Obama on Wednesday called the flow of "unaccompanied children" an "incredibly dangerous" situation, and said his proposal offers Congress "the capacity to vote immediately" on a solution if it wants to address the problem swiftly.
"No amount of resources or changes will be effective in stemming the surge of illegal border crossings if President Obama continues to ignore the law," he wrote in a statement, resurrecting the common refrain when immigration reform was still a possibility.
While Democrats indicate they support Obama's request, they want more details before signing off.
"We just can't just trust the President and say we are going to give you exactly every penny you want," Rep. Henry Cuellar, whose South Texas district is one heavily impacted by the current crisis, told CNN.
While the White House says it will ask Congress to give the Homeland Security Department more discretion to send such immigrants home, it's unclear if Obama will request changes to the anti-trafficking law.
I trust this president but I want to verify," Durbin said.
