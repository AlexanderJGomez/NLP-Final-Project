From making his professional debut at just 13 to running top-class defenders ragged, this is one Tiger who hasn't changed his stripes since bursting onto the scene in Europe with Porto and Atletico Madrid.
His stunning hat-trick in the demolition of European champions Chelsea at the 2012 Super Cup Final underlined to those not au fait with Spanish football just how deadly he can be.
Falcao has emerged as one of the world's top goalscorers since making the move to Porto from Argentina's River Plate in July 2009.
His father played club football in Colombia, and there was never a doubt in Falcao's mind what he wanted to achieve in life.
It was the realization of a dream for a player which had begun life with one simple dream -- to become one of the best striker's on the planet.
"We're forming quite a strong team and hopefully we can manage to qualify for the World Cup and for the next few World Cups and bring lots of other triumphs and victories home," he said.
