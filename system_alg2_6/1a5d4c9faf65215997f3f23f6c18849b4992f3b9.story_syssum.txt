Cairo (CNN) -- The man who held Egypt in an autocratic grip for three decades is apparently soon going free.
The court ordered Mubarak's release because he has been held past the maximum time he can be detained before being convicted.
Egypt's general prosecutor has said he will not appeal to keep Mubarak in custody, state media reported, clearing the way for him to be released.
Mubarak ruled Egypt, the most populous Arab country, for three decades until demonstrators opposing his rule forced his ouster in 2011 as part of the Arab Spring revolutions across Africa and the Middle East.
According to Trager, many Egyptians now believe -- thanks to a persistent state media campaign since Morsy was ousted -- that the Muslim Brotherhood was responsible for the deaths of protesters during the 2011 uprising, not the Mubarak regime.
"Others, who see this as a normal, understandable process in which a leader who they now associate with a better time in Egypt is now being released, will give a different response," he said.
