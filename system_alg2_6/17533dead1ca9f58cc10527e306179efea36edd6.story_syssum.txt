The Texas lawsuit asks for money from BP and other parties for a host of reasons.
The lawsuit also asks for civil penalties for every barrel as well as every day that oil was discharged into the Gulf.
A month later, a federal judge signed off on BP's settlement with businesses and people hard hit by the spill.
Texas, for one, doesn't specify in its lawsuit how much money it is seeking.
