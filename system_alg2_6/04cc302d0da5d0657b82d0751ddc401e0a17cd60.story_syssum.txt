(CNN) -- Sitting in the first lady's box listening to the President Barack Obama push for movement on immigration reform, Cristian Avila no longer had to keep his head down and live in fear of being deported.
DACA is a government program enacted in 2012 that stopped deporting some undocumented young people and instead granted them temporary work authorization and a two-year reprieve from deportation.

So let's get immigration reform done this year," he said.
Still, Avila remains optimistic that immigration reform will happen in 2014.
It shouldn't take any longer," Avila said.
