An inaugural grand prix in New Jersey has now been included in the record-breaking 22 race calendar issued by motorsport's global governing body, the FIA, Friday.
A provisional race in 2014 has been given a date of 16 November.
The New Jersey race has already been postponed once, having been initially scheduled for June this year.
Austria also makes a return to the calendar in June -- a race that has not been given provisional status.
But Pirelli have since introduced a new tire structure for the second half of the season and the FIA has agreed the company will continue to showcase its rubber in motorsport's elite racing series.
