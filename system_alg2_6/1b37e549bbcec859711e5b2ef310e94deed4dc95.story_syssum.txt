Even the terms used to name them -- Hispanics, Hispanic-Americans, Latinos, Latino-Americans, the Spanish-surnamed -- too tightly package the people categorized by those definitions, some observers say.
From a census standpoint, being of Hispanic or Latino origin means a person identifies himself in one of four listed categories: Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban or "other Spanish, Hispanic or Latino" origin.
"That's the way you call our people," Susana Clar, 52, said of the terms.
He never uses Hispanic to identify himself because "I am mixed," Baez said.
"For me...there is no such thing as a Latino identity," said Suzanne Oboler, professor of Puerto Rican and Latino studies at John Jay College at the City University of New York.
Others, such as Carl J. Kravetz, a longtime veteran of Hispanic marketing, said similarities among the different subsets of Latinos do show a Latino identity, one partly fused through the group's experience in the United States.
So much so, he said, that he and others coined the term "new generation Latinos" to refer to them.
And I don't say, 'I'm Hispanic or Latino, or I'm from Mexico,' because I'm not."
