Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The U.S. Defense Department on Monday identified the SEAL killed during a successful raid to free a captive doctor in Afghanistan.
Armed men kidnapped Joseph and two other staff members for the international aid group Morning Star on Wednesday as they returned from a rural medical clinic in eastern Kabul province.
The Afghan doctor's family paid $12,000 to the smugglers, Haqbeen and Samad said.
Former classmate Stefanie Stewart told CNN she sat next to Checque on the school bus almost every day.
Morning Star did not release the identities of the other two men, citing safety concerns.
Despite the kidnappings of Joseph and its two other staffers, Morning Star reiterated its "commitment to continue its work" in Afghanistan.
