(CNN) -- A widespread outbreak of severe weather across the Deep South may be one for the record books, as the National Weather Service received reports of more than 150 tornadoes.
An official count is not immediately available, but Jeras said she expects that the numbers will reveal a historic April with a record number of twisters.
A tornado can form when a mesocyclone -- a rotating column of air -- is created within a super cell storm and is stretched to create a funnel-like structure that can reach speeds of up to several hundred miles per hour.
With the latest outbreak, April may turn out to be a historic month for tornadoes, he said.
"We may finish out April with more than 300 tornadoes," Carbin said.
