As the Opening Ceremony was under way, Georgia's president said that his country was under attack by Russian tanks and warplanes.
Earlier Friday, the anticipation over the Beijing Olympics was unmistakable in China's capital city.
Political leaders do not attend Olympic opening ceremonies as a matter of protocol -- Bush is the first American president to attend them outside the United States -- but China seemed determined to have as many there as possible.
The first medals will be awarded Saturday, and China hoped to claim the first gold of the Games.
