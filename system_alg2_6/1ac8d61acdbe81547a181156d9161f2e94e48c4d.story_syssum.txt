Former Rep. Joe Kennedy may try to launch a political comeback amid all the Kennedy nostalgia.
Massachusetts law requires a special election for Kennedy's seat to be held within 160 days.
Just last week, Kennedy urged that the law be changed to allow the governor to appoint a temporary replacement until the special election could be held.
Why?
Rep. Mike Capuano, now in his sixth term from Somerville, currently has the seat once held by President Kennedy and House Speaker Tip O'Neill.
Massachusetts Democrats might, however, decide it's time to turn the political page by sending a woman to the U.S. Senate.
Former Rep. Joe Kennedy, who held Capuano's seat from 1987 to 1999, may also try to launch a political comeback on the strength of the current wave of emotion and nostalgia.
