Why aren't air traffic controllers using it to constantly track all commercial airliners?
Why don't all airliners stream their so-called black box data to satellites in real time?
To understand why, you first have to know a little about the technology and the gaps in the system.
Aircraft flying more than about 200 miles from land over oceans are not tracked by air traffic control radar screens.
In these cases, air traffic controllers see only a blip on radar screens.
â€¢ But  primary radar operated by the military in Malaysia and Thailand is able to track the 777 for limited periods without its transponder being on.
We might know more about what happened to MH370 if air traffic controllers used orbiting satellites to track airliners, instead of radar.
An aircraft outfitted with this system determines its location using GPS and transmits that data back to controllers by radio -- which has a greater range than radar.
Another emerging technology that might have helped us know more about what happened is called AFIRS, the Automated Flight Information Reporting System, developed by a Canadian company called FLYHT.
And this week, Australia's air traffic control manager, Airservices Australia, announced a test partnership with Malaysia and Indonesia to track long-haul flights over remote ocean routes.
Although technology continues to shrink the planet in terms of communication, the tragedy offers a bitter reminder of how easy it still is to lose an entire airliner full of people.
