Three years ago Sunday Arrianna watched her mother Kim Dahl drive a school bus loaded with children across the Mississippi River when the bridge began to buckle up and down.
The bus "went up, and then it went down," Dahl recalls, adding it soon turned into free fall and she was "hanging on for dear life."
Since that day, those on the bridge and their loved ones have never been the same.
"It's like a new me that I'm living with," Dahl said.
"My kids and my husband -- I couldn't ask for a better family," Dahl said.
"Most of the time when my mom is in the hospital or getting surgeries, I have to step in and be the surrogate mother to my younger siblings," Arrianna explains.
Kim Dahl is among 122 victims and their families who've filed suit against URS Corp., an engineering and construction firm hired by Minnesota DOT to conduct engineering analysis on the bridge before it collapsed.
On Tuesday Kim Dahl and Arrianna visited the site of the collapse -- where the new I-35 West bridge stands.
"She is kind of like my counselor because she listens," Arrianna said.
Kim Dahl says she'll never be able to drive a bus again -- something she misses more than anything.
"My mom could never afford it...we never went anywhere," Kim Dahl recalls of her childhood.
Given the path Kim Dahl and her loved ones have traveled since 2007, that phrase could be the family motto too.
