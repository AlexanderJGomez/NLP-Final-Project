Regardless of whether Plotnitsky's offer was sincere, it reflected a serious reality: A war that has spread misery in eastern Ukraine and heightened tensions between Russia and the West is still going on, despite a supposed ceasefire that the two sides signed two months ago.
And Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said Wednesday that Kiev would not negotiate directly with the rebels, arguing that a ceasefire deal already had been made and all that anyone needed to do was follow it.
A day earlier, Breedlove said Russia had moved "forces that are capable of being nuclear" into Crimea, which was Ukrainian territory until being folded into Russia on the heels of a government turnover earlier this year.
Unrest in Ukraine began with protests in the country's capital last year after pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych, favoring closer ties to Russia, dropped plans to sign a political and economic agreement with the European Union.
