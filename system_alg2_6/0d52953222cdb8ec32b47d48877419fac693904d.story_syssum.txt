That said, Obama remains far more popular personally than Bush, whose Iraq war adventure with the eager assistance of British Prime Minister Tony Blair led to splits among Europe's leaders.
After the strong influence the climate change deniers appeared to have with the previous administration, Europeans were especially pleased that Obama said he would come to the climate summit in Copenhagen, Denmark.
On Afghanistan, Europe's political leaders were muttering behind the scenes as the president took a long time making up his mind about the extra troops.
He wanted to tell the folks back home in Peoria, Illinois, that the troops would be home in 18 months, and he wanted to tell the Taliban that an extra 30,000 troops were on their way to make life tough for them.
But they can see that power is moving inexorably from the the G8 to the G20, where Europe's influence will be diluted by major new players like China and India.
