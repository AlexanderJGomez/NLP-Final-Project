(CNN) -- Wildlife officials in Colorado say they have killed a bear believed to have been involved in an attack on a teenage boy Friday morning.
The bear was then chased away by the teen and other campers at the site.
He is expected to recover but will receive followup treatment.
Earlier this month, a man was killed in a grizzly bear attack in Wyoming's Yellowstone Park.
