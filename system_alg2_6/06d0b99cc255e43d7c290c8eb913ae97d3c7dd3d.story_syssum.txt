The wealthiest justice may be David Souter, with a wise investment he made years ago in a Vermont bank paying off handsomely.
Justice Samuel Alito, the newest member of the high court, also reported income ranging from $700,000 to $2 million.
Scalia also received an advance for his book on how to be a better appellate lawyer.
But the Most Traveled Award goes to Scalia, who made 33 expense-paid trips, including eight overseas, and visited at least 17 states.
Chief Justice John Roberts may have the most diverse investment portfolio.
When he took over as chief justice in 2005, he was forced to sell stock in several companies.
No reason was given for their recusal, but financial disclosure reports showed that Roberts, along with Breyer and Alito, owns stock in several of the companies being sued.
Federal law allows judges to own mutual funds without having to recuse themselves from a particular appeal.
