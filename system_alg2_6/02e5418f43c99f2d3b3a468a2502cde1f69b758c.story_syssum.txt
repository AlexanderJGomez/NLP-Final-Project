Captured in waters off Washington State in 1970, Lolita is an orca -- a killer whale.
It's a crime," Kaamil said.
Like a second lump of sugar, a whale named Hugo who had been captured from the same free-living whale community two years earlier, shared Lolita's teacup for 10 years.
Free-living orcas never do anything self-destructive.
"The captures of young whales in the 1960s and '70s really caused a long-term problem," Balcomb told me.
Before the captures they totaled about 120 whales.
The whole U.S. resident population now has just two-dozen females of reproductive age.
There, she can be in vocal contact with her family.
