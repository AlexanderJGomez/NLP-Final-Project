At a protest earlier this week, one police officer died and scores of people were injured, according to police.
The unrest came as demonstrators hoped to force Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra from office.
The national Election Commission urged the government to postpone elections.
Protest leaders have said they want to rid Thailand of the influence of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the older brother of Yingluck Shinawatra.
If he returns, he risks a two-year prison sentence on a corruption conviction, which he says was politically motivated.
