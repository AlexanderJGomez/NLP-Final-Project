"It is one of the greatest voyages of mankind and if anyone could have done it [before Columbus], it was the Phoenicians," said Beale.
Beale sailed the replica boat -- aptly named The Phoenician -- around Africa in 2010, in a bid to demonstrate the ancient civilization had the capability to circumnavigate the continent 2,000 years before the first recorded European; Bartolomeu Dias, in 1488.
Using locally-sourced materials, shipbuilders stayed true to the original down to the exact thickness of the planks and position of the mast.
It was here Beale got his inspiration for the journey to the U.S.
He said copper coins with Phoenician iconography have also also been discovered in North America.
"The conventional wisdom is that Christopher Columbus discovered America.
I put forward the theory that the Phoenicians could have been first and I hope to prove that was the case."
