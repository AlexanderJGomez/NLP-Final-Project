San Diego (CNN) -- Some elections are fueled by passion.
GOP officials would like to convince Americans that they have an embarrassment of riches on their hands, but many of us can see that they're only half right.
As recently noted by The Wall Street Journal, a recent Gallup poll of Republicans put support for Romney at 24%, and last month, his level of support floated between 22% and 25%.
Just 37% of those surveyed -- Republicans, Democrats and independents --- are certain they want to give Obama another term.
To be re-elected, Obama needs to recapture the support of two groups of voters: young people and Latinos.
According to a new Ipsos-Telemundo poll, the president's support among Latinos continues to plummet.
