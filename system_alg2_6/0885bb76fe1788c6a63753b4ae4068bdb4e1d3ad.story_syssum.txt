Medics in Change Square said at least four people were killed and another 26 injured after government forces raided parts of the capital.
Another eight people died and 20 were injured in government raids on civilian property, said Abdulqawi al-Qaisi, a prominent opposition leader and head of the Sadeq Ahmar media office.
"The international community must stop Saleh from killing his own people," al-Qaisi said Monday.
Opposition activists said the slain woman was 20 and said she was the first female to be killed while marching against the government.
We call on people to donate blood for the injured," said Mohammed Al-Qubati, who works at a field hospital in Change Square.
Others carried flowers or signs that said: "We are not armed, Don't attack us with gunfire," witnesses said Sunday.
For its part, the government said it is trying to come up with a solution to end the political stalemate.
