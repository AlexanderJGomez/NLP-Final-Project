While President Obama has reignited a national conversation over rising college costs with his new proposals, those suggestions are unlikely to dramatically lower costs soon.
A less cost-saving variant of the three-year plan would keep the degree at its traditional 120 semester hour length, but have students go to school year-round for three years.
Second, make it possible for students to use MOOCs (massively open online courses) and other low-cost, online options, allowing for lower cost "blended" degrees combining perhaps two years of traditional classroom experience with an equal amount of online training.
This would cut the cost of quality degrees perhaps 40%.
Third, offer a traditional residential degree for 40% less by dramatically reducing labor and capital costs.
Specifically, ask the faculty to teach four classes per semester instead of two or three.
Fourth, create a National College Equivalence Test similar to the high school GED.
Fifth, get the federal government out of the student financial aid business.
In short, there are lots of thing we can do to make colleges more affordable beyond the president's idea of providing good consumer information by rating colleges.
