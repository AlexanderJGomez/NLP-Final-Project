(CNN) -- Since the July 3 military coup, Egypt has been witness to the rise of a new military dictatorship led by Field Marshal Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
With regional support mainly from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who fervently seek to abort the Arab Spring, el-Sisi believes that he can suppress and tame the mounting anger and frustration among young Egyptians particularly Islamists who protest almost daily.
The U.S. policymakers believe that Egypt's military is the only force capable of retaining stability and maintaining security.
And despite the ruthless security campaign there, militant Islamists still pose a serious threat to Egypt's national security.
El-Sisi, Egypt's most likely post-coup president, will not be able to bring stability or security to the country.
Surely, el-Sisi's Gulf backers will likely continue their "lifeline" of support, at least for a while.
