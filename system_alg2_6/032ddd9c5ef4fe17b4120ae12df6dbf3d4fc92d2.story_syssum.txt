Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. government can use lethal force against an American citizen overseas if the person is a senior operational leader of al Qaeda or one of its affiliates, according to a Justice Department memo.
Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee are expected to grill him on the policy at his hearing on Thursday.
But the document also said the government is not required "to have clear evidence" that an attack against the United States will occur in the immediate future to determine that an imminent threat is posed by a U.S. citizen.
But that under generations-old legal principles, and Supreme Court decisions, U.S. citizenship alone does not make a leader of an enemy force immune from being targeted," White House spokesman Jay Carney said on Tuesday, recalling a speech last year by Attorney General Eric Holder.
Dianne Feinstein of California said in a statement that the Justice Department memo and other information has permitted the Intelligence Committee to conduct "appropriate and probing" oversight into the use of lethal force.
