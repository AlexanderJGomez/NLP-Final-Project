(The Frisky) -- Dan had a big grin in his profile picture, like he'd just said something super funny.
!
It was.
he asked me, twice.
"So, how often do you run?"
"I hate it when they do that," Dan said.
Dan asked.
I sighed and mentally scribed the "thanks, but no thanks" message I'd write to him tomorrow.
I have no idea if you'd like to see me again, but a part of me would strongly like to ask you to do so.
But--
So.
Dear Dan, There are so many things I'd like to tell you.
Yeah, thanks for sending me that message.
P.S.
Dan doesn't deserve my heated words, or the three minutes of my life it'd take to write them.
