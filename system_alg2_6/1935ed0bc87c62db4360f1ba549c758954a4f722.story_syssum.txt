"Yes the people who fly our planes are demanding, and they have a right to be," says Faisal Ghazi Kayal, managing director of Saudia Private Aviation.
For Kayal's clients who wish to be treated like kings, Royal Jet, the UAE-based charter company, actually caters for members of the Emirate's royal family.
Together Saudi Arabia and the UAE account for around 70% of the private jet market in the Middle East and North Africa, according to Middle East Business Aviation Association, but there are some clouds on the horizon for the charter companies.
This is one of the reasons companies like Royal Jet and Saudia Private Aviation are keen to highlight the safety and security of their planes and the experience of their pilots, as well as the level of service.
