"It is a sacred thing to create a face," says Wallace Chan, 58, the Chinese artisan jeweler that produced the piece.
It's not the first time that Chan has "created" a human face in a jewel.
"When you work from the back of the jewel, right is left, top is bottom and deep becomes shallow.
I make one cut, take it out of the water to check it, dry the stone, check it again, and if it's fine I put it back in the water and make another cut."
"My mind is one with the work, and my physical self is removed from the gemstone," he explains.
In the Eighties he began to practice, using cheap crystals.
The rest is history.
Two years ago, a small pair of Chan earrings sold in Hong Kong for $555,000.
"Each piece can take me thousands of hours," he says.
