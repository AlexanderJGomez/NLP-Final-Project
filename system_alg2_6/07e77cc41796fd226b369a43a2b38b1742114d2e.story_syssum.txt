Sheldon Stephens, now 24, is the fourth man to sue Kevin Clash, but he was the first one to publicly claim he had a sexual relationship with him as a teen.
Three other men soon emerged with federal lawsuits, filed last November and December, accusing Clash of befriending them as teenager then engaging in sex with them.
"Clash smoked crystal meth while engaging in sexual activity with Sheldon," the lawsuit said.
Clash resigned from his job on "Sesame Street" after the first lawsuit was filed in November.
Personal matters have diverted attention away from the important work Sesame Street is doing and I cannot allow it to go on any longer.
