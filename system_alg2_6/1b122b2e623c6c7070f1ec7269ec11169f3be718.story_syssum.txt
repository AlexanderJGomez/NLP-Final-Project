(CNN) -- Environmental activist Erin Brockovich was in Kingston, Tennessee, on Thursday to speak with residents affected by a massive spill of coal sludge from a nearby coal-fired plant.
She said she will tour the site on the ground and from the air.
Brockovich said residents have sent her photos showing fly ash up to 2 feet deep in places.
TVA, the nation's largest public utility, promised to do whatever it takes to clean the spill in central Tennessee.
