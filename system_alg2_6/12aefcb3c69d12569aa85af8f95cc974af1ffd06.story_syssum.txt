At that time, the police issued statements indicating his niece, Jean Marie Berlinghoff, was with him and "is believed to be endangered."
Charles Berlinghoff had been in and out of his extended family's life, even losing regular contact for a full decade, his brother told HLN.
Police said that an additional arrest warrant, details of which were not released, was obtained December 6 by Shasta County detectives.
Their run ended when one of Jean Marie's cousins, who lives in San Francisco, spotted the pair Saturday while shopping for a jacket, said Jake Berlinghoff.
