The election of 2004 was seen as a referendum on the Iraq war.
Aznar's replacement, Jose Luis Zapatero, ended the Spanish commitment to Iraq and sundered the close relationship with the United States.

Spain had signed up for the euro currency back in the 1990s.
The German economy is much more productive than the Spanish economy.
If the price of German goods and services declined inside Spain, then logically the price of Spanish goods and services (including vacations) must have risen to Germans.
By 2008, construction accounted for a staggering 16% of the Spanish economy.
As debtors scramble to service their debts, they cut back their buying of goods and services.
It will take a grand rethink of the whole euro currency project, a rethink that either emancipates Spain to quit the euro and export enough to repay its debts or else reduces the debt enough that Spain can sustain its expensive new currency.
