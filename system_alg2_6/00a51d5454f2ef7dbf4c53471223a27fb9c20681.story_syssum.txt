(CNN)Marco Rubio is all in.
Instead, Rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration.
Meanwhile, both the Deferred Action program and President Obama's executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favored by Hispanics.
Immigration and Cuba policy aside, Rubio's political philosophy will be a tough sell to Hispanics.
And though Rubio doubts that climate change is caused by humans, The New York Times has noted that Latinos view global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue.
By comparison, Rubio seems cautious and ill-suited to the task of rousing Republican voters.
Unfortunately, a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combination -- not for Rubio, and not for Latino voters.
