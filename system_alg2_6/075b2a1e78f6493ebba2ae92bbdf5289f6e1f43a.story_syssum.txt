Harold Henthorn, 58, appeared before a federal judge in Denver on Thursday to face a first-degree murder charge in the death of Toni Henthorn, who died after falling off a cliff in Rocky Mountain National Park in September 2012.
The couple also had a daughter, who is now 9, said Toni Henthorn's brother Todd Bertolet.
Authorities are now re-investigating the 1995 death of Harold Henthorn's first wife, Sandra Lynn Henthorn.
Bertolet said it wasn't until after his sister's death that his family learned the details surrounding the death of Harold Henthorn's first wife.
His sister was living in Mississippi when she met Henthorn on the Internet, and he was in Colorado, Bertolet said.
Bertolet said Harold Henthorn controlled the couple's finances.
