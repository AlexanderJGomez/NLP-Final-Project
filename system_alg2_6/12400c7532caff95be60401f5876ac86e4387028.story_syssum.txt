(CNN)My son Jason Rezaian and his wife were taken at gunpoint from their apartment in Iran more than 200 days ago.
Yeganeh was released in early October, and through November she was permitted three phone calls and two visits each week.
When I visited my son in Evin on Christmas Day, he told me: "I will be a model prisoner if I am granted my rights under Islamic law.
In fact, in the early months, I was told the Iranians were asking Jason, "Where is your mother?"
Anyone with knowledge of Iran knows that nothing happens during the two weeks following Nowruz, a period when even newspapers don't publish, so it can only be assumed his trial date might not be set before April 6.
It is traditionally a time when pardons are granted and prisoners are released on bail to visit with their families.
But our patience ran out some time ago, and it is difficult, nearly impossible, to maintain respect for a system under which someone who was born and raised American is being detained "as an Iranian" even as his rights under Iran's own laws are being so flagrantly violated.
