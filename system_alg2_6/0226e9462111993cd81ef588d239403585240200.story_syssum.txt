For those of us caring for people with AIDS, it was a dark time.
Much has been accomplished in the fight against HIV/AIDS from scientific, medical and public health standpoints.
Globally, 33 million people are living with HIV infection, most of them in the developing world.
In low- and middle-income countries, less than one-third of people in need of anti-HIV therapy are receiving it, and only one in five people at risk of HIV infection have access to prevention services.
Here in the United States, more than one-fifth of people living with HIV are unaware of their infection and not receiving appropriate care for their own health or the prevention services that would help them avoid transmitting the virus to others.
Multiple clinical studies of PrEP are under way in the United States and in populations around the world.
Historically, it has taken decades to find effective vaccines to combat most infectious diseases.
