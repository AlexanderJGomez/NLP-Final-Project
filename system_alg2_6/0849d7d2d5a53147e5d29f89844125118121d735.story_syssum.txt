(CNN) -- The new Roman Catholic archbishop of Seattle, J. Peter Sartain, was installed Wednesday afternoon with a Mass in the archdiocese's cathedral, amid ongoing controversy over Sartain's ordination of a priest who later pleaded guilty in a molestation case.
Who would take that chance?"
The Archdiocese of Seattle has said that once Sartain found out about the allegations, he reported them.
For many years to come, we will love our Lord," Sartain told attendees.
