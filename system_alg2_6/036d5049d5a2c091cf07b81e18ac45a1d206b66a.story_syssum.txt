Former President Bill Clinton, who has been campaigning for President Obama and taking on the GOP, went off-script several times.
But at another level, the debate between these two men is part of a bigger debate about what kind of campaign the Democrats should run: a campaign of articulation or a campaign of triangulation.
The other kind of campaign, the campaign of "triangulation," is one that Bill Clinton mastered in 1996.
This was the kind of campaign Obama has always promised voters he would not run.
In 1996, Clinton perfected this kind of campaign.
Obama understands that the danger of a campaign of articulation is that he would not be able to capitalize on the issues that convince many moderates to go to or stick with the Republican Party.
Obama's best bet is to stick with a campaign in which he focuses on defining a Democratic set of principles and offering voters a reason why his party would be better over the next four years, especially on the economy.
