The Lumia 2520 tablet will cost $499 and run Windows RT 8.1, a limited variation of the Windows 8 operating system that uses that system's tile-based touchscreen feature.
The new big-screen 1520 smartphone will have a smaller but still powerful 20 megapixel camera and cost $749 before any carrier subsides.
The Nokia Camera app is getting an update across all Nokia devices.

Nokia also announced three new Asha devices on Tuesday.
Aimed at developing markets, they can also hold a charge for up to a month.
