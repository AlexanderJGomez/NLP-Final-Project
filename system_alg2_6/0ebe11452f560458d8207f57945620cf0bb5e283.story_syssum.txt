Filmmaker Michael Moore says the collapse of General Motors could mean the loss of millions of jobs.
Michael Moore: When I made that film, there were still 50,000 people working at General Motors in Flint.
When I made that movie that year, General Motors made a profit of over $4 billion, and they were still laying off people simply to make a bit more money, the people who helped to build the company, the workers in their hometown of Flint, Michigan, they just forgot about them and took the money and ran.
General Motors still wouldn't change.
I'll tell you, it was hilarious just watching these CEOs there (Tuesday) and (Wednesday) testifying in Congress, saying that, you know, that the problem wasn't theirs, you know, the cars they were building.
I'll tell you, you know, I'm of mixed mind about this bailout, Larry, because I don't think these companies, with these management people, should be given a dime, because  that's just going to be money going up in smoke or off to other countries.
When Roosevelt came in and when World War II faced the country, Roosevelt said to General Motors and Ford, you're not going to build cars anymore.
They're to build hybrid cars.
There's got to be a plan set out to find other ways to transport ourselves in other ways than using fossil fuels.
