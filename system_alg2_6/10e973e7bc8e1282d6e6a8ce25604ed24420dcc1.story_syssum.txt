Paul Montalbano's testimony in federal court on Tuesday came on the 11th day of proceedings to determine whether Hinckley can spend more time visiting his mother in Virginia and might eventually be released as a permanent outpatient.
Witnesses for the government say Hinckley is isolated and has made no friends during his trips to Virginia.
The hearing resumes on Wednesday and could conclude this week.
