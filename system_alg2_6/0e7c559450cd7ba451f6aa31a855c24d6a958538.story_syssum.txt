(Rolling Stone) -- Denver's stately Ellie Caulkins Opera House hosted the kickoff of Death Cab for Cutie's intimate theater tour last night, beginning a 22-date jaunt that finds the indie-pop band collaborating with San Francisco's Magik*Magik Orchestra.
"Words really can't describe the feeling that we get to share the stage with Low," Gibbard said as he launched into "Soul Meets Body," a crowd-pleaser.
"Jason looks like he stole that drum kit from Tito Puente," Gibbard quipped, in one of the night's few unscripted moments.
