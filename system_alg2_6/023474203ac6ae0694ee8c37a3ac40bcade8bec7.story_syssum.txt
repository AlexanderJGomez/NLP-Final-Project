(CNN) -- The Florida police sergeant fired for possessing shooting targets resembling Trayvon Martin defended himself Sunday and said the targets were meant to be used as training aids for "no-shoot" situations.
King, in a video statement posted online, said he bought the targets because the two items -- the Skittles and iced tea -- were not threatening, which meant the target could be used to help train officers when not to shoot a suspect.
He said he showed them to only one, a fellow sergeant, to find out whether he thought they could be useful training aids.
King said he offered one of the targets to the sergeant after the sergeant said his son would "get a kick" out of them.
