"What's that?"
O'Brien said he was an "independent" bookmaker, or unaffiliated with a crime organization, when Bulger summoned him to a meeting to discuss joining the Bulger group.
Bulger never personally took the money, which was always paid in cash.
He said before he left for the meeting he told his daughter, "If I'm not back in 12 hours go to the FBI in Miami.
Don't go to the FBI there."
Bulger's lawyers also are trying to establish that Bulger was never a paid informant for the FBI and that instead Bulger was the one paying rogue agents for information.
