(CNN) -- Veteran striker Miroslav Klose equaled the World Cup scoring record of Brazilian great Ronaldo to rescue a point for Germany in a pulsating 2-2 draw with Ghana in Fortaleza Saturday.
It was his fifth goal in World Cup finals, equaling the African record held by the great Roger Milla of Cameroon.
"It doesn't matter whether I play from the start or come off the bench: all games are important and 15 goals in 20 World Cup games isn't bad," said Klose, who plays for Italian club Lazio.
Boateng's half-brother Jerome was in the Germany side, only the second time in World Cup history this has occurred.
