(CNN) -- Hundred's of fans and former teammates of Robert Enke gathered to lay flowers and light candles outside of Hannover 96's Niedersachsen Stadion after the club's German goalkeeper was struck and killed by a train on Tuesday, in what police called an apparent suicide.
"We are in a state of shock," said team manager Oliver Bierhoff in a statement from the German Football Federation.
The German Football Federation (DFB) said Enke always said he wanted to play for the national team at the 2010 World Cup.
"People knew it was a terrible, terrible tragedy for him."
"But he kept it under wraps."
