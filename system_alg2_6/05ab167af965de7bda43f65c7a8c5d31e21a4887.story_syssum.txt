Spraying chemical dispersants on the slick, as BP has, is one way to remove oil from the surface.
This is therefore the first spill where large plumes of oil have been observed spreading below the sea surface.
To map underwater concentrations of oil and dispersants, instruments need to be lowered into the plumes to take measurements and samples that are later analyzed in a lab.
Near the source of the oil plumes in the gulf, the sampling problem is particularly severe because "young" plumes tend to be extremely patchy (the oil distribution is very uneven).
To determine the extent of the oil spill, we will need to combine measurements with computer modeling.
And monitoring the circulation should continue even after the oil leak has been stopped, until the oil has dispersed sufficiently so as not to pose any further biological risk.
