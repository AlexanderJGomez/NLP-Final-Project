Singer Maura O'Connell says one of Ted Kennedy's favorite songs, "A Family Tie," spoke to his love of family.
When we spoke the next day, he told me how much he enjoyed my singing and named particular songs that meant a great deal to him.
In many houses back then, there were pictures of the pope and John F. Kennedy.
We were all very proud of that, so when I got the call about singing at the wedding, the first person I told was my dad.
I sang some songs during the ceremony, and then a few afterwards.
He gave Vicki a painting of daffodils he had painted as a wedding gift.
I sang at various events the senator was involved in, most recently at a fundraiser for his re-election.
He spoke to the kids about his first time in Washington and how his brother John, a senator at the time, showed him around.
He loved to serve, but most of all he dearly loved his wife and family.
