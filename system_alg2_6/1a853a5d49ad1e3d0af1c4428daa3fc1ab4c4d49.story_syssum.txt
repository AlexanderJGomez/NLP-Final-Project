But while she battles for the gold, Johnson is fighting another battle: with Crohn's disease, one of the two most common inflammatory bowel diseases, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Crohn's disease is an autoimmune disease of the digestive tract that most often affects the small or large intestines, and sometimes both.
In Crohn's disease, all layers of the intestine may be involved and there can be normal healthy bowel between patches of diseased bowel."
"Crohn's is a chronic, lifelong disease for which there is no cure," he said.
However, they too have their own set of complications and side effects.
A diagnosis of Crohn's disease often brings more questions than answers, and patients can face a long list of ever-changing complications.
The two most common surgeries for Crohn's disease are bowel resection surgery, which involves removal of the deteriorated portion of intestine, and fistula repair surgery.
"It's not a matter of if we find cures; it's a matter of when, and that's determined by available funding," said Richard Geswell, president of the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America.
This allows the patient to develop an understanding of his or her individual case, and allows the foundation to have access to more patient histories for use in its research.
