At the same time, a new report about the Syrian civil war showed what appears to be convincing evidence of large-scale "systematic torture and killing" by the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Iran's top ally.
Under the deal negotiated in November, Iran suspended some of its nuclear enrichment operations, and Western governments started lifting some of the economic sanctions they have used to pressure Tehran.
It has become a proxy war for regional rivalries, with Sunni states, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, supporting the opposition, and Iran, along with Hezbollah, standing steadfastly with al-Assad by providing him with manpower, ammunition and intelligence.
The sight of top American and European diplomats rushing to Geneva to negotiate with Iran sent a strong message.
One reason Iran signed the interim deal is that it has already achieved a great deal of what it sought with its nuclear program.
European, Asian and Arab businessmen are lining up to make deals with a resurgent Iran.
Syria's regime will likely become more beholden to Iran than ever.
Otherwise, the region will become an even more dangerous and desperate place, as we see today in Syria.
