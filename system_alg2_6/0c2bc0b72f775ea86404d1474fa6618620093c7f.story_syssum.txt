Foreign ministry spokesman Abubakar Al-Sidiq said that he is not aware of any plans to release Mariam Yahya Ibrahim before a ruling from an appeals court.
"I'm not aware that any release is imminent," Wani told CNN.

A CNN request for an interview was denied, and the justice minister said they don't comment on such matters because a final judgment has not yet been issued.
His wife, he said, was raised a Christian by her mother, an Ethiopian Orthodox, after her Muslim father deserted the family when Ibrahim was 6.
In addition to the emotional turmoil resulting from the conviction, the couple also have to worry about their children, Wani said.
Wani said he's not been allowed to visit his detained family as much since the apostasy charge was added.
Wani said he was optimistic the appeal their lawyers have filed would lead to the court's ruling being overturned.
"The fact that a woman could be sentenced to death for her religious choice, and to flogging for being married to a man of an allegedly different religion, is abhorrent and should never be even considered," said Manar Idriss, Amnesty International's Sudan researcher.
The last time Sudan executed someone for apostasy was in 1985 when a man criticized Sharia law.
