(WIRED)  -- When Microsoft and Facebook announced that they were partnering to integrate Facebook and Bing for social network-powered search, it confirmed something I thought Monday: Windows Phone 7 is the real Facebook phone.
Every aspect of Windows Phone 7 is geared to social networks: phone, contacts, gaming, photos, even Office.
Microsoft tried to explicitly build a social networking phone featuring Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and MySpace with the Kin.
It's the exact strategy that Zuckerberg outlined in his interview with Michael Arrington, where he explained why Facebook wasn't building its own phone.
In order to do that, Zuckerberg explained, you need to find a company that was willing to incorporate social networking from the operating system up -- not just adding a layer on top of it was already doing, but making that the focus of the device and its services.
Windows Live, Office Live, Xbox Live are all social networks where users work, share files and talk about media together.
And search is one of just three buttons on every WP7 phone.
It's about incorporating a social layer into media on every device in your household, from your phone to your set-top box.
The only places where Microsoft and Facebook are "underdogs" are search and smartphones.
