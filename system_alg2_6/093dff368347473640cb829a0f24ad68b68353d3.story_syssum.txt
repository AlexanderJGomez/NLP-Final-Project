Boko Haram militants killed as many as 2,000 people, mostly civilians,in a massacre that started the weekend before the terror attack on Charlie Hedbo in downtown Paris.
And Americans can directly relate to attacks on freedom of speech, former U.S.
That symbolism, which drove millions into the streets of Paris, cities around France and around the world, was also quickly seized on by France's President Fran√ßois Hollande, who quickly called for national unity in an address that honed in on France's ardent belief in freedom.
By contrast, the attacks on freedom of speech resounded strongly not just in France, but around the world.
But the reaction to the attacks has given the National Front and Marine Le Pen a slap in the face like only Charlie Hebdo -- which regularly lampooned the party and its leader -- could.
Instead, the demonstrators in Paris proclaimed a national unity cut in stark contrast to the divisive rhetoric of the National Front.
But the attacks by Boko Haram in Nigeria don't stoke the same fears in the West, former House intelligence committee chairman Mike Rogers said.
While Boko Haram doesn't present as much of a threat to the U.S. as ISIS, Rogers believes U.S. officials should be more concerned about Boko Haram, particularly as the economies in African countries are booming and much of the continent is looking for trade relationships beyond the continent.
In France, around Europe and in the United States, people connected on social media and reacted in real time as they watched each development unfold on cable news or through dramatic videos posted to YouTube.
"There aren't visuals of Baga and what happened there," Pham said of the town ravaged by Boko Haram's militants.
