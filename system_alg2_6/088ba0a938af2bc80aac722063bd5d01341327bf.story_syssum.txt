There was a fierce court battle as a devastated family fought to keep her on life support and doctors argued she had already died.
Doctors and a judge have declared her brain dead and said there's no chance Jahi will come back to life.
Attorneys for the family are filing a new complaint in federal court requesting a temporary restraining order and an injunction to prevent the hospital from disconnecting Jahi from life support, he said.
Asked about the New York facility, Singer said that the hospital has had no "substantive" conversations with any such place.
Before the surgery, Jahi said she was worried that she would never wake up, according to her uncle.
"The medical situation here in this case is that Jahi McMath died several weeks ago."
When asked about the girl's possible movement, the hospital spokesman, citing privacy laws, said he would not comment directly on any claims the family makes.
The case is "giving the impression that dead people can come back to life," Arthur Caplan, director of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center, told CNN last week
His report also says McMath showed no sign of breathing on her own when a ventilator was removed: "Patient failed apnea test."
"We have our strong religious convictions and set of beliefs and we believe that, in this country, a parent has the right to make decisions concerning the existence of their child: not a doctor who looks only at lines on a paper, or reads the cold black and white words on a law that says 'brain dead' and definitely not a doctor who runs the facility that caused the brain death in the first place."
