(CNN) -- Since a temporary radiologic technologist was accused of stealing drugs from a New Hampshire hospital and giving patients hepatitis C through infected syringes, troubling reports of his past have emerged -- casting a spotlight on the staffing industry as a whole.
"Many health care professionals were seeking the flexibility that contract work allowed and were leaving hospitals with vacancies," Berchem said.
Still, the Kwiatkowski case raises questions about the hiring process for both temporary and permanent health care workers.
In 2005, a New Jersey law took effect requiring health care professionals or companies to notify the state Division of Consumer Affairs of concerns or misconduct of health care workers who could endanger patients.
Scott Schnierer, vice president of business development for Comforce Staffing Services, said that most staffing firms conduct a seven-year background check on potential employees.
If there is a problem with an employee, hospitals are asked to report it to the staffing firm, he said.
But it's up to the department manager to report it to HR.
"Many employers are fearful of litigation and will verify employment dates only," Berchem said.
