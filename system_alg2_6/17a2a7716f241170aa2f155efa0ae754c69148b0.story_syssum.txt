But while gimmicks like the "Ferns" appearance may produce some quick-hit results, they won't go far in re-energizing young people about Obama's presidency.
In the case of the health care program, for example, it seems that many young people have not been convinced the program is in their best interest.
Many younger Americans exiting college work multiple jobs to make ends meet or find work in transitory positions without benefits.
In his stimulus bill, passed at the height of his influence, the President focused too much on tax cuts and not enough on the kinds of public jobs that would have been attractive to younger Americans struggling to find a place in the workforce.
The decision to leave government reform behind has had long-term costs, among them a loss of trust among younger Americans in the basic character of the political process.
Nor has President Obama been able to make much progress on an issue that matters very much to younger Americans, one that will affect them much more than seniors who have greater political clout: climate change.
For many younger Americans this has been a great disappointment.
In the near future, the administration must do a better job to explain how the particulars of the health care program benefit younger Americans and to at least try to make progress—even if through executive power—on issues like climate change.
