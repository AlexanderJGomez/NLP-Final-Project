Elton John kisses baby Lev during his visit to the orphanage in Ukraine on Saturday.
James Georgalakis, EveryChild's Communications and Advocacy Manager, told CNN: "Research conducted in the Ukraine in 2007 which showed high-profile celebrity adoptions and news around foreigners coming into the country and adopting children generally was actually encouraging vulnerable young mothers to abandon their children into homes hoping their child would be adopted by a rich foreigner and have a better life.
They are separated from their mothers and often end up in children's homes and institutions segregated from children not affected by HIV.
The judge in that case said the interest of the child outweighed the issue of residency.
BAAF Chief Executive David Holmes told CNN: "While Elton John may be considered too old under current guidance to adopt a baby in the UK, there are many children, particularly older children, sibling groups, children with disabilities, and children from black minority groups, all waiting for a family.
