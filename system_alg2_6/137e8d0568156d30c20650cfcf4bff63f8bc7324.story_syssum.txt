Bobby Petrino is no longer calling Hogs at the University of Arkansas, because somebody by the handle of "hoggrad" on that popular woopig.net website for Razorback fans first reported that the Arkansas football coach wasn't exactly watching game film that evening.
"All of this (instant reporting of scandal) in regards to how it relates to the electronic media has certainly heightened the information and interest and lessened tolerance," said Georgia Tech athletics director Dan Radakovich, who has worked for big-time intercollegiate athletic programs for nearly three decades.
Before, it may have taken a lot longer to make a decision (on whether to fire somebody).
The Eustachy photo was the first in a string of high-profile sports scandals broken by a random person.
That same year, ESPN received an audiotape of a 2002 telephone conversation between the wife of Syracuse associate head basketball coach Bernie Fine and a former team ball boy.
Eustachy.
Not if we're talking about that generation's Petrino, who isn't in line to become the next pope, but who has those worshipping (as in giving financially to) the University of Arkansas as if it were the Vatican of college football.
Petrino had a 21-5 record during the last two of his four years at Arkansas, and one of his Razorback teams earned a berth in the coveted Bowl Championship Series for the first time in school history.
And that Dorrell wasn't his wife or the mother of his four children.
