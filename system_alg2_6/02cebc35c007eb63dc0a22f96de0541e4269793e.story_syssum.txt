Fuller and other journalists were interviewing the general -- better known as Seh Daeng -- in makeshift barricades that protesters have set up in downtown Bangkok.
Fuller said he was just inside the barricades when he was interviewing Seh Daeng.
"He was standing in the same location for a while when I was talking to him but he was moving around, he was gesticulating," Fuller said.
Seh Daeng -- or Red Commander -- is a controversial public figure, even within the protest movement, Fuller said.
More than two dozen civilians and military personnel have died in police-protester clashes in the ongoing unrest.
