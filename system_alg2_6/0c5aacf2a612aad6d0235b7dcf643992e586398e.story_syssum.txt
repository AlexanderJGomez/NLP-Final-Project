London (CNN) -- Global media tycoon Rupert Murdoch is "not a fit person" to run a major international company, British lawmakers investigating phone hacking at his tabloid News of the World reported Tuesday.
"Hard truths have emerged from the Select Committee Report: that there was serious wrongdoing at the News of the World; that our response to the wrongdoing was too slow and too defensive; and that some of our employees misled the Select Committee in 2009," it said in a statement.
Tuesday's report by the Culture, Media and Sport Committee is based, in part, on earlier testimony by Rupert and James Murdoch.
But Louise Mensch, a Conservative member of Parliament who is on the committee with Whittingdale and Watson, said the report had gone too far.
The report did not accuse either Murdoch of misleading Parliament, but said three of their underlings had done so in testimony to the committee.
Mensch noted that Myler, the editor of the New York Daily News, "has misled a select committee of Parliament.
Shares in News Corp., which is traded in New York, closed Tuesday up 2.64%.
"The hacking scandal was not a great national thing until the Milly Dowler disclosure, half of which has been somewhat disowned by the police," Murdoch said.
The scandal has also forced News Corp. to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds in compensation to the victims of phone hacking.
