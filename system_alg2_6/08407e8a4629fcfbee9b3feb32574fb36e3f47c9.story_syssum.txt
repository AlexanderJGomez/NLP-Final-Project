Parkinson knew that Mocha wouldn't be able to pass all that leather on her own.
Parkinson and her husband were just expecting to see a couple metal pieces.
The veterinarian removed "about a pound of leather straps and metal pieces and detritus" during the endoscopy, and let nature take its course for the remaining pieces, MSPCA spokesman Rob Halpin said.
Mocha likes to suck on fleece blankets and has been known to eat rubber ear buds or hair elastics, but nothing like a pile of jewelry, Parkinson said.
"She had a dog that actually consumed her whole dog bed," Parkinson said.
"My husband was all excited about the new Apple watch, but couldn't justify a reason to purchase it since he owned three watches," she said.
