Atlanta (CNN) -- A North Georgia chapter of the Ku Klux Klan has applied to "adopt" a stretch of highway in Union County, Georgia, according to paperwork obtained by CNN on Monday.
"We just want to be with white people.
A federal appeals court ruled the state could not bar the KKK from participating in the program, and the high court declined to review the case, letting that ruling stand.
Georgia has been participating in the Adopt-A-Highway program for more than 20 years.
"I don't see why we can't (adopt the stretch of highway)," she said.
We're just white people that want to stick with white people.
