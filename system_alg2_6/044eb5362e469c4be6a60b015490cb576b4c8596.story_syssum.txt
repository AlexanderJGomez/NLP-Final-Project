At least 79 people died as a result of last week's crash.
Questions have focused on the speed at which the train was traveling as it entered a curve in the track near Santiago de Compostela on Wednesday evening.
At least 63 of the dead are Spanish, she said.
Police forensic experts said at a news conference Saturday there are 37 body parts that must still be tested to see whether they belong to bodies that have already been identified, or to others not yet known.
At least five U.S. citizens were injured, said State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf.
But she said the speed limit for the bend of track where the crash occurred is 80 kph.
Maria Vigo, whose home is on the bank above the rail tracks, told CNN how she heard a crash, then the deafening squeal of metal on concrete.
"She was under wreckage she said she wanted to get out and go home," he said.
The survivors looked like the walking dead, he said.
