The investigation into the actions of former NFL tight end Aaron Hernandez, who is accused of killing friend Odin Lloyd, has turned to Hernandez's fiancee as law enforcement searches for the .45 caliber gun used in the slaying.
The day after Lloyd's body was found, Shaneah Jenkins told authorities she was with her sister, Shayanna, and two uncles at Hernandez's home.
During that time, Shaneah Jenkins said she saw her sister go into the basement with an empty trash bag.
Prosecutors have said no lock box was found in the home.
