Then there's Sister Doris.
The local beer culture notwithstanding, Sister Doris is living proof that women are destined for a higher calling than simply serving beer and starring in Germany's retrograde beer ads.
Only a small handful of women brew beer in Bavaria.
What sets Mallersdorf apart from the handful of other surviving abbey breweries is that Sister Doris is the only remaining nun brewmaster -- in all of Europe.
In what must be the most unusual career move ever made by a nun, when Sister Doris took the veil she became a brewmaster instead, succeeding the elderly Franciscan sister who had been operating the abbey brewery since the 1930s.
"Beer brewing is women's work," she says, adding that female brewers were common in the Middle Ages.
Or to put it the other way around: the smaller the brewery and the closer the brewer is to the brewing process, the more flavorful the beer is likely to be.
Not only is Sister Doris's beer -- luscious as it is -- not exported.
Drinkers need to travel to Germany, but even then, they may not have an easy go of it.
Mallersdorf Abbey has a "brand" and her name is Sister Doris.
