(CNN)Well, the Senate says climate change isn't a hoax.
At least, in a 98-to-1 vote, they said, in public, that climate change is not a hoax.
We learned that 98 senators say climate change is happening -- without blaming humans for it.
We also know that 49 senators voted against the amendment saying climate change is, in fact, caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases.
They're the climate scientists, who have been saying for years that the climate is changing, that human emissions of greenhouse gases are the driving cause, and that we need to act urgently to cut emissions.
Congress should debate how to respond to climate change, not its very existence.
Listen to the science.
