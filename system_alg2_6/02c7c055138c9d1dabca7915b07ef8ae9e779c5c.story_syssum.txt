Isa Saharkhiz and his son Mehdi haven't seen each other in nearly a decade.
Since 2009, the younger Saharkhiz has led a one-man digital campaign from his home in New Jersey aimed at liberating his father.
Iranian security forces first arrested Isa Saharkhiz, 59, during the summer of 2009.
Iranian authorities justified the 2009 crackdown by frequently accusing opposition leaders of being part of a foreign conspiracy aimed at overthrowing the government.
Like others in the reformist movement that emerged from within the ranks of the government of the Islamic Republic, Saharkhiz angered many, including the Supreme Leader," said Behzad Yaghmaian, an Iranian-American academic and author of "Social Change in Iran."
As the elder Saharkhiz languished in prison in 2009, his son Mehdi became an opposition activist from the relative safety of exile in New Jersey.
Four years after his arrest, the elder Saharkhiz said there was no formal reason given for his release.
Last month, he called for a negotiated end to Tehran's long feud with Washington over its nuclear program.
"There's a lot of hope from what Rouhani did in the U.S. and there's a lot of good response from the people," Mehdi said.
"Maybe in a few years I will be able to go back, but it's a really big risk," he said.
"It will be a very emotional time," Isa Saharkhiz said.
