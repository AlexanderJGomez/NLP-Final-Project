Whether a trip to the McLeod Ganj just above Dharamsala in northern India -- the hometown of the Dalai Lama -- offers an easy route is open to question.
Like thousands of others he's on his way to listen to a three-day teaching on wisdom and compassion.
During the event, the Dalai Lama appears each morning at 8 a.m., led by plain clothes armed policemen and followed by a small entourage of a handful of monks carrying pots of burning incense.
Many of the younger travelers make their way back up the rocky paths to nearby hillside communities of Bhagsu and Dharamkot at the end of the day.
While the culture of the towns, Dharamsala and McLeod Ganj, are predominantly Tibetan Buddhist, the small surrounding villages are more Indian and attract an international hippy crowd.
The Dalai Lama offers teachings at Dharamsala a few times every year but also in different places.
