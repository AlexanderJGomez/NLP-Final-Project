No one has found the 276 girls abducted from their school last month by the terror group Boko Haram.
"When I went into the school compound, nobody will ever stand it," said the father, who is not being identified for fear of reprisals from attackers or the government.
Armed members of Boko Haram attacked the school on April 14, overpowering the guards and herding the girls onto waiting trucks, according to accounts of that night.
"We're not Americans.
They know his family, the father says.
They know about his daughters.
"We sleep in the bush with all of our little ones," he said.
I will sell women.
The mother of the two girls had little response, just tears.
Please ... release them."
