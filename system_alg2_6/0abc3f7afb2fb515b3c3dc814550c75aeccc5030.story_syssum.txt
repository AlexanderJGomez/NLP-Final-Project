Pastor Ted Haggard acknowledged on CNN's "Larry King Live" that he had a second relationship with a man.
Controversy involving Haggard first erupted in November 2006, when a former prostitute, Mike Jones, said the pastor had paid him for sex over three years and had used methamphetamine in his presence.
In a settlement with New Life, the church and Haggard agreed that he would retain his six-figure salary for a year, leave the Colorado Springs area, receive counseling and not speak publicly about what had happened for one year, according to a church staff member with knowledge of the settlement but who was not authorized to speak on the record.
I'm very grateful to him," Haggard said.
Haggard said he had thought that focusing on his spiritual life would help, but found that it did not.
"The first said, 'You are a heterosexual with homosexual attachments.'
"I really do love this man," she told CNN when asked why she did not leave.
"I knew that Ted had some struggles in this area, particularly in his thoughts.
Asked if he wants to return to the pulpit, Haggard said, "I think Gail and I both want to tell our story to the degree that it's helpful to other people.
