"Our Palestinian brothers should declare an independent state," Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced to an assembly of Arab foreign ministers in Cairo.
Erdogan said the rebel council "reflects the will of the [Libyan] people."
The assembled foreign ministers applauded when Erdogan said, "Israel should compensate the rights of the families of the victims.
"Erdogan he did not mention Syria," said Syrian film director Maan Alhasba.
The Turkish government has repeatedly criticized the brutal military crackdown on protesters in Syria, but Erdogan made no mention of Turkey's neighbor to the east during his speech in the Arab League.
