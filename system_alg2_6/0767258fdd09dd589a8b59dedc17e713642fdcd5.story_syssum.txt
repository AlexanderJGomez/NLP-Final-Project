(Real Simple) -- I live in Chicago, and one of my best friends, Phyllis, lives in San Francisco, so we aren't able to see each other as often as we would like.
"You're going to love this place," I kept saying, and Phyllis, in turn, kept saying, "Oh boy."
Suddenly I remembered that my neighbor Suzie had given me a recipe, saying, "I really liked this, and I think you will, too."
But now Suzie's recipe seemed just right for the occasion, even though neither Phyllis nor I, experienced (and good) cooks both, knew exactly what a "ragout" was.
Then Phyllis lowered the volume on the stereo and came to sit down at the kitchen table.
Instead, what she said, in a very small, tremulous voice, was "I don't think you liked what I gave you for your birthday."
She's good at coming up with things you never would have thought of for yourself but instantly love.
I said, "It's not your gift I didn't like -- it was me I wasn't so crazy about."
The person who wrote those letters spent an awful lot of time feeling bad: about herself, about choices she had made, about life in general.
And some time after my birthday, I found myself paging through Phyllis's gift.
I told Phyllis that I was sorry for how I had made her feel and that I hadn't told her I had come to appreciate the gift.
Sometimes that place is the stomach.
And sometimes, the best times, it's both.
