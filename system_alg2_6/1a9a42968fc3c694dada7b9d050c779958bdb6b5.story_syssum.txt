I've been listening to that one a lot more and kind of stuck on the sound of that record.
Both of those productions really appeal to me, and the direction that they took -- just trying to get ideas for myself.
So it's just really determining where am I really at and just looking through that.
I've just got to get myself to that next stage.
It's overwhelming, and it's overwhelming trying to pinpoint who to go with on this project, because it will determine a lot of the direction, and I'm committing myself.
And I've had a lot of fun just being creative with it and just floating around, changing my mind.
The show took well over a year to put together, so that was a production in itself, like making a record.
So I'm only recently freed up from going into one production and just getting geared up to go into another one, which should be the record.
I want people to hear the songs they know.
Sting I've seen a few times and he really inspired me, in the sense that he breaks the songs down a lot and will take a different approach.
So I did some of that.
