London, England (CNN) -- London's two major airports were closed Monday as a cloud of ash from a volcano in Iceland moved east into England, British air authorities said.
In addition, Dublin's airport closed overnight, the Irish Aviation Authority said Sunday, and will remain closed until at least 9 a.m. (4 a.m.) Monday.
British Airways said it would notify passengers of potential disruptions on its website.
There's no way to know how long the volcano will continue spewing ash into the air, Georgia Tech scientist Josef Dufek told CNN.
British ministers agreed Saturday that five-day ash-prediction charts would now be made available to airlines, other transport providers and the public on the Met Office website.
