"When a big rain would come, she'd always get out and dance in the rain," the teen's mother, Auliea Hanlon, said.
And she had the most beautiful laugh," Hanlon said.
One of Cherice's peers at a church counseling group broke the news to Hanlon in 2008: Cherice, then 14, had been raped by Stacey Rambold, a business teacher at Billings Senior High School.
He would recant and apologize later, but Judge G. Todd Baugh defended the sentence at the time by saying that Cherice looked older than her age and that the 14-year-old was as much in control of the situation as Rambold.
In many ways Cherice was a typical kid.
A 15-year-old Cherice banged up a car and the backyard fence trying to take the canines for a ride, Hanlon said.
Hanlon enjoyed listening to Puddle of Mudd, Will Smith and Cherice's favorite band, Nickelback, while her daughter grew to love Pink Floyd and Melissa Etheridge.
In school, Cherice often excelled.
She also enjoyed poetry, and Hanlon described her daughter's style as "darker," reminiscent of Edgar Allan Poe.
Her daughter asked what she wanted for Christmas, and Hanlon replied that she'd like a poem.
