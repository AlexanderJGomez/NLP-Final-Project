(CNN) -- We moved to suburban Akron in January 2003, just months before LeBron James graduated from St. Vincent-St. Mary High School and was drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers.
You see, my sons like James.
The city is experiencing a renaissance and the world is taking note, even if national media is having a hard time embracing it.
The Cleveland Browns have a hopeful new star and the prodigal son is coming home.
Yes, Cleveland was heartbroken when James announced his decision to go to Miami.
Still, James' departure stung.
Months later, I wrote a personal letter to James that I never mailed.
As political analysts second-guessed this week's RNC choice rather than the selection of Dallas and as sports analysts complained about having to spend more time working in Cleveland rather than sipping mojitos on South Beach, the people who live here have a deeply affectionate relationship with the city.
Ours is pride that comes from feeling like someone has finally stood up for you.
On Friday, LeBron James stood up for Cleveland, for Akron, for northeast Ohio.
