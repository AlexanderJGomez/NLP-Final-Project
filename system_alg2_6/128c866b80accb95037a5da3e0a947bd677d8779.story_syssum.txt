For me, it brought back memories of my dad, who fought the Nazis in Europe.
Dad was not amused.
Later, Dad explained to me that his strong emotions went back nearly 15 years when he was an officer on Gen. William Woodward's staff during the 104th Infantry Division's assault on Nazi Germany.
Dad told me about seeing a couple of soldiers carelessly tossing bodies into the back of a truck to be hauled away from the battlefield.
Dad was a shy man, placid, slow to anger.
At the Atlanta reunion, I had a chance to relay Dad's appreciation of the infantry to several of the veterans I met -- and I listened as many of them talked about their experiences.
"I just shut down completely," he said.
I asked several of the men.
An experience, I fear, that will be lost forever if more of us don't encourage these men and women to tell their stories for history.
