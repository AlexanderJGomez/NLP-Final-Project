Washington (CNN) -- Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan took a pragmatic approach to the issue of late-term abortion when working as a top lawyer in the Clinton White House, documents released Friday show.
The documents reveal another person heavily involved in the abortion issue: Rahm Emanuel, then a senior adviser in the Clinton White House.
Kagan also was heavily involved in negotiations to clamp down on the tobacco industry.
Kagan, then 37, also noted proposals from within the administration might go too far and later be declared unconstitutional by the federal courts.
On affirmative action, Kagan weighed in on a pending Supreme Court challenge by a white teacher in New Jersey who had been fired in favor of a black teacher, when both had equal seniority.
At the time, the Clinton administration had to decide whether to continue the legal challenge in federal courts.
