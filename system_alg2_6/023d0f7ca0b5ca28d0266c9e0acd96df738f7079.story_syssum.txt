Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia are at the center of an Ebola outbreak that has already killed more than 800 people.
The 40-year-old man has symptoms of a viral hemorrhagic fever, the Saudi Health Ministry said Tuesday.
A Nigerian doctor has been diagnosed with Ebola nearly three weeks after a Liberian-American man with Ebola died after traveling to Lagos, Nigerian officials said Monday.
The Ebola virus causes viral hemorrhagic fever, which affects multiple organ systems in the body and is often accompanied by bleeding.
But in the nations hardest-hit and not as prepared, the reality is grim.
Ebola also claimed the life of a medical director at a hospital in Liberia's capital, Monrovia.
On Tuesday, Liberia responded to British Airways' decision to suspend service to Monrovia because of the outbreak.
