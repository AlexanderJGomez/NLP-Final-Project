This Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people are taking to the streets around the world in the largest climate mobilization in history.
The voice of global concern for action on climate change is back, and this time it's no longer an environmental issue, it's an everybody issue.
But none of this is grounds for despair.
We need to shift our societies and economies off dirty energy and on to 100% clean, sustainable energy, within a generation.
And that is why the People's Climate March is so critical.
Saving ourselves by shifting our societies to 100% clean energy will require one of the largest, most diverse, and most sustained movements we've ever seen.
The Paris summit next year is when we'll need our leaders to sign a new global agreement.
But our civilization is the first truly global one, with the power to end human life.
For the sake of our children and their children, we must find the hope, wisdom and unity to save it.
