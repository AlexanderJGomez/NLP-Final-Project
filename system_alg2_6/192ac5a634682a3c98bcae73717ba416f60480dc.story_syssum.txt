Players control Pit with the device's circle pad and use its stylus to aim and turn him.
On the ground (because apparently this angel has a limit on how much he can fly), Pit navigates through a series of rooms and pathways, defeating enemies and collecting hearts.
Hearts are the currency by which players can obtain new weapons and skills.
If you want more, you bet hearts that you can complete the chapter, winning you more hearts.
If there is a downside to the game, it is the dialogue.
Overall, "Kid Icarus: Uprising" does offer some solid combat, some great visuals and a good soundtrack.
