Add Southwest Airlines to the list of U.S. airlines that have received Federal Aviation Administration approval to allow passengers to use many portable electronic devices in all phases of flight.
Other airlines are moving to get FAA approval to allow greater electronic use.
Those airlines have to get their own FAA approval.
The new expanded use of electronics does not apply to making or taking calls, which are still prohibited in flight.
