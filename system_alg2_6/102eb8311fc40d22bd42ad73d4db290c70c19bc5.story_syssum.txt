A new study published in the January 2008 issue of Archives of General Psychiatry found the prevalence of autism cases in California children continued to rise after most vaccine manufacturers started to remove the mercury-based preservative thimerosal in 1999, suggesting that the chemical was not a primary cause of the disorder.
In 1999, manufacturers began removing thimerosal - which is a mercury-based preservative - from vaccines.
But advocacy groups say it's too soon to determine whether autism rates were affected by removing thimerosal from vaccines.
The National Vaccine Information Center says the study doesn't include children under the age of 3, which they say is the only group that was never exposed to mercury in vaccines.
Doctors are now looking for signs of autism in children as young as 18 to 24 months.
Some of them used thimerosal as a preservative.
In 1997, Congress passed a bill that mandated review of products containing mercury, which led manufacturers to begin removing thimerosal from vaccines two years later.
