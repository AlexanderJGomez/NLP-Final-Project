New York (CNN) -- Staring down a smoking homemade bomb and dismantling it is dangerous enough.
I identified it as a bomb, and I had to look twice," Clair said.
During one recent 16-hour shift, I watched the same five-man team who worked the bungled bomb plot in Times Square check their equipment, catch up on paperwork and make sure Dan-O, their explosives-sniffing dog, was raring to go.
It was.
Put on gloves, and it's hard to imagine that anyone in such bulky gear could maneuver and dismantle possible bomb components.
"The more you do, and the more you get involved, the better you'll get when it's the real thing," Clair said.
Despite the immense dangers associated with the work, whenever the unit checks out a suspicious package, bomb technicians jockey for the opportunity to suit up.
John Ryan said it's necessary to assume the worst until the team moves in.
"At the end of the day, it's just one day down and a lot more to go," said Det.
