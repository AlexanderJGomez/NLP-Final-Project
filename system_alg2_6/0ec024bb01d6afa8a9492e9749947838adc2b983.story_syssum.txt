An attorney for White's family said that because White was being held in solitary confinement at the Prince George's County Correctional Center, a corrections officer would have had to let whoever killed the prisoner into his cell.
The FBI's Baltimore field office said it has opened a civil rights investigation into White's death.
White family attorney Bobby Henry said there are only two ways someone could get into solitary confinement.
White had not had the opportunity to meet with an attorney, Henry said.
"At this very moment, the family has not even seen the body of their loved one," Henry said.
Prince George's County State's Attorney Glenn Ivey said a grand jury will be convened in the case.
