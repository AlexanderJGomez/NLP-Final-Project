Annecy is the Cannes of animation.
One veteran of Annecy is Craig Decker, known as worldwide cult figure "Spike" and co-founder of "Spike and Mike's Sick & Twisted Festival of Animation."
One of Spike and Mike's biggest fans, Nick Park, won the Annecy award for Best TV Animation with "Shaun the Sheep," a spin-off from "A Close Shave," one of Aardman's famous Wallace and Gromit short features that grabbed an Oscar.
"I think there's room for all types of animation," she continued.
Animation requires a combination of several skills, as producer Allison Abbate explained.
Spike believes animation is going mobile.
