Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Dozens of people have been killed during two days of clashes between Islamist militants and Nigerian security forces in a northeastern town, an army commander said.
Residents say the group was involved, but the military has not yet commented.
After Boko Haram's leader was killed in police custody in 2009, its members began carrying out a campaign of sporadic violence which has been fueled by the military's iron-fisted approach, experts say.
On the other, the Nigerian forces cannot crush the group through use of force," he told CNN.
