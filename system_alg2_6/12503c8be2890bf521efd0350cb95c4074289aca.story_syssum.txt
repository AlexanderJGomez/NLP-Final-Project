"The defeat of the U.S. is imminent, inshallah," Shahzad said during the sentencing.
"We are pleased that this terrorist has been sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison, after providing substantial intelligence to our interrogators, and a speedy civilian trial," Shapiro said.
He pointed to the ceiling and said "Allahu akbar," or God is great, and he said he didn't care about the sentence.
"The Quran gives us the right to defend ourselves," he said.
Shahzad is accused of attempting to set off a vehicle bomb in Times Square on May 1, according to documents filed in federal court.
In addition, Shahzad was given $5,000 to help fund the mission and agreed to appear in a TTP video glorifying the planned attack.
The roughly 40-minute video, according to its description in the memo, features Shahzad quoting from the Quran while the other side of the screen is filled with images of Times Square after the botched bombing.
