A fourth person, an MIT police officer, was ambushed and killed in his patrol car three days after the bombings as Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, allegedly ran from police.
"I'm jealous of my brother who ha (bullet hole) ceived the reward of jannutul Firdaus (inshallah) before me," one of the writings said, referring to the word for paradise.
Well at least that's how muhhammad (bullet hole) wanted it to be (for)ever," Tsarnaev wrote in the boat.
Prosecutors argued that these tweets indicate an attack on the Boston Marathon was on his mind a year before the bombings.
CNN's Ann O'Neill reported from Boston, and Mariano Castillo wrote in Atlanta.
