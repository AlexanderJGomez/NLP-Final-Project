(CNN) -- Former Agriculture Department employee Shirley Sherrod said Thursday she will pursue a lawsuit against conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart.
"This was not about Shirley Sherrod," Breitbart told CNN's John King.
"I'm also waiting for Ms. Sherrod to publicly apologize for accusing anyone opposed to nationalized healthcare of being racist," Bozell said.
Obama said earlier Thursday that Sherrod "deserves better than what happened last week."
Speaking at a National Urban League conference in Washington, Obama called the claim of racism against her "bogus."
