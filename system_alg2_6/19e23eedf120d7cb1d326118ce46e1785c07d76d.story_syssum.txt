Walnut Creek, California (CNN) -- Dueling rallies took place Monday involving a former Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer who was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the shooting death of an unarmed passenger.
There was some shouting between the two sides.
Police said at its peak, there appeared to be about 300 people at the event.
Mehserle, who is white, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the 2009 shooting death of Grant, an unarmed black man who was on a train platform at the Fruitvale station in nearby Oakland.
"This is a PEACEFUL rally to show our support for Johannes, his family and our law enforcement officers."
Mehserle faces two to four years in prison at his scheduled August 6 sentencing.
Although police said they were prepared for possible clashes, some people in this normally placid town were not unduly concerned that the rallies might get out of control, even though protests after the verdict in nearby Oakland led to the arrest of 78 people.
Mehserle and other Bay Area Rapid Transit police had been called to the Fruitvale station after passengers complained about fights on a train.
