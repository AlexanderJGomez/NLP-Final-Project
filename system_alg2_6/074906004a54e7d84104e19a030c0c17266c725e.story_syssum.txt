(CNN) -- The Obama administration vastly underestimated the tens of thousands of barrels of oil pouring into the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon disaster, despite contrary information from scientists using better methodologies, a report from a national panel investigating the response said Wednesday.
Federal officials have stated that the low flow-rate estimates did not negatively affect their operations to stop the oil spill.
After the oil rig sank, the U.S. Coast Guard and BP initially put the spill at 1,000 barrels per day.
Soon after the spill, the Minerals Management Service and BP reported a worst-case estimate of 162,000 barrels, but that was replaced by another estimate received by the Coast Guard and NOAA of 64,000 to 110,000 barrels per day.
Better video and data led to the rise in the daily oil spill estimate, he said.
The federal government later Wednesday said it acted appropriately with regard to spill estimates and the clean-up.
"As directed by the President, the response was based on science, even when that pitted us against BP or state and local officials, and the response pushed BP every step of the way.
