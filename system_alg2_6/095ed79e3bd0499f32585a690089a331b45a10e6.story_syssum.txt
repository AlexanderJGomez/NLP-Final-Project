There was a beautiful Chinese-built theater; also the main public library, at one time the biggest in Somalia," recalls Jama Muse Jama, who six years ago founded the Hargeisa Book Fair.
The theater and library, like much of Hargeisa, was flattened during the civil war that preceded Somalia's collapse and Somaliland's declaration of independence.
That year, Somali President Mohammed Siad Barre introduced a standard written version of the Somali language using Latin script.
"It was one of the best things that happened in Somali society," he says.
Jama recalls books being burned at his school library.
Saleh points out that new books are again being translated into Somali.
