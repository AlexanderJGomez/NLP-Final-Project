Low-wage workers have been the hardest hit since the onset of the financial crisis, and low-wage jobs remain a fixture of the new economy.
Congress should help low-wage workers gain access to predictable work schedules.
A University of Chicago study found that 41% of early career hourly workers and 47% who work part-time received a week or less of notice of their work schedules.
Nearly 50% of African-Americans and Latinos receive their hours with a week or less notice.
Because of erratic shifts, child care centers often can't accommodate a working mother's schedule.
Real solutions exist.
Too many people work in states with little protection.
The bill protects families and allows them to attend to their many obligations, not just work.
Conversely, just-in-time scheduling increases worker turnover and hurts worker satisfaction.
They can start by passing legislation that better protects shift workers from arbitrary and unpredictable scheduling practices.
