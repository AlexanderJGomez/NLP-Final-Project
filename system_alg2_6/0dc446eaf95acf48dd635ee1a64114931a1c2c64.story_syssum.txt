EW: How much did you know that you were getting evicted?
EW: Yeah, it's true.
McGuire: Ah, well, I was making deals all the way up to the last day, so I didn't know until the last day.
McGuire: Yes.
McGuire: I don't know.
I mean, everybody told her that she would either have to use it or she'd be going home because everyone would vote her out for keeping me here.
McGuire: Yeah, I was warned a little bit about some of the things.
McGuire: Yeah, I'm not racist, sexist, or homophobic, so I mean, I guess everything can be taken out of context.
EW: Well, I don't know how much some of these words can be twisted or misinterpreted.
McGuire: Yeah, yeah.
McGuire: [Laughs] I don't know because I don't know what you're talking about.
McGuire: Yeah, I'm going back to the boat.
McGuire: I think me and Kaitlin will.
How so?
EW: Yeah.
I feel the same way.
