Vancouver, British Columbia (CNN) -- Many kids dream of being in the Olympics one day.
"I knew that there was something better," Schuffenhauer, 36, said last week as he readied for his third Olympic Games.
"She reminded me to never give up and always push on," he said.
Track and field was to be a turning point; he had real friends now and the parents of one of his teammates eventually would adopt him.
His conversion to bobsledder came thanks to a friend who told him there was a new track in Park City where the U.S. team was training for the 2002 Winter Olympics.
One of the Olympic team members on the top U.S. four-man team tested positive for steroids, so Schuffenhauer was called into duty.
He and Savage had to solve a dilemma: either he would give up on the idea of another Olympics or he would go back to full-time training with the team.
The bank kicked them out, and Savage and the kids moved into a rental while Schuffenhauer went away for seven months at a time.
At the beginning of the 2008-2009 season, Schuffenhauer suffered a serious injury, two herniated disks in his neck, that made it difficult to use his arms to push the sled.
I'm here.
But Schuffenhauer has faced improbable many times before.
Asked if those chapters will take written form one day, he said he had considered it, but right now he has a family to return to.
