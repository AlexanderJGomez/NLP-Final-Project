Malaysian authorities apparently did not check the stolen documents on an international law enforcement agency database, CNN has learned.
The police official said that Maraldi had reported his passport stolen in Malaysia last August and had obtained a new one.
The names of the persons whose passports were stolen have been circulated and checked, the official said.
Malaysian authorities apparently did not check Interpol's database, sources told Fuentes.
Referring to the stolen documents, Fuentes added, "You wonder who was using it?
In the United States, Fuentes said, passports are routinely checked against the Interpol database.
"It's rare that you have one stolen passport, much less two stolen passports on a flight.
She added it was especially surprising given the destination of the flight was Beijing.
No one is sure what happened to the plane.
