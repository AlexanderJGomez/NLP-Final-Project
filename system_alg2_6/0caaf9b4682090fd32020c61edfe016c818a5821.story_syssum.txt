"It is very disappointing that we have lost our first home match," Van Gaal told BT Sport in his post game interview.
A busy pre-season witnessed promising victories over Liverpool, Roma, Valencia and Real Madrid.
United began with a 3-5-2 system similar to that employed by Van Gaal's Dutch side at the World Cup earlier this summer before switching to a 4-4-1-1 as the game progressed.
Like many a visitor to Old Trafford, Swansea sat in deep and attempted to play on the break.
With more solid, mature performances like this over the coming season such predictions will be made to look badly placed.
