Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan was released from home confinement at 10:20 a.m. Wednesday, 35 days after she began serving her sentence for misdemeanor theft and probation violation, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County sheriff said Wednesday.
Lohan must now resume work on the 480 hours of community service ordered as part of her sentence, including 360 hours at the Los Angeles Downtown Women's Center.
Lohan entered drug rehab last year to avoid a jail sentence imposed by another judge.
Lohan tested positive for alcohol use, a violation of probation rules, in February, the report said.
It also revealed that the drug test failure last August, which resulted in a jail sentence and court-ordered rehab, involved cocaine and amphetamines.
