His 1 km swim (0.62 of a mile) in 2007 made him the first person to complete a long-distance swim at the North Pole -- the purpose, to highlight the fact that it was possible to swim for a kilometer in a place that should be solid ice.
The next year, Pugh became the first person to swim the 87 mile-width of the Maldives.
Pugh's long-time coach Professor Tim Noakes told CNN, "People usually drown very quickly on exposure to cold water because they start to hyperventilate and when you hyperventilate you can't coordinate.
Noakes recorded an increase in Pugh's body temperature and over the next fortnight, as Pugh was exposed to more cold-water swims, he was able to increase his temperature even further, peaking at 38.4 C.
Noakes told CNN "The moment you dive into cold water your temperature drops and the brain sends a message to get out of the water.
"I can taste salt water in my mouth.
If the Arctic swim was intended to highlight shrinking polar ice caps, Pugh acknowledges that there's still plenty of work to do on that front and he now speaks on environmental issues all over the world.
