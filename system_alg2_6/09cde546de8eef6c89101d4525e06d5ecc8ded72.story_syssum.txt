(CNN) -- President Obama rallied U.S. troops and pledged continued partnership with Afghanistan during a previously unannounced trip to the country Sunday.
"All of that makes America safer, and we are going to keep them on the run," he said.
We persevere.
Obama then flew on a helicopter to the Presidential Palace to meet with Karzai.
U.S. officials said the two leaders planned to first meet along with key aides, and then bring in Karzai's cabinet.
U.S. officials said Sunday there were nearly 80,000 U.S. troops now on the ground in Afghanistan, and the surge announced by Obama would increase the total to 98,000 once fully implemented by the end of the year.
Karzai has said that by the end of 2010, Afghan security forces will be able to take over some security responsibilities from international forces.
On that visit, part of a broader trip to the Middle East, Obama traveled to eastern Afghanistan to meet with U.S. forces and also met with Karzai.
