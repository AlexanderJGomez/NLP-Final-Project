Israeli airstrikes killed at least five more people in Gaza on Saturday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
The Israel Defense Forces said that, since the end of the cease-fire early Friday, about 100 rockets were fired toward Israel from Gaza.
There have been efforts to halt the bloodshed as well as to broach some of the thorny issues related to it.
Israeli officials say 64 Israeli soldiers have died, and three civilians were killed in Israel.
Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said it was Hamas' fault regardless, telling CNN the group runs Gaza and "can't outsource terrorism to the other groups.
The two groups have been at odds but also made repeated efforts at a unity government, including one earlier this year.
But Israel was willing to extend fishing rights to only six miles off the coast, said Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri.
CNN's Jethro Mullen, Ali Younes, Tal Heinrich, Jake Tapper and Samira Said also contributed to this report.
