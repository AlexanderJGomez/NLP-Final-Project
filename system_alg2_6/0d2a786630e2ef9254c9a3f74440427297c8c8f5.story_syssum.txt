And Foxy Loxy is concerned there will be massive job losses and our economy will crash.
Here's why:
So, the real reduction in federal spending this year is just 1.2%.
It is true that the cuts are not spread equally across all types of federal spending.
In fact, defense spending would really be cut, in the sense of actually spending less, over the next two years.
Keeping all this in perspective, over the entire 10-year period covered by the sequester, defense spending would average roughly $100 billion more each year (after adjusting for inflation) than we spent at the height of the cold war.
This entire argument buys into the Keynesian conceit that government spending creates jobs over the long term.
Given that the private sector generally puts those resources to a more productive use, it is likely that government spending destroys more jobs over the long run than it creates.
