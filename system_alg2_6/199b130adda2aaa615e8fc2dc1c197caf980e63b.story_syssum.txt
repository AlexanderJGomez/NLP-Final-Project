The most common lie on a résumé has to do with education, said Kim Isaacs, founder and director of ResumePower.com and Monster.com's résumé expert.
The discovery that Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson does not have a bachelor's degree in accounting and computer science (he has a bachelor of science degree in business administration, with a major in accounting) makes him the latest executive to be targeted for falsely claiming to have a degree.
"Thompson has a degree in accounting, not computer science, but frankly at this point in his career does it really matter what he studied as an undergraduate?"
Résumé padding has become a point of increasing concern for companies big and small, prompting them to step up screening methods and background checks for job applicants, according to HireRight's Employment Screening Benchmarking Report.
People often omit months in the start and end dates of their last jobs to exaggerate periods of employment and minimize unemployment.
People see job postings for which they feel they have the right experience but not the requisite degree, prompting them to fabricate an extra line on their résumés, Isaacs said.
It's easy to disparage Thompson, she said, but given the high incidence of résumé padding in general, people should use this opportunity to take a second look at their own résumés.
