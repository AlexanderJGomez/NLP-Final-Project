(CNN) -- Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan hit the campaign trail Thursday to pitch energy policy and defense spending, as new polls showed President Barack Obama maintaining a slight lead in three key swing states after Romney named the conservative House Budget Committee chairman as his running mate.
The CBO report, which was requested by Ryan, said 70% of the nation's oil and gas reserves already were available for drilling.
Obama has touted increased oil production in recent years, and also opened up new areas for drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and indicated he'll issue permits to drill in the Arctic.
The event came a day after a new CBO report outlined the potentially dismal impact of the impending "fiscal cliff" that includes the expiration of the Bush tax cuts and mandatory reductions in government spending, including defense outlays.
"Under a Mitt Romney administration, this will not happen," Ryan said of the automatic cuts to military spending.
In Florida, support for Romney ticked up 1 percentage point from a poll taken before Ryan was added to the ticket.
With a potential hurricane possibly heading toward Tampa, Florida, the site of the Republican convention scheduled to begin Monday, GOP officials made clear Thursday that Romney would be nominated as the party's presidential candidate next week regardless of whether the storm disrupts proceedings.
A new Obama campaign ad released Thursday features former President Bill Clinton -- in increasingly visible surrogate for Obama.
In his stump speeches, Obama frequently credits Clinton-era policies for the strong economy in the 1990s.
