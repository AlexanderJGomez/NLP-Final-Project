County administrator Brenda T. Buck is trying hard to help create eight to 10 sawmill jobs for Jefferson County.
â€¢ The Census Bureau lists the population of Jefferson County as 86 percent African American, the highest percentage of any county in the United States.
Her parents agreed to care for her children when she had to travel, for months at a time, as far away as Arizona.

Buck spends hours a day trying to help, and most of her time with the Board of Supervisors is spent debating economic development ideas.

On average, the men make about $100 day, and Paul Southerland, the company's general manager, says the noise and activity attracts others who are down on their luck.

"If we had that sawmill, we would be able to add eight or 10 more folks," Southerland said.
"My philosophy, when I walk through the doors in the morning, just like a sandwich: take one bite at a time."
It's a win-win for any family."
