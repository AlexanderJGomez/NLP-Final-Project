Inspired by a U.S. fact-checking website, a group of Egyptian activists has created the Morsi Meter, aimed at holding the new Egyptian president to his promises.
Sobhy said that while it's unclear how much power the president will have, he hopes Morsi fulfills promises through selecting "a good government" and gaining public support.
"What matters to me here is how much support we are gaining, unexpectedly," for the Morsi Meter, he said.
The site currently lists 64 promises.
It's a new form of journalism that holds public officials accountable for their campaign promises.
