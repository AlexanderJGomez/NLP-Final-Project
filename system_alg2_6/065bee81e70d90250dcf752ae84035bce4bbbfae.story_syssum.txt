After prosecutors brought charges against Hernandez, the Patriots offered fans who had purchased Hernandez jerseys the chance to trade them in.
The exchange applied only to Hernandez jerseys purchased from the Patriots' ProShop and PatriotsProShop.com.
Lloyd's body was found in the industrial park later that day, authorities say.
