There will be quick-fire Spanish, varying degrees of English and jokes in the way I've only ever heard my Cuban relatives parry back and forth.
When they applied to leave the country, Cuban government officials did an inventory of the contents of their home.
And Cuban and U.S. flags will be everywhere.
Every bit of Cuba I get is gleaned from pictures, music, stories people tell me and these trips to see Miami family, where I get hints of my ancestry in the food and jokes and presents.
Around midday on Christmas Eve some of us will head to El Palacio de Los Jugos for lunch and Cuban sandwiches.
My definition of beauty isn't blond hair or blue eyes or any classic American stereotype.
To Miami, not to Cuba.
I don't want to hear any more stereotypes about who my people are or tourists talking about going to visit Cuba "before it changes."
I want to put those hints together, fill in the gaps and see for the first time, where I am from.
