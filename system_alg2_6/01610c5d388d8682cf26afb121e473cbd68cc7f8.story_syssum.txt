WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The man who revealed that Valerie Plame worked for the CIA said that he was "extraordinarily foolish" to leak her name.
"There was no ill intent on my part, and I had never seen, ever in 43 years of having a security clearance, a covert operative's name in a memo," he said.
Neither Armitage nor Rove was charged with a crime in the leak.
Wilson and Plame have accused Rove and other Bush officials of leaking her identity as a CIA officer in retaliation for her husband's emergence as an administration critic.
