But instead of the "liberty-only" patriotism of Reagan and political descendants such as Paul Ryan, who would turn love of country into hate for its government and its people, Obama offered a deeper "liberty and justice for all" patriotism.
Reagan offered up a vision of an over-taxed, long-neglected "We the People"; Obama's version of "We the People" is youthful, diverse, energetic and engaged.
Instead of "government is the problem," the president reminded us that we could all fall victim to sudden misfortune.
I do not think that following through will be easy, or that the president will do everything right.
