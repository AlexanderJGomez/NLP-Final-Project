Doctors said Lakshmi was recovering well as she appeared Tuesday at a news conference.
The surgery involved the removal of the extra limbs and the repositioning of Lakshmi's organs.
After Patil visited the girl in her village from Narayana Health City hospital in Bangalore, the hospital's foundation agreed to fund the $200,000 operation.
Planning for the surgery took a month, Patil said, and Lakshmi spent that month in the hospital.
