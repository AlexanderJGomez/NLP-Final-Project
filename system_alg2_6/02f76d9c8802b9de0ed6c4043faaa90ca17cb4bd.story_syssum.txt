Around the world renewable energy is going through a rebirth.
Yet it is still a relatively small business compared to the overall energy business, and one that still faces big challenges in getting to scale on a global basis.
The rise of climate change as a central issue in energy policy drove governments to much more actively promote carbon-free electricity.
In order to meet its rapidly growing needs for energy, China is pursuing all options -- oil and coal and natural gas and nuclear power, as well as renewables.
Over the last decade, growing support by governments for renewable energy has been critical to its development.
Renewables need to overcome two big hurdles.
One solution is more use of natural gas as renewables' "partner" -- to generate electricity at those times when the sun and wind are off duty.
The costs of solar energy continue to come down, and many of the new approaches under development and in the lab are aimed at further cost reductions.
To achieve big impact, however, renewables still need to establish that they are competitive at large scale.
As costs go down, more solar will come into use around the world.
In other words, wind and solar have much ground to cover, and it will take time.
Renewable will be part of a growing global business that will be measured in hundreds of billions of dollars.
