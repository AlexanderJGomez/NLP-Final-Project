(CNN)  -- Low visibility caused by mist and sand created poor flying conditions for the pilot of an Afriqiyah Airways flight that crashed just before landing in Tripoli, Libyan sources with knowledge of the investigation said Saturday.
The family, which will raise Ruben, said the boy knows that his parents and brother were killed.
"The coming period will be very difficult for us," the family said.
More than two-thirds of the passengers killed in the plane crash were Dutch, the ministry said.
