Michael Vick will be confined to this Hampton, Virginia, house for the rest of his sentence.
A federal bankruptcy judge recently denied a plan presented by Vick and urged him to offer another plan to handle his debts.
The original plan called for Vick to come up with $750,000 to $1 million in cash to be paid to creditors, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Frank Santoro said, but he said he saw no evidence Vick could come up with that much.
