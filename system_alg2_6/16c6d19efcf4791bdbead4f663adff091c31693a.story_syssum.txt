The three injured students have been released from hospitals, the sheriff's office said.
After the stabbings, students were kept in classrooms for safety and to allow authorities to interview witnesses, said the superintendent of Spring Independent School District, Ralph Draper.
Dauth said she was disappointed that she learned about the incident through her son and the local media hours before the school district contacted her.
The district gave automated phone and e-mail messages to parents about three hours after the stabbings, she said.
