The bodies of William Parente, 59; his wife, Betty, 58; and their daughters Stephanie, 19, and Catherine, 11, were found Monday in a room at the Sheraton Hotel in Towson, Maryland, a Baltimore suburb.
The family was from Garden City, New York, but Stephanie Parente was a student at Loyola College in Baltimore, and police said the family visited her there occasionally.
The bodies of Betty Parente and the two daughters were found on a king-size bed in the hotel room, while William Parente's body was found in the bathroom, police said.
There was no evidence they were restrained, Johnson said.
Loyola College spokeswoman Courtney Jolley said Stephanie Parente was a sophomore majoring in speech-language pathology with a natural-sciences minor.
"There's a safety net in place," he said.
