Among rescue workers, the asthma risk was highest for those who worked on the pile on September 11.
"But immediately after the 9/11 event, I don't think there was a clear understanding of what the physical impacts would be."
People in the vicinity of the collapse had "the potential to inhale huge amounts of particulate matter," observes Joan Reibman, M.D., an associate professor of medicine and environmental medicine at the New York University School of Medicine and the director of the school's Bellevue Asthma Center, who was not involved in the study.
More than 71,000 rescue and recovery workers, lower Manhattan office workers, nearby residents, and passers-by enrolled in the registry.
Among rescue and recovery workers, for example, the asthma risk was highest for those who worked on the pile on September 11.
"It shows that people who had heavy dust exposure in the initial period, that this was a risk to developing asthma but not the only risk," says Reibman, who also serves as the director of New York City's World Trade Center Environmental Health Center, one of three centers dedicated to treating September 11-related conditions.
