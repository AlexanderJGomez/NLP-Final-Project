A man claiming to be Abubakar Shekau made the comments in a video posted online on Saturday, saying the group attacked a bus station in retaliation for the what he described as the government's collusion with the United States in the killing of Muslims.
A total of 45 girls are now free, according to a statement from Borno State Education Commissioner Musa Inuwa Kulo.
Under Shekau, who took control of the group in 2009, violence carried out by the group has flourished, according to authorities.
He uses the alias Darul Tawheed, and analysts describe him as a ruthless loner and master of disguise.
