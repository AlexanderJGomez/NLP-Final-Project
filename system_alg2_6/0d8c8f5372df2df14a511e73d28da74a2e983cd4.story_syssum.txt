But even though I take steps to keep my old electronics out of landfills and environmentally disastrous overseas disposal doesn't mean I'm willing to spend large amounts of time and effort to figure out what to do with them.
(Cult of Mac, Wall Street Journal and many other venues are reporting the same problem.)
So I found a middleman to shield me from embarassment, keep my old iPhone out of the landfill and let me make some easy money all at the same time.
My time is worth money.
Frankly, if I had to deal with the hassles and risks of selling this phone myself via Craigslist or eBay, and also reverting it back to an older OS so it's bearably functional again to assuage my conscience, that iPhone would keep sitting on my dresser until the next electronics recycling drive.
"There tends to be a large secondary market for their used devices, which normally aren't very old."
The Gazelle.com site did not ask me which operating system is on my iPhone 3G.
"As phones become more like computers, we might start to pay closer attention to that."
