On Friday, it will be a shopping mall, once again.
Yuille died of a single shot to the back, and Forsyth of one shot to his head, Oregon Deputy Medical Examiner Chris Young said Thursday in a news release.
"Never could I imagine him being part of something like this," Tami Roberts, his biological aunt -- though she referred to herself as his mother -- told CNN affiliate KPTV.
Roberts planned to "be a hero" and join the Marines, Tami Roberts said.
"Every day of my whole life, I was proud of him," she said.
In its post announcing stores will reopen Friday, Clackamas Town Center stressed it won't forget all those affected by the violence -- from Yuille, Forsyth and Shevchenko to the scores of others who saw their holiday shopping devolve into chaos.
