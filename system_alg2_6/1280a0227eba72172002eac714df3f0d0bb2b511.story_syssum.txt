The profile photo on what appears to be his Facebook page, last updated in January 2013, shows him with his tongue wagging, his hand tattooed, with a ballcap on his head and thick chain around his neck.
It's not clear how any of his past led to Nowsch's arrest Thursday, one week after his neighbor Tammy Meyers was shot.
"We knew how bad he was," Robert Meyers told reporters.
But they believe it was Nowsch who shot Tammy Meyers soon after she'd gotten out of her car outside her Las Vegas home, about a block from his own home.
Robert Meyers told HLN's Nancy Grace that the man threatened to kill his wife and daughter.
That was the extent of what authorities knew about the back-and-forth between Nowsch and Tammy Meyers until Thursday, according to Las Vegas police Capt.
It was then that Robert Meyers first told reporters that Nowsch and his wife had known each other for some time.
