Reyhanli, Turkey (CNN) -- Protesters in a Turkish border town hit by a twin car-bombing a week ago clashed with police Saturday, as they voiced anger over the government's response to the attack.
Police prevented the protesters from reaching the site of the blasts in the center of the town, which lies in Turkey's southern Hatay province.
Erdogan has held talks with U.S. President Barack Obama and other U.S. officials in Washington.
Celalettin Lekesiz, governor of Hatay province, said Saturday that security forces had detained 17 people so far in connection with the bomb attacks and are hunting for four others, the semi-official Anadolu news agency reported.
