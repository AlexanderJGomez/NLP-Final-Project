New York (CNN) -- Jorge Munoz is a bus driver in New York City who started feeding the hungry in Queens five years ago, using food that would otherwise have been thrown away.
Here is an edited transcript.
So I called my mom and I said I had people to give the food to.
What do you provide for people?
But every day we make 120 to 140 meals.
Munoz: Because I have a family at my house and I have a second family out there.
Munoz: To become a CNN Hero, being nominated, it's a great honor for me, for my family and for my country [Colombia].
So they know -- I had the chance to be there for almost a month and when I went into a neighborhood and people knew, or even here in New York, people recognize me.
Munoz: That was a great honor.
Munoz: If you share, share anything you have you're not using like clothes, toys, share it to make other people happy.
Share.
So share, it's a beautiful thing.
