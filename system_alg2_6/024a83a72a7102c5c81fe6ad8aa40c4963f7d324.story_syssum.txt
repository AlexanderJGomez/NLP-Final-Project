Hong Kong (CNN) -- As the attention of the rugby world is drawn to Hong Kong this weekend for the Rugby Sevens, corporations are looking to capitalize on a sport that soon will become an Olympic event.
But is the right place the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens?
But while HSBC has ramped up its sponsorship investment in Hong Kong, the "world's local bank" is winding down some of its Asian retail operations -- notably in Japan and Thailand, while cutting 30,000 workers worldwide by the end of next year.
And it has grown.
In Hong Kong, there's only one Rugby Sevens Championship.
HSBC is sharing title sponsorship of the Rugby Sevens with Cathay Pacific, whose global hub is Hong Kong.
Cathay has been investing in the Hong Kong Sevens for much of the last 35 years.
Companies are counting that as thousands descend on the city, more spectators may notice that DHL ad on the Jumbotron in Hong Kong's Central bar district, notice the Cathay Pacific billboard streak by on a Citybus, or notice that red-and-white HSBC banner flutter in the Sevens stadium breeze.
