When Cobb received the DNA results, he wrote it off.
Well, apparently we aren't talking oil and water, are we Mr. Cobb?
If you were white, you were free; if you were black, you were enslaved.
They needed to maintain a firm color line.
What that means, then, is that 30% of the folks who call themselves white have much more than one drop, including white supremacist Craig Cobb.
Although the "one-drop rule" in many ways serves foundational to black American racial identity, and has functioned to draw borders around the black community as we know it, one drop of "blackness" -- whatever that is -- does not constitute black identity.
So, while I was thoroughly amused by the sight of Craig Cobb's face when he learned that he, too, is "of African descent," I am clear that those DNA test results do not magically make him black; no number of drops ever could.
