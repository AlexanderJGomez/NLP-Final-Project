Hannah was born with the neuromuscular disease arthrogryposis, which makes her joints curve and muscles extremely weak.
She began using a device the hospital designed, called the "WREX" -- robotic arms made from 3-D printing.
It's a life-changing device, and one that's benefitted hugely from 3-D printing.
"We can print a full set of plastic parts for one pair of WREXs for one patient overnight, and by the end of the next work day we can clean the parts and have the WREX fully assembled," says Sample, adding that metal components must also be made by traditional methods prior to assembly.
We don't know quite how might it be controlled, but we see that that is the future of the WREX."
"Her elbows are typically stuck at her sides and that's where she's been limited to raising her arms and reaching for things.
As sassy as she is and as much as she likes to be in charge, she might run for president someday -- who knows?
