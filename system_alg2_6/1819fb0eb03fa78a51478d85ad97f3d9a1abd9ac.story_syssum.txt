But a new line of Harry Potter stamps released this week by the U.S.
First off, can a fictitious teenage wizard ever become a U.S. citizen?
But the "American experience" is not just colored by U.S. citizens.
Why?
Rather, it's because stamp purists are dismayed by the increasing commercialization of U.S. postage stamps.
So I say it's time for the Postal Service to roll out stamps that will make money.
