(CNN) -- The future residents of a new Spanish neighborhood say they are the first in the world to name their street after the Super Mario video game character.
The government-sponsored Arcosur project aims to build more than 21,000 residences for people ages 20 to 35 who are buying their first homes, he said.
Super Mario's street is nearly a kilometer long and will have hundreds of homes on it, Almudi said -- and his will be one of them.
Once it's constructed, more than 60,000 people are expected to live in the neighborhood, Almudi said.
"Surely we have a lot of plumbers."
