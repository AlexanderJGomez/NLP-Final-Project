Iranian President Hassan Rouhani acknowledged the meeting between him and British Prime Minister David Cameron with a tweet -- picture included -- from the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Then again, Cameron added, "Iran's leaders could help in defeating the threat from ISIL," using a commonly used acronym for ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State.
Gen. Amir-Ali Hajizadeh even said that members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard "stopped" ISIS from entering the Kurdish city of Irbil, according to a report Wednesday from state-run Press TV.
Rouhani on Wednesday criticized the coalition airstrikes in Syria, saying they do not have "any legal standing" because U.N. members haven't sanctioned them.
