"In Germany we have a situation now where Dortmund and Bayern are far, far more away from the other teams, and that's what we don't want to see in the Bundesliga," said Ballack, who has 98 Germany caps to his name.
"These last years we could see a lot of surprises, and from the bottom (a team) could beat the first one.
"It is just Bayern Munich who has this good position, and from a financial point really good, and really healthy.
But if you see this Bayern Munich team now, I can't really see where he needs to change.
"But on the other side, like I said, you can't really change a lot because everything works well.
And Ballack, who won one Premier League title and two FA Cups in his four years at Chelsea, and three Bundesliga crowns with Bayern, says his time with Mourinho was a golden spell in his career.
What we have as players, is another picture.
And that shows not just in Chelsea, he also adapted really well on the international (stage).
