The men, who died Tuesday, are the first two Americans killed in Iraq since the United States ended its combat role there after seven years.
Ironically, Jenkins and McClamrock were killed by an Iraqi soldier.
The bodies of Jenkins and McClamrock arrived at Dover on a cool, clear night, along with the bodies of two Marines killed in Afghanistan.
