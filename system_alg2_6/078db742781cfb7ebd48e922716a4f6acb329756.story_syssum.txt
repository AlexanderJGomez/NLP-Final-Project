Their protest signs -- "Save Blair Mountain" and "Abolish Mountaintop Removal" -- poke through the leaves.
The 50-mile march is re-creating the 1921 March on Blair that led to a bloody battle between thousands of coal miners and coal company supporters.
"If you stand for preserving our cultural heritage instead of destroying it, you stand for Blair Mountain," Chuck Keeney said to his followers before he led marchers out of Marmet, West Virginia, last week.
"Why don't they get a job, instead of taking ours," one young coal miner watching from his porch asks.
"I just don't want to see coal mining that destroys rivers, drives away the biodiversity of such a beautiful place and also drives away other jobs that could be in place of coal mining."
He lost his job when the coal company near his home was denied a mountaintop removal mining permit by the Environmental Protection Agency.
"Welcome to Coal Country" says a sign greeting the marchers as they cross the Logan County line.
We have met with Kish before and visited a mountaintop removal site with her.
We just told them to go home or leave our state alone.
One of the speakers is Robert Kennedy Jr., an environmental activist and son of the late Sen. Robert Kennedy.
The new "March on Blair Mountain" ends in song and celebration at the top of the mountain.
March organizer Chuck Keeney sums up the march as a success for raising awareness, but wants to do more to make sure there is no mountaintop mining of Blair.
