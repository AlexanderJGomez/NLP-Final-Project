(CNN)Incumbent Goodluck Jonathan phoned former military leader Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday to concede defeat in Nigeria's presidential elections, Buhari's party says.
"There's been so much violence in Rivers state that it's just not tenable," party spokesman Lai Mohammed said.
In his statement Tuesday, Jonathan said; "I promised the country free and fair elections.
"As I have always affirmed, nobody's ambition is worth the blood of any Nigerian.
Jonathan has been criticized for not doing enough to combat Boko Haram, which is waging a campaign of terror aimed at instituting a stricter version of Sharia law in Nigeria.
