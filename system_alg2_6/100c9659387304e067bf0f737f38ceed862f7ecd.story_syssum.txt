"After five years of Hamas rule in Gaza, its criminal justice system reeks of injustice, routinely violates detainees' rights, and grants impunity to abusive security services," Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director for Human Rights Watch, said in an online posting Wednesday.
Abdel Karim Shrair, for example, was charged with collaborating with Israel, the report said.
"There is ample evidence that Hamas security services are torturing people in custody with impunity and denying prisoners their rights," Stork said.
