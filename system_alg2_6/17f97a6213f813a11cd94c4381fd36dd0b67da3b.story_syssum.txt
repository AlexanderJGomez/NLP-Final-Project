Washington (CNN) -- The justices on the Supreme Court know very well their rulings can send immediate political shock waves, and those just intensify in a presidential election year.
The 2000 Bush v. Gore case ultimately settled the fight over counting Florida's ballots, giving George W. Bush the presidency.
The new president in fact had asked the court to time its decision until after the election but before being sworn into office.
Historians also note the president-elect had quietly persuaded Northern Justice Robert Grier to change his vote and join the Southern majority in the Scott case, to give the impression the decision was not made along regional lines.
The justices said that did not violate federal authority over interstate commerce, nor the 13th and 14th amendments.
The companion cases first came to the court in 1970, and arguments were scheduled for 1971, then postponed until spring 1972, then reargued October 1972, a month before the presidential elections.
Stopping the tally meant Republican George W. Bush, who was then narrowly leading in the decisive state, would become president, defeating Vice President Al Gore.
Here are some presidential election years where the Supreme Court as an institution or the justices became a major campaign issue:
In 1876, Democrat Samuel Tilden won the popular vote in the presidential race, with Republican Rutherford B. Hayes also trailing in the initial electoral vote.
It would give Congress the power to overturn Supreme Court decisions that overturned acts of Congress.

Warren retired a year later, and Nixon eventually named four justices to the high court.
