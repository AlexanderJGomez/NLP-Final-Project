Players can use up to eight different characters on each level during story mode, but that can lead to a crowded screen.
Ellison said the settings are as iconic as they could be and the team tried to put the LEGO spin on the movies.
Since the films' characters are so well known, he said the team wanted to make sure to include little details to help players relate to each character.
Said Ellison: "The exploration game play ties into the ideology of 'Pirates of the Caribbean.'
Ellison said each scene has to be solvable for all ages, and the game teaches you what to do and where to look as it goes along.
Plus we took the same slapstick humor from the films and just made more of it."
Unlike previous LEGO games, which forced the two characters to stay in the same screenshot, "LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean" actually splits the screen as the characters walk away from each other.
Once each level is completed in story mode, free play mode is unlocked, allowing you to use any of the characters you have available to solve puzzles that couldn't be previously figured out.
The game is also available for the Nintendo 3DS, but there are only 16 levels, and you can use only one character during each level.
I mean, Captain Jack Sparrow ... is worthy of any would-be pirate.
This review was done playing on the Xbox 360 in story mode, co-op mode and free play.
