Ahmad Majidi, the head of the special working group investigating the Caspian Airlines crash, also said a Russian team had arrived in Iran to help study the crash of the Russian-made plane, Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting said.
Fragments of the plane are also being examined to help determine the cause of the crash, Majidi said.
