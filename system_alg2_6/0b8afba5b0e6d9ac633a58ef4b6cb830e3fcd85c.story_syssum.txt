(CNN)The idea of sustainable development is that raw capitalism is far too powerful for its own good.
After all, the world economy has expanded at least 100-fold since modern industrial capitalism first found its footing in Britain around 1800, and for most of the world, living standards have risen markedly along the way.
Sustainable development is a doctrine that says: Let us once again place the economy on a true moral foundation and we'll keep greed within bounds, ensuring the economic growth is combined with social fairness and environmental sustainability.
The idea of sustainable development is that an economy must satisfy all three principles: economic growth, social fairness and environmental sustainability.
Thus, sustainable development calls for a holistic approach that combines economic, social, and environmental objectives.
In my new book, The Age of Sustainable Development, IÂ¹ve not only analyzed the trends of growing inequality and rising environmental destruction, but have also shown how the concepts of sustainable development can be used to chart a way out of our growing crisis.
If the world takes the time to do its homework and plan for the future, the world can bring the climate crisis under control and still enjoy a growing supply of quality energy services.
These new SDGs will become markers and guideposts for building a world that combines prosperity, fairness, and environmental sanity -- a world we truly want and need for ourselves and our children.
