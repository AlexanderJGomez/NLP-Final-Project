Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected an appeal from a North Carolina county that had regularly opened its public meetings with Christian prayers.
Court records show that 26 of 33 invocations given at the council meetings in 2007 and 2008 contained references to Jesus Christ, the Trinity, or other Christian symbols or names.
The case is Forsyth County, N.C., v. Joyner (11-546).
Court records show the posting was widely circulated at the school among students and faculty, and the principal eventually suspended the girl for 10 days.
Kowalski sued after she was cited for violating the county school policy on bullying and harassment.
"Now is the time for the Supreme Court to resolve the question of whether and to what extent school districts have the authority to discipline students for off-campus speech," said Francisco Negron Jr., of the National School Boards Association.
The current cases are Blue Mountain School District v. J.S.
