McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton has an outside chance of claiming his second crown, being 24 points behind Alonso with only 25 on offer to the winner.
"I don't think I would lose even one second of my energy this weekend thinking of what is going to happen on Sunday afternoon," the 29-year-old told F1's official website when asked whether he would understand if Vettel assisted Webber.
That's the target and I think that's what we're going to achieve this weekend.
"I know that I've been very fortunate even to have a chance to get to this point," the 34-year-old said.
Obviously I have to win this race.
