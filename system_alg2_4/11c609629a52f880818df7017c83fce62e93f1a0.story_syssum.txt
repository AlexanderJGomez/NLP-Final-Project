New York (CNN) -- Alleged drug kingpin Christopher "Dudus" Coke, who was extradited to the United States from Jamaica, pleaded not guilty to drug and weapons charges in a New York courtroom Friday.
The court-assigned attorney told the judge he has not been permanently assigned to case because the Coke family hired attorneys Frank Doddato and Steven Rosen.
"I love the people of Jamaica," he said in response to a question from a Jamaican reporter.
"At Coke's direction and under his protection, members of his criminal organization sold marijuana and crack cocaine in the New York area and elsewhere, and sent the narcotics proceeds back to Coke and his co-conspirators," the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York said in a news release.
He would face a maximum sentence of five years in prison on the firearms trafficking charge and a fine of up to $250,000.
