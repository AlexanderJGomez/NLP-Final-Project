Kaufman, Texas (CNN) -- A Texas community is on edge after a district attorney who said he would put away the "scum" who killed a colleague two months ago was shot to death alongside his wife in his home Saturday night.
"I can't say that," Kaufman County Sheriff David Byrnes told reporters.
Just two months ago, McLelland vowed to find the people who killed Hasse, one of his top deputies.
"He never stated to me that he was worried," Wood said.
A law enforcement source told CNN that investigators at the McLellands' home recovered several shell casings at the scene of the crime.
McLelland was an Army veteran who later earned a master's degree in psychology and became a psychologist for the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation, the district attorney's website said.
He later earned his law degree and practiced as a defense attorney and mental health judge for 18 years before becoming the county's district attorney in 2010.
She said the prosecutor told her he had begun carrying a gun in and out of the county courthouse daily.
McLelland called Hasse "a stellar prosecutor" who knew that threats were part of the job.
"I hope that the people that did this are watching, because we're very confident that we're going to find you," McLelland told reporters.
Schulte told the station that after someone shot through the windows of his Dallas offices in November, he began to carry a gun more often.
