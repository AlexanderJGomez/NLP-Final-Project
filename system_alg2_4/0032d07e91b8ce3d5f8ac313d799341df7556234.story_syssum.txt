(Tribune Media Services) -- When Eileen Mather lands in Mexico City on her way to Tapachula, Mexico, she learns her airline ticket isn't valid.
So I had to buy new tickets.
After I returned home, I faxed all of my documents to a supervisor at Cheapoair.
A: You shouldn't have to pay twice for your airline tickets.
Reservations can be lost, paper tickets and boarding passes can be misread.
The online agency shouldn't have kept you in a holding pattern for more than six months.
You could have avoided a lengthy dance with Cheapoair by taking this up with Aviacsa either when you were flying to Tapachula or returning home.
Normally, starting a new query through an online form means your complaint will get reviewed again and may be assigned a new case number.
An airline representative told Cheapoair it would have to speak to the agent who was working at the ticket counter when you checked in, which was impossible.
