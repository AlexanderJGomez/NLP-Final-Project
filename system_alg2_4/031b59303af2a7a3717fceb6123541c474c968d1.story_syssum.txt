Philip Seymour Hoffman was an actor who could be anybody.
...
Hoffman was found dead Sunday.
For years, Hoffman was the kind of anonymous character actor who earned critical raves but was often unnoticed by the general public.
"One of the finest actors of his generation," he wrote in his review of the 2012 staging of "Death of a Salesman" -- even while finding Hoffman miscast in that production.
Character actors -- and Hoffman, for all his intensity, was a character actor -- support movie stars.
In some respects he followed the path of one of his heroes, Paul Newman, who had looks and magnetism to burn but wasn't shy about taking "character" parts, such as a broken-down lawyer in "The Verdict" or a ne'er-do-well in "Nobody's Fool."
He also kept his talent sharp with frequent stage work and the kind of "one for me, one for them" movie philosophy that made sure he was both busy and successful.
He was a New York-based actor, not a movie star.
If I talk about them in the press, I'm giving them no choice.
"We have lost a true artist," said Robin Wright in a statement.
But perhaps director Nichols was most succinct -- and heartfelt -- in describing the void left by Hoffman's death.
"For me, acting is torturous, and it's torturous because you know it's a beautiful thing," he said.
