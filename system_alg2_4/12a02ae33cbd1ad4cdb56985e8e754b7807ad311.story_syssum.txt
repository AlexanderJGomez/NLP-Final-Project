Despite being unable to replicate the form he showed prior to his first retirement, Schumacher said he is still hungry for success as he prepares for a 19th season in the elite division of motorsport.
"I have done quite a few roll-outs and launches of new cars, but even after all these years I must say it still feels special," Schumacher, who won two championships with Benetton in 1994 and 1995 and five with Ferrari between 2000 and 2004, told the sport's official website.
For my part, I am eager to fight again, looking forward to the new season, and I can't wait for it to begin."
"We have had a good start to our 2012 testing program, and it was a great feeling to drive the first laps in the new F1 W03," the 26-year-old said.
