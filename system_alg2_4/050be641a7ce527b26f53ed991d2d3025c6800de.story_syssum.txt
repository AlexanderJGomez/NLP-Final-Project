"Before the bridge, there [were] so many people, so many who lost their lives," said Kakuko, 32.
"I've worked all over Kenya," said Parker, 54.
When Parker arrived in Kenya as a young missionary, he befriended Jay Hindson, a fellow development worker who introduced him to a bridge build in 1996.
The organization oversees the building of bridges that not only save lives but connect isolated villagers to resources that can improve their way of life.
Since 1997, Parker has helped build 45 bridges in Kenya.

They are built using basic materials and local tools so villagers can maintain them and make repairs when needed.
Parker also requires that the community demonstrate a willingness and ability to participate in the construction of the bridge, whether it's by gathering sand, making gravel or digging foundations.
"It is good for us, because this is our bridge," he said.
Although the bridges are sponsored by donors, villagers are also expected to provide some form of financial contribution.
But they always give me a goat," Parker said.
"A bridge is a beautiful metaphor for many things.
There are bridges of hope, bridges of peace, bridges of life.
