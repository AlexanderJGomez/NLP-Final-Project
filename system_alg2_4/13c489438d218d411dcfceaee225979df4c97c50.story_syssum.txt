Police investigate the vehicle destroyed by a car bomb in Spain's Basque region.
The Spanish national police officer killed was Eduardo Puelles, said the new Basque regional president, Patxi Lopez.
The officer was a senior figure in the fight against ETA and the explosion was caused by a limpet bomb placed underneath the car, officials told CNN partner station CNN+.
The European Union and the United States list it as a terrorist group.
ETA has threatened Lopez, who is a socialist and the first non-nationalist Basque president in 30 years.
