Department of Agriculture will provide scientific knowledge to help farmers, ranchers and landowners battle risks associated with climate change, including drought, floods, pests and fires.
"USDA's climate hubs are part of our broad commitment to developing the next generation of climate solutions so that our agricultural leaders have the modern technologies and tools they need to adapt and succeed in the face of a changing climate," Vilsack said.
Climate hubs will focus on regional issues, and will equip local communities with knowledge to help them adapt.
The hubs are part of a broader commitment by President Barack Obama to make climate change a priority.
Vilsack will introduce the hubs at the White House on Wednesday.
