M+, a state of the art "visual culture" museum due to open in 2017 has already acquired two classic 1970s neon logos -- one depicting a red rooster and the other a large cow.
"It was a no-brainer for us to collect neon signs," he says.
To drum up interest in its new acquisition, M+ is holding an online exhibition of Hong Kong's neon signs.
"Neon signage is a highly under-researched topic," says Chen.
One reason is a government crackdown on illegal and unsafe structures that in 2009 led to the removal of about 5,000 signboards, many of them neon.
The neon cow that will enter the M+ collection was deemed unfit as, at 4.5 meters wide, it busts official size limits.
Yau, a curator for Hong Kong's Heritage Museum before taking up post at the URA, is sorry to see the cow go, but says: "Life has to move on.
A push from mainland China to use LEDs has also dimmed Hong Kong's love of neon.
"Many cities in China no longer support neon signage and this inevitably affects Hong Kong's businesses," says Tam.
In terms of quantity, neon will recede.
