Gene Seymour says we want to relive Michael Jackson's youth, not the sad and bizarre aspects of his later life.
As with most things you neither expected nor wanted to hear, you thought that there had to be more to it than what was being said.
Even if we didn't care for this conversation, we had been conditioned by the most recent events to wonder, deep down, if there was something stranger or more unpleasant attached to his passing.
Let us see that transfiguring moment 15 years later at the Motown Anniversary TV special when Jackson seized dominion over the pop firmament with his shattering, moon-walking recital of "Billie Jean."
Maybe, much later.
As surely as he was the King of Pop, Jackson was also a high priest of wish fulfillment.
But it's when that promise expands to shatter boundaries and expand possibilities beyond Top-40 parameters that pop music becomes pop phenomena.
Jackson's off-stage public diffidence gave the impression that his transformations of both self and society were all happening by off-hand magic.
Or why he wanted to both save the world and hide from it with the same ferocious intensity.
If he'd been able to stop the clock at 1985 or even 1987 (the year of "Bad"), life would have been so much easier.
However divided (or worse) we may have felt about Michael Jackson at the end, we cherish how he brought out the best in us at the beginning.
