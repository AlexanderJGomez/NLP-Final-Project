Geoffrey Portway pleaded guilty in May to distribution and possession of child pornography and solicitation to commit a crime of violence, according to court documents.
Portway went by the moniker "Fat Longpig" during his online chats, according to court documents.
Authorities also found a locked basement, court documents show.
It was furnished with a metal cage with a circular hole for feeding, a rusted and worn steel-topped table, as well as multiple kinds of metal bondage equipment.
A lot of the chats that he had were, in his mind, fantasy," Sweeney said.
Photographs reviewed by CNN show handcuffs, rope intended for bondage, mouth gags, and castration tools.
