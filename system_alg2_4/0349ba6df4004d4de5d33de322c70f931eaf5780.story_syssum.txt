And now -- due in part to the abundance of social media and the intense interest in Spider-Man's alter ego, Peter Parker -- a firestorm has erupted, after Marvel revealed that Parker will die, and the role of Spider-Man will be taken over by his archenemy, Doctor Octopus.
The just-released "Amazing Spider-Man" #700 marks the end of one of the most popular comic book series of all time after 50 years.
When issue #700 was leaked early, fan reaction -- both positive and negative -- went into overdrive, with a few death threats directed at the issue's writer, Dan Slott.
CNN spoke separately to Slott and to Marvel editor Stephen Wacker about the controversial comic.
If Peter had never learned the lesson of "great power and great responsibility," there's every chance he would have become a supervillain.
So what if we flipped it?
It wasn't originally going to be in the 700th issue, but as the story grew, we realized maybe it was time to change up the makeup of Spider-Man for good, to make a permanent change.
With that and the fact that the 50th anniversary was approaching, we thought, let's go out with a bang.
Wacker: The fan reaction never really surprises me.
You find people of all stripes reacting -- people who have been reading it for 50 years and love it, and others who say they're quitting Marvel forever.
There are not a lot of storytelling opportunities in the world where you get such an immediate, visceral reaction.
I got an angry tweet saying, "I don't like seeing bad things happen to good people."
Now people are saying, "Nooooo!
In the world of comics, thanks to (newspaper publisher) J. Jonah Jameson, everyone thinks he's a menace.
Now we're going to flip that too.
And going from everything I've seen on social media, I am so up for that challenge!
