(CNN) -- People in poorer countries send text messages more often than those in wealthier countries.
In almost all the countries surveyed, the use of social networks such as Facebook and Twitter didn't change much from 2010 to 2011.
The Pew survey found that only 6% of Internet users in Russia were not on social-networking sites.
-- Of the countries surveyed, text messaging was most common in Indonesia and Kenya, where 96% and 89% of people said they regularly send texts.
For example, 53% of respondents in Israel and 50% of respondents in the U.S. said they use social networks, compared with 5% in India and 2% in Pakistan.
