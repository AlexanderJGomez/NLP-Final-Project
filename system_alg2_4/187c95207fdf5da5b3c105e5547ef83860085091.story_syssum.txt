Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- Hundreds of people fled a pro-Alassane Ouattara neighborhood in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, where forces loyal to incumbent President Laurent Gbabgbo have been fighting an armed Ouattara supporters for the past week.
The violence rose sharply mid-week after a mission of four African heads of state, mandated by the African Union to find a "binding solution" to the Ivorian post electoral crisis, left Abidjan.
Ouattara is holed up in the Golf hotel in Abidjan under the protection of U.N. peacekeepers.
In his Friday statement, Ban reiterated his call on both sides to exercise maximum restraint and to extend their cooperation to the African Union High-Level Panel.
Army spokesman Col. Babri Gohourou said on national television that the police officer went to the U.N. camp to negotiate the release of three Gbagbo supporters who were arrested during a demonstration.
The political standoff in the country has raised fears of a renewal of the bloodshed suffered after a civil war broke out in 2002.
