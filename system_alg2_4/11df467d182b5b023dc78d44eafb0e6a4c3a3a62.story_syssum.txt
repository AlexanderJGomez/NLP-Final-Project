(CNN) -- Here's what Katie Roche expected when she went into the hospital for spine surgery: two titanium rods, a bone graft, 17 screws in her vertebrae, eight hours in the operating room, and a week's stay in the hospital to recover.
The bacterium that made her so sick is called Clostridium difficile, and according to a study out this week, it's more common than ever among hospitalized children in the United States, and children who get it are more likely to die or require surgery.
What's really disturbing, he says, is that these children didn't have to get sick.
Her mother called the doctor, and he told her to bring Katie back to the hospital.
Doctors found Katie had an infection -- not C. diff, but another bacterium -- and did a surgery to clear it up.
"I was throwing up all the time, and was so weak that one day I just blacked out in my hospital bed," she remembers.
Three years ago, the hospital had 5.3 C. diff infections for every 1,000 hospital admissions, and in the past three years it's had none at all, according to Dr. Alfonso Torress-Cook, epidemiologist for the hospital.

The Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths has more information on how routine cleaning by hospital staff might not be enough to control C. diff.

"There should be no difference whatsoever between precautions for the parents and precautions for the staff," Pronovost says.
"As a parent I know we worry we're going to piss off the doctor if we ask too many questions," he says.
