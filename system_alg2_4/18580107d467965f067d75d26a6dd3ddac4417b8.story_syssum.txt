(Mashable)  -- UPDATE We've just heard from the NHL, who tell us: "The NHL is not in discussions with YouTube to stream live games.
Gautam Anand, Google's director of content partnerships for Asia Pacific, recently said that YouTube plans to show more live sports, but declined to elaborate on the particulars of talks with the NBA and NHL.
Just the other week, it was rumored that YouTube CEO Salar Kamangar will be building out the site's recently instated talent program (last July, the video-sharing site announced its YouTube Partner Grants Program to ramp up quality content) by offering big-name stars their own YouTube channels.
What do you think of the prospect of watching live games on YouTube?
