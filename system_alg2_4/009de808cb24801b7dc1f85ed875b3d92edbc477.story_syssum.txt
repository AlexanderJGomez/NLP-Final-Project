And more than half of those attacks were carried out by suspected Somali pirates, an international maritime watchdog group said Wednesday.
Of the incidents this year, Somali pirates accounted for 54 percent: they launched 168 attacks.
Somali pirates are still holding four ships for ransom with 80 crew members as hostages.
But because of the presence of naval vessels, the success rate of the pirates have decreased," Mody said.
They don night-vision goggles, carry rocket launchers and navigate with global positioning devices.
As global commerce picks up, more and more of the world's fuels, minerals and other crucial commodities travel by ship.
Those who have tracked pirate activity say it started in Somalia in the 1980s, when the pirates claimed they were aiming to stop the rampant illegal fishing and dumping that continues to this day off the Somali coast.
That's a fortune for someone from an impoverished country.
Other trouble spots this year were waters off Nigeria, with 20 attacks; Malaysia with 14; and Bangladesh with 12.
