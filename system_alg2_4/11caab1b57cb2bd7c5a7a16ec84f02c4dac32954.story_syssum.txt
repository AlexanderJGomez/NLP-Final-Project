Panetta's assessment came just days before the one-year anniversary of the U.S. commando raid on bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, that ended a manhunt for the al Qaeda founder that began following the September 11, 2001, terror attacks.
There is no specific, credible terror threat, the agencies said.
Panetta recalled the moment during the raid when one of two helicopters used by Navy SEALs crashed at bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.
But all of us were, were kind of holding our breath to find out whether or not he was actually there."
Panetta has said he remains convinced that someone with authority in Pakistan knew bin Laden was hiding at the compound.
Pakistan has in essence halted much of its cooperation with the United States while its parliament reassess future terms of engagement with Washington following a U.S. airstrike in November that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers along the border with Afghanistan.
