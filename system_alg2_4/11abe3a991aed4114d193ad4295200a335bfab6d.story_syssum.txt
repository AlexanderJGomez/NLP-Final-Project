He also is accused of harming state security because of what he said during the meeting, Oureto said.
His arrest follows that of two former Gbagbo Cabinet ministers, one of them in Ghana, where he had sought refuge.
At least 17 people were killed in the attacks, including 10 Ivorian soldiers.
Ivory Coast's authorities say Gbagbo's supporters are behind the attacks, intended to destabilize the West African country, which is recovering from a five-month post-election crisis that killed more than 3,000 people last year.
Gbagbo was arrested in April 2011, after 10 days of war, in Abidjan.
Alphonse Douati, a senior member of the party and former Cabinet minister in Gbagbo's administration, was arrested last Tuesday and has been charged with harming state security.
Ivory Coast's government issued international arrest warrants last year against two dozen military and political officials loyal to Gbagbo, including Katinan, who is accused of economic crimes.
