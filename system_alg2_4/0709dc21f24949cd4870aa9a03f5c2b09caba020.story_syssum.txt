Washington (CNN) -- The unsolved murder of human rights activists in Russia.
Declines in freedom around the world outweighed gains last year, for the fourth year in a row, Freedom House says in its annual survey published Tuesday.
"Governments are more likely to permit relatively honest elections than to allow an uncensored press, a robust civil society, and an independent judiciary," Puddington writes.
But much of the former Soviet Union is in a dire state.
Central Asia is the least free region in the world, according to Freedom House, and contains two of the nine countries that got the survey's "worst of the worst" rating.
Freedom House groups countries into three categories: free, partly free and not free.
China is home to more than half the people in the "not free" category, Freedom House said.
It has been publishing its annual report since 1972.
