(CNN) -- An Ohio appeals court Wednesday overturned hate-crime convictions of 16 Amish men and women in connection with a spate of beard- and hair-cutting attacks on members of their faith, according to court documents.
Prosecutors said Mullet's followers, at his instruction, shaved the beards and cut the hair of Amish people who had left his group over various religious disagreements.
Four of his followers were sentenced to seven years, three received five-year sentences, two were sentenced to two years and six were sentenced to a year and a day, according to the Justice department.
The jury also had convicted various defendants with separate assaults, and Mullet with concealing or attempting to conceal evidence, including a camera and pictures of the attacks, the U.S. attorney's office said.
"We respectfully disagree with the two judges who reversed the defendants' hate crime convictions based on a jury instruction," the statement said.
