She said she thought she was going to die as her car crashed into the concrete and plunged into the water.
I thought I was going to sink with my car," she said from her hospital bed Friday, her left shoulder bearing the bruised imprint of a seatbelt.
"It's still hard for me to believe that I took that fall, I went through all that ... but I'm here, and that, to me, is just amazing," she said.
Patterson said she heard a loud explosion and turned around, thinking it was construction or dynamite testing.
More than 100 people were injured Wednesday when the Interstate 35W bridge collapsed into the Mississippi River.
The woman's car was found at the disaster site, but she was not.
The Minneapolis Fire Department recovered the fifth body from the bridge decking, he said.
At least 100 people have come to hospitals with injuries, said Dr. John Hick of the Hennepin County Medical Center.
Friday morning's recovery effort went more smoothly than anticipated, Stanek said.
Stanek said National Transportation Safety Board investigators had told him that 60 vehicles were visible at the collapse site.
"When you go over there, it's quite heart-wrenching," he said Friday morning.
"If there's anything good about it, maybe we can look at other bridges."
President Bush, who on Thursday pledged federal aid to rebuild the bridge, will visit the disaster site Saturday.
