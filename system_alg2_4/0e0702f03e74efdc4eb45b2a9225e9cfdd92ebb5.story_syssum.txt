Some DNA samples on subway surfaces matched no known organisms studied before, while others were fragments associated with anthrax and the bubonic plague.
Scientists chose the New York City subway system because it is the largest in the world by station count and transports 5.5 million people per day, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
After sequencing samples were picked up at subway stations, researchers determined that nearly half did "not match any known organism" -- a fact that underscores "the vast wealth of unknown species that are ubiquitous in urban areas," the report said.
Even though researchers picked up elements deemed "infectious agents" by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, such as anthrax and the bubonic plague, subway users are not at risk, the report said.
"The subway, in general, is primarily a safe surface," the report said.
One subway station in particular yielded fascinating results.
The organisms "mirror bacteria that are more commonly associated with fish species, marine environments, or very cold Antarctic environments; yet these species are still distinct from" others sampled from the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn, which was also studied in this report.
Researchers studied samples that could be analyzed with "ancestry-informative markers" and then compared the results to a map of a demographic community compiled from the 2010 census.
There was also an increase in Han Chinese and Japanese indicators at the subway station that matched an area adjacent to the station, according to census data.
In the immediate future, however, Mason and his team believe their study is a "first step" towards protecting the health of New Yorkers -- and could be the basis for a "smart city" where leaders use the data to improve city planning as well as management of mass transit and human health.
