Only 5% of Weibo users generate original posts, while the rest of the Chinese micro-blogging world just re-posts from them, according to research by Fu King-wa from the University of Hong Kong.
The IPO launch sparks discussions on the company's worth.
That year was also when Fu began analyzing the usage pattern of Weibo's registered accounts.
In March 2013, Fu had looked at nearly 30,000 Weibo accounts.
In contrast, Weibo claims it has 130 million active users but does not say whether these users post original content.
However, Fu argued his study is a better reflection of user activity.
I think this is a much better way to indicate social media usage in the Web 2.0 era."
"Research has consistently shown that active, original contributors constitute a tiny proportion, typically 1-2%, of any Internet service.
He explained that active and original participation on the Internet by ordinary users has always been low because people do not primarily go on to these platforms to create content.
Thus the costs far outweigh the benefits, unless you're passionate enough to write or create something original, you'll realize that it's much better to re-post something already out there," said Yeo.
Doug Young, author of "The Party Line," an in-depth look at Chinese media says that even though he is a user of the micro-blogging service, he won't be investing in Weibo because "there is the sense that Weibo has passed its prime.
I don't see how they have done much to innovate beyond knocking off Twitter."
