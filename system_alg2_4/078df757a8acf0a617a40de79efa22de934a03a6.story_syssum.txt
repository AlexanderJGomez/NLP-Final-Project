L'AQUILA, Italy (CNN) -- Leaders of both industrialized powers and emerging economies have agreed to work together on setting a goal to limit global warming to levels recommended by scientists, U.S. President Barack Obama said at the G-8 summit.
"Developing countries among us will promptly undertake actions whose projected effects on emissions represent a meaningful deviation from business as usual in the midterm, in the context of sustainable development, supported by financing, technology, and capacity-building," said the declaration from Thursday's Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate.
Environment groups gave the announcement a cautious welcome.
Obama said the G-8 targets and work with developing countries are intended to support the international climate change treaty that will succeed the Kyoto Protocol in 2012.

The Forum nations account for 80 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions.
In addition, the declaration recognized "that the timeframe for peaking will be longer in developing countries, bearing in mind that social and economic development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities in developing countries and that low-carbon development is indispensable to sustainable development."
However, Stern said the 2-degree threshold was the "underpinning" of the global goal for an overall 50 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, including the 80 percent cuts targeted by the G-8 countries.
In his remarks, Rudd made a point of welcoming the new leadership role by Obama and the United States.
Obama's father was a native of Kenya.
