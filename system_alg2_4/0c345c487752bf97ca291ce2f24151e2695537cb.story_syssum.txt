Los Angeles (CNN) -- A father and mother showed heroism when a gunman opened fired inside their California home before dawn Saturday, but two members of the family couldn't overcome their wounds, Inglewood police said.
Both were in critical but stable condition, police said.
Police were conducting a manhunt for the suspect, who lived in a house in the rear of the property.
That rear house was also set afire, believed to have been ignited by the gunman, police said.
Fallen power lines also hindered firefighting efforts.
The suspect should be considered armed and dangerous, the police chief said.
