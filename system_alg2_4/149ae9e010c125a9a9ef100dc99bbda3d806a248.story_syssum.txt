(CNN) -- Toy manufacturer LEGO, famous for its small plastic stackable bricks, is not allowed to register one of them as its trademark, the European Court of Justice has ruled.
LEGO argued that did not apply to its brick, because "bricks with virtually the same function can have other appearances," Kjaer said.
Kjaer said the decision will confuse LEGO customers.
Shoppers can see there is a different name on the box, but they believe it is a product line or company owned by us."
