Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to orchestrating Lloyd's killing with the help of Wallace and Carlos Ortiz.
Singleton has pleaded not guilty to being an accessory after the fact, accused of helping Wallace escape to Florida.

On Wednesday, Judge Susan Garsh will hear arguments and then decide whether the state can admit the jailhouse calls as evidence or if they will be barred.
