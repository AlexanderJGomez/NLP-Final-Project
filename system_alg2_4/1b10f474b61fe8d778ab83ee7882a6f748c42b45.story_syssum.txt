(CNN) -- Chief Clerk Walter Dimmick was convicted of stealing six bags of gold coins -- worth $30,000 -- from the U.S. Mint in San Francisco in 1901.
"We do not have any information linking the Saddle Ridge Hoard coins to any thefts at any United States Mint facility," he told CNN.
The treasure is known as the Saddle Ridge Hoard because it was discovered near a hill the couple called Saddle Ridge.
"The best theory is that -- and this is collaborated somewhat with doing some research, title searches, etc.
"If you had robbed the U.S. Mint in 1901, you'd have 1901, 1900, 1899 coins.
"We vetted this long time ago.
"Nothing resonates like buried treasure," Kagin said, as a smile broke across his face.

"Unlike other hoards and treasures, this one includes a great variety of coins struck over many different years, and many of the coins are still in pristine condition," Kagin said.
