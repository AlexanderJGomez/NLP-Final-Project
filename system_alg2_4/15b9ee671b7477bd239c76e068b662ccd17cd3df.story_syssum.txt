Judge Sonia Sotomayor would be the first Hispanic person to serve on the Supreme Court.
If confirmed, Sotomayor will be the first Hispanic person and only the third woman to serve on the nation's highest court.
Her story of battling past obstacles is an inspiration for all Hispanic people, said Roberto Ramirez, president-elect of the Puerto Rican Bar Association.
Although it may not be possible for everyone to succeed against the odds, "at this juncture, we are closer to the ideal than we have ever been," Ramirez said.
Ramirez said Latino people have been waiting a long time for a person of Latino descent to be nominated to the court.
"It's here!
David Perez, a 23-year-old student at Yale Law School, where Sotomayor attended, said many people in the Hispanic community feel such excitement about the nomination that they're almost numb.
Sotomayor's nomination "helps to create a tapestry of this country that is very reflective of the people who live in it," Ramirez said.
"While it is laudable and desirable to have a Supreme Court that reflects a diversity of views and backgrounds, Justices must check these at the Supreme Court door," Raquel Rodriguez, a Miami attorney who was general counsel to former Florida Gov.
Lopez, the college student in Texas, said she always thought her dream of becoming a prominent Latina attorney was possible.
But Sotomayor's nomination serves as proof, she said.
