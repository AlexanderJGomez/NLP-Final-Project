(CNN) -- Malawi said it won't host an African Union summit next month because the organization wants Omar al-Bashir, the Sudanese leader accused of war crimes in Darfur, to attend.
The AU, the organization of countries across the African continent, has said before that its members shouldn't cooperate with al-Bashir's arrest.
But other countries have canceled visits or have said that the wanted president is unwelcome.
"Malawi joins an increasing number of countries that have declined to welcome al-Bashir," said Alan Wallis, international justice lawyer at the Southern Africa Litigation Center, quoted by Human Rights Watch.
the Human Rights Watch said.
