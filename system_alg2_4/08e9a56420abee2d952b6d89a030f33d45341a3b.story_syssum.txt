In north-central Sri Lanka's Minneriya National Park, hundreds of elephants travel each year to the shores of an ancient reservoir built by a king more than 1,700 years ago.
They've made the trip for centuries, coming from across the region to bathe, mate, socialize and, most importantly, to feed as part of an annual event known as "The Gathering."
If you haven't heard of The Gathering or ever seriously considered visiting Sri Lanka, you're not alone.
"The increasing number of vehicles in the park and the unruly behavior of most are cause for much concern," says Ravi Corea, president of the Sri Lankan Wildlife Conservation Society (SLWCS).
In addition, they are habituating elephants to charge vehicles, which they will continue to do once they leave the national park with the beginning of the rains."
Conservationists are pushing government and park officials to ensure animals, humans and the local environment are better protected.
Recommendations include implementing stringent policies to govern how visitors and guides behave in the park, as well as providing training for rangers and drivers on how to conduct themselves while in the presence of wild elephants.
As word about Minneriya's main attraction spreads, the hope is that massive herds of elephants will continue migrating to the park each dry season, as they have for hundreds of years.
The best time to see The Gathering is during the dry season, from June to September.
For those who would rather have the whole trip arranged for them, tour companies like Asialuxe offer multi-day packages including airfare.
