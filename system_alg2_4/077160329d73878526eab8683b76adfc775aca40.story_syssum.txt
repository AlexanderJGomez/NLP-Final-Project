What's wrong with doing an updated version of a beloved Hollywood movie?
People might as well just watch the great version they already know (or, for new generations, have yet to discover).
Carrie, the rapturous and terrifying 1976 Brian De Palma thriller based on Stephen King's first novel, is a movie that has earned its place as a quirky horror milestone without, perhaps, ever having quite attained the status of a masterpiece.
Carrie is a timeless movie because it's both one of the most passionate and most scandalously funny horror films ever made.
At the same time, she offers just enough tweaks and updated details to present the material in a new way.
The fabled shower-room scene, in which the naïve, sheltered Carrie White (Chloë Grace Moretz) gets her first period and is shocked into thinking that she's dying, now has an added fillip of cruelty: Chris, the most hateful of the girls, doesn't just pelt Carrie with tampons and shout ''Plug it up!''
The original film had King's ingenious plot, with its fusion of innocence and cruelty and that subliminal wink of demonic takeover, but it also had De Palma's voluptuous operatic style, which gave the story the quality of a daydream-turned-nightmare.
Yet the way Peirce has updated Carrie White, without making any overt changes to the character, is to portray her as a little less clueless, a little less pathetic, a little more defiant.
Before, she was a total walking blob of misery and dysfunction.
And it's here that the real problem with redoing a classic reveals itself.
Sure, a lot of famous movies are timeless, yet they're also rooted in their time.
