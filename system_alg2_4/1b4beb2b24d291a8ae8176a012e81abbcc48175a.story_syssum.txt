(CNN) -- Calling his drug possession conviction a "wake-up call," U.S. Rep. Trey Radel says he is taking a leave of absence for an unspecified time and will enter an in-patient drug treatment program.
Radel spoke to reporters after returning home to Fort Myers, Florida, Wednesday night.
Sometimes in life you need a wake-up call.
Radel said he hopes he can win back the trust of the many people he hurt, including his wife.
Instead, he was placed on one year probation, and if it is "successfully completed," his guilty plea will be cleared from his record.
It was a sting that stemmed from a broader FBI/Drug Enforcement Administration investigation of a drug trafficking organization in the nation's capital, law enforcement officials told CNN on condition of anonymity.
But a dealer who was arrested last month told federal agents that one of his customers was a congressman, one of the law enforcement officials said.
Federal agents approached Radel after he left the vehicle, and Radel dropped the cocaine to the street, according to court documents.
He is active on Twitter, where he posts about touring the Capitol, listening to hip-hop, playing guitar and opposing Obamacare.
