New Orleans (CNN) -- When Kenneth Purcell emerged from his New Orleans home after Hurricane Isaac churned through the city in August, he couldn't believe what he saw.
He moved his company, iSeatz, a travel-and-entertainment booking engine, back to New Orleans in January 2008 after relocating to New York post-Katrina.
"The new people that I hired were here because they wanted to be," Purcell said.
The Greater New Orleans Community Data Center says that 427 of every 100,000 adults in the city started a business between 2008 and 2010 -- the most recent period for which data is available -- compared to a national rate of 333 of every 100,000 during that time.
"I've practiced in New Orleans for almost 40 years and I'm more excited about the future of the city today, than I ever have been," said Marcel Wisznia, owner of Wisznia Architecture and Development and a veteran entrepreneur.
He said he's observed a progression of new startups in the city in recent years -- and the catalyst for this entrepreneurial spark was Hurricane Katrina.
Boyd, a Louisiana native, asked city business insiders whether New Orleans could be a viable home for his company.
Boyd said.
Boyd now meets with a new startup every week and networks with other Web developers through groups like NOLA Meetup and gnocode, which connect people in the city's emerging tech scene.
Still, entrepreneurs face hurdles launching and growing tech companies in New Orleans, which has traditionally lacked the startup culture now thriving in Austin, Texas; New York and other cities.
On the surface, Williamson said, New Orleans would seem to be at a competitive disadvantage compared to other cities.
Entrepreneurs here say that community engagement is what makes New Orleans different.
Medbery believes the entrepreneurial spirit in New Orleans is unique.
