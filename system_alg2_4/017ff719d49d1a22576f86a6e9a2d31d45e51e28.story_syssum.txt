About 200,000 animals, including male water buffalo, goats and roosters will be slaughtered, despite protests from animal rights activists, according to the chief priest of the festival.
About 15,000 male water buffalo will be slaughtered, up from 12,000 five years ago, said Chaudhary, who is the 10th generation of his family to serve as chief priest.
Government officials say they cannot stop the centuries-old tradition, despite opposition from animal-rights activists from Nepal and India.
Though meat from the sacrificed animals is given to devotees, the hides of water buffalo are taken by the festival management committee to sell.
