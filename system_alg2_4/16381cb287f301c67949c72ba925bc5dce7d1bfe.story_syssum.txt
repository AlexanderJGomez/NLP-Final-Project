(CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius, the South African amputee who is running in the 2012 Olympics on prosthetic legs, might be surprised to learn he is part of a history that traces back 3,500 years.
For most of history, prosthetic limbs were used primarily to restore function and secondarily to mimic the human form (one of the Egyptian toes even had a false toenail).
Today, Pistorius' "Cheetah" legs are made of sophisticated curved composite carbon fiber that can handle fast running.
In 2007, however, the International Association of Athletics Federations banned Pistorius from competing in able-bodied competitions after tests at the German Sport University showed the Cheetah blades allowed him to expend less energy than able-bodied runners.
Further tests showed that Pistorius uses energy at the same rate as other elite runners, and that the Cheetah legs are not more efficient than human legs.
The issue will have to be revisited by each new athlete who wants to use artificial mechanisms in competition.
What about a swimmer who wants to use prosthetic hands or legs?
We do not have metrics that can determine true equivalence with able-bodied athletes.
What is a disability?
In 1997, Casey Martin, a professional golfer with a circulatory disorder, sued under the American with Disabilities Act to be allowed to use a golf cart to play in the U.S. Open.
"Disability" is a medical term, but it is also a legal and a social term; one can have a disability according to medicine but not law, or be considered disabled by social convention but not law or medicine.
Sport is an artificial world.
The great symbolic power of the Olympics is that we all agree on the same rules and then abide by them.
Pistorius' supporters argue instead that fairness in sport means allowing all qualified people to compete, even those born without fibulas.
