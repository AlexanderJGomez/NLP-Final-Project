In many ways, it would mirror portions of what Mitt Romney began to outline in a recent USA Today op-ed.
For most Americans, health care is like plumbing: They know they need it; they don't truly know how it works, but they definitely know when it's not working.
And if they can message it properly, they'll be in a sweet spot.
