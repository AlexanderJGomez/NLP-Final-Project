Atlanta (CNN) -- Atlanta's schools will flag suspicious test scores and achieve a culture of integrity in the wake of a cheating scandal that could lead to criminal charges against some principals and teachers, officials vowed Thursday.
Investigators said 178 teachers and principals working at 44 schools were involved in the cheating scandal.
The educators, including 38 principals, were either directly involved in erasing wrong answers on a key standardized test or they knew -- or should have known -- what was going on, according to the governor's office.
The investigation's findings have been forwarded to the state teacher licensing board, Deal said.
The system's former superintendent on Wednesday denied she knew of any widespread falsification by educators of student test results.
"I do not accept a focus on performance causes people to cheat," Davis said.
Investigators compared the results with test results from other Georgia schools and found that such patterns did not occur normally, Deal said.
"I believe there are personnel who don't need to work with students anymore," said Kathryn Grogg, whose twin daughters are entering first grade and attend a school not implicated in the scandal.
Marcia Klenbort, whose three children attended Atlanta Public Schools, said the school board failed to hold Hall accountable and did not adequately address the cheating before the state stepped in.
Administrators must ensure there are equal opportunities at all schools, she said, while parents must become more involved in their children's education -- both at school and home.
"This unfortunate incident highlights the need for transparency and accountability throughout our education system," Duncan said in a statement Thursday.
