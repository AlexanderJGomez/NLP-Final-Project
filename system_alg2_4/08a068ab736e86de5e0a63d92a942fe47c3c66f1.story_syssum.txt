This wasn't the Kiss nightclub in southern Brazil, where more than 230 souls lost their lives Sunday.
"I can't help but watch because I'm one of them," Gina Russo told CNN affiliate WPRI-TV.
Russo suffered serious burns in the fire, but the flames claimed the life of her fiance, Fred Crisostomi.
Nobody has learned anything," he told CNN affiliate WJAR-TV.
The Station fire brought changes to Rhode Island law, requiring sprinklers at buildings that can house more than 150 people and limiting pyrotechnics.
Michael and Jeffrey Derderian, the two brothers who owned the club, pleaded no contest to 100 counts each of involuntary manslaughter.
"It just takes time and patience and to know you're not alone."
"If only they had learned from our tragedy."
