These two recent, racially charged incidents have some wondering if the school affectionately called Ole Miss is still stuck in the old days.
And an attorney for one of the three students sought for questioning in the statue incident said Friday there is video evidence that absolves his client.
He was not near the statue.
Coghlan said his client has been "ruled out" by the university and has no plans to talk to university police at this time.
The three 19-year-olds, whose identities have not been released by police, are from Georgia and are freshmen at Ole Miss, according to a statement from the university's chief of police, Calvin Sellers.
"It's unclear at this time if the incident is related to the incident last Sunday on campus," Oxford Deputy Police Chief James Owens said.
James Meredith became the first black student admitted to Ole Miss in 1962.
"I'm shocked but not surprised by what happened," Judy Meredith said.
"I'm surprised something didn't happen to the statue earlier."
"For this to occur in 2014 is an insult to the legacy of James Meredith, The University of Mississippi community, and the SigEp alumni who fought for racial equality in the late 1950s," the fraternity said in a statement.
"I think it's absolutely terrible what they did," freshman John Choat said.
"Can't believe they are still doing stuff like that at Ole Miss," he tweeted.
Racism "happens in every campus, in every high school, in every community," Hodge said.
