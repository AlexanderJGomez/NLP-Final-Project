Now that the government has shut down, the institute can still use existing resources to continue Hubble operations for as long as possible.
If Hubble encounters a problem or a glitch, as happens occasionally, science operations will be suspended and the spacecraft will be locked into safe mode until government employees can issue spacecraft commands to restore operations.
Special science panels spend weeks setting priorities for the most important proposed science investigations.
That means each week the government is shut down could cost dozens to hundreds of critical astronomical observations.
If the shutdown lasts more than a few weeks, the JWST instrument module will have to be warmed up, probably pushing the launch date forward by a few months and raising the cost commensurately (about $1 million per day).
To check on the number of satellites that might be affected by the shutdown, this author tried to access a NASA website, only to see the following message: "Due to the lapse in federal government funding, this website is not available.
This prompted further searching.
Their flagship mission, the Mars Science Laboratory and its Curiosity Rover, is apparently still active, operated by team members who work for JPL or Caltech or other participating institutions other than the federal government.
The government shutdown means they are forbidden to do any work.
For the past few weeks, we've had intensive discussions with colleagues around the world about the science this telescope will be able to do.
We are all waiting.
