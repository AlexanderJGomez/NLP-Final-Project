Cuban rap duo "Doble Filo" say hip hop allows them to embrace social issues.
Formed in 1996, rap duo "Doble Filo" ("Double Edged") have been part of the Havana scene since the beginning and work with the Cuban Rap Agency.
Along with fellow Cuban rap duo "Los Aldeanos" ("The Villagers") "Doble Filo" work with U.S. hip hop audio/visual label, Emetrece Productions.
But "Los Aldeanos", who formed in 2003, are part of a younger generation of Cuban rappers.
"Our lyrics don't always go with the standard Cuban rhetoric and often that won't get airplay," says Rodriguez.
Bian Rodriguez, also known as El B, the other member of "Los Aldeanos," says hip hop gives voice to the concerns of ordinary Cubans.
Like most other Cuban rap groups, "Los Aldeanos" aren't yet in a position to make a living from their music.

More than just promoting good music, she says Emetrece is trying to educate, and to challenge the U.S. embargo on Cuba.
Like Cuba's rappers, she sees hip hop as a tool for social change.
