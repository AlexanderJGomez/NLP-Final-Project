Beijing (CNN) -- Families of Chinese passengers on board missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 have engaged in a rare late-night act of civil disobedience in this tightly-controlled city.
They're lying to us," the man repeated.
Though vastly out-numbered by Chinese security forces, the family members continued their stubborn vigil throughout the morning.
Periodically, they chanted "Fulfill your commitments!
For weeks, distraught next of kin have requested face-to-face meetings with Malaysian officials.
On several occasions within the last two weeks, Malaysian officials in Beijing and Kuala Lumpur publicly pledged to meet the Chinese families within a matter of 24 hours, but then failed to show up for talks.
He spoke to CNN in a "journalist's area" located out of sight of the Malaysian Embassy protest.
The Malaysia Airlines crisis, which has involved the highly emotional disappearance of 153 Chinese nationals who were on board the plane, has put Chinese authorities in an uncomfortable position.
On Friday a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, Qin Gang, called on the families protesting outside the embassy to "express their appeals in a legal and rational way" while pledging to give them further assistance.
