The former European player of the year is competing in his first professional golf tournament as part of the Kharkov Superior Cup in his native Ukraine, but struggled to a 12-over-par 84 in Thursday's opening round.
"I am not a big fan of football so I didn't really know much about Andriy but it was great to play with him.
Shevchenko, who enjoyed most of his success with Italian club AC Milan, retired from football a year ago after Ukraine co-hosted the European Championships and has since dabbled in politics.
"I just found this great game where you have to be focused and balanced and that's why I like it.
"To play with Victor and see him shoot a course record and play fantastic golf, I learned so much about the game from the two guys," he said.
"It's the first event for me and also in Ukraine so it's big for golf here," he said.
"I love golf and I'm so happy that golf is starting to pick up in Ukraine and the people are starting to invest money long term."
