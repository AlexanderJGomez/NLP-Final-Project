While not as high-profile as many congressional races, gubernatorial campaigns are statewide races and can reveal political and policy trends that play out nationally.
Additionally, the State House is often a spring board to the White House.
While Texas is a solidly Republican state, the liberal left is heavily involved as they see a winner in candidate Wendy Davis.
Stuart Rothenberg of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report wrote that Davis faces an uphill battle with the still-to-be-determined Republican candidate holding an advantage in the reliably red state.
This year, Gov.
Elected in 2010 with the support of the tea party, the former Congressman initially championed conservative agenda that included dramatic cuts to state pensions.
And as in any battleground state, the party not in power often has a shot.
The primary will be the first real test for the governor's race in one of the most populous and politically important states.
Former Republican Gov.
If he wins his primary against state Sen. Nan Rich, he'll face Republican incumbent Rick Scott, whose tenure has been tenuous.
Republican incumbent Scott Walker is running for re-election -- again.
While Cook rates this race as a likely win for Walker, Democrats are rallying behind Mary Burke, a member of the Madison school board and former Trek bike executive.
It is a reliably Democratic state and home to the President, so a loss would be especially difficult for a party that has lost ground in state legislatures in recent years.
The race is considered a tossup by Cook even though Republicans don't yet have a strong candidate.
If so, that's a stark shift from the just a couple months earlier when he tangled with the Democratic-controlled state Legislature.
