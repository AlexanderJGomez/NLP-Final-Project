Yet despite our struggles, my family never lost hope that life would get better for us.
And as trivial as it may seem, a lot of that had to do with Red Lobster.
It meant twice, sometimes three times a year, a poor family like mine could order a steak in a middle-class restaurant and pretend we were rich.
Red Lobster was the biggest culprit.
But for black households like the one I grew up in, income fell by nearly 11%, more than twice the rate of Latino homes and three times that of whites.
But it's a mistake to blame the erosion of buying power and the decline of middle-class touchstones like Red Lobster or JCPenney on just the Great Recession.
And that may not seem like much until you realize that almost every year since 1983, a series of small ticks like those two examples has been widening the gap between between what we earn and what we can buy.
However, the actual 2013 poverty threshold is $23,492, a difference of $325.03.
It's just the one that happens to have an interesting tie to the poor folks I knew.
That also happens to be the same year Red Lobster was founded.
