Now Marty has received a fitting, very personal tribute in the form of "Chef Supreme: Martin Ginsburg," a cookbook released this week by the Supreme Court Historical Society.
And sprinkled throughout are photos (including the chef getup) and remembrances from his children, friends, and fellow spouses of the justices.
"The way he writes recipes really reflects his playful personality."
"The Supreme Court is a very collegial place, partly because of the protocols that have been in place for decades, (which) help bring the justices themselves together as a group.
While both possessed strong legal minds, Ruth is soft-spoken, genteel, and serious of purpose.
Marty experimented, sometimes for years, to perfect his creations.
"The above recipe may be only authentic mid-Manhattan (where the Ginsburgs once resided), but on information, belief, and ten years of testimony from innumerable diners -- including my wife, who is otherwise a confirmed anchovy hater -- it is more than edible."
He once brought back meat from a wild boar he shot, prompting Marty to create a suitable marinade of carrots, shallots, dry white wine, and even crushed juniper berries among his various ingredients.
Cushman and her friends and colleagues actually tested all 47 recipes in the book, narrowed from a repertoire of hundreds of often elaborate dishes.
"Professor Ginsburg is a regular contributor to the lighter side of life at the Supreme Court," said the justice in March 2009.
"Mainly he performs in the kitchen, for the quarterly spouses' lunches held at the Court and, occasionally in past years, at a dinner for the entire Court family -- justices, their spouses, and widows of former Court members.
"Being the spouse of a Supreme Court justice is not always an easy role to play, and Marty Ginsburg made it more fun than perhaps it had been in the past," Cushman said.
A true partnership."
