Tavis Smiley, talk show host and author, has always used his platform to discuss the issues of the black community and the country as a whole.
That said, I respectfully disagree with West and Smiley's characterization of President Obama's first term in office.
Smiley has accused the president of ignoring the issues of the black community.
They ignore the positive moves Obama has made to benefit -- in real ways -- the black community, the poor, the disadvantaged, and the country as a whole.
Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which he shepherded and signed into law, insurance companies are no longer allowed to deny insurance to individuals because of pre-existing conditions.
Then there is the Children's Health Insurance Re-authorization Act, signed into law by Obama, which provides health care to millions of kids .
President Obama signed The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which invests $5 billion in early childhood programs like Head Start.
There's more.
He signed a bill extending unemployment insurance.
Unemployment is 9.1 %.
If West and Smiley would like Obama to do more, that's valid.
His campaign adviser, David Axelrod, says Obama will soon announce a jobs plan that is expected to include an extension of payroll tax cuts, new revenue for transportation projects and an extension of emergency unemployment benefits.
I'm not saying that President Obama should be exempt from criticism, nor do I believe it is some act of racial treason for a black person to hold our president accountable for his actions.
Obama said in his victory speech, "even as we celebrate tonight we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime.
Our climb will be steep.
