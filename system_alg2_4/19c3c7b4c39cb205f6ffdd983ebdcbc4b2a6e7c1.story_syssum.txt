A soft-spoken and shy man, Shin shared his harrowing story about escaping from a total control zone called Camp 14, giving Western audiences an accessible reading on North Korea.
Blaine Harden, author of "Escape From Camp 14," wrote on his website that Shin had admitted several inaccuracies, including the length of time he spent in Camp 14.
Shin's admission of inaccuracies comes at a time of unparalleled attention on North Korea's human rights record following a landmark U.N. Commission of Inquiry report listing abuses of the Pyongyang regime.
While "Escape From Camp 14" was not the sole reason for the creation of the commission, Navi Pillay, then the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, urged the probe after meeting Shin and another North Korean prison camp survivor in December 2012.
Their stories are powerful and convincing, and these stories do not only represent Shin but other people in North Korea."
In a reversal of his story told for years, Shin told Harden on Friday that he had been transferred to another prison, Camp 18, when he was 6, instead of spending his entire life inside North Korea at the total control zone Camp 14, the author says on his website.
And Harden noted in his book that during the interview process, Shin at times was unreliable and "in many crucial instances, corrected his Korean memoir" -- an autobiography that Shin wrote in 2007, called "Escape to the Outside World," which was only published in Korean.
"Shin became an icon for North Korean human rights.
Whether he was in Camp 14 or Camp 18, he is definitely a person from a political prison camp.
