The House Justice Committee dismissed the impeachment complaint by 42-8 votes, saying that it was "insufficient in substance," the state-run Philippines News Agency reported.
"I'm not saying that there is no substance (to the complaint), but it was insufficient," Deputy House Speaker Pablo Garcia told the committee before the vote.
She won re-election in 2004, but opposition parties called into question the legitimacy of that race.
The first of the impeachment charges were brought against Arroyo in 2005 for vote-tampering.
Her six-year term ends in 2010.
