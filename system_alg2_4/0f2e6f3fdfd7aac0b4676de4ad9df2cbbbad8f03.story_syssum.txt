(CNN) -- The United Nations is asking countries and donors around the world to send urgent aid to the victims of the flooding in Pakistan, one-fifth of which is now under water.
"Floods are always more difficult to raise money for than dramatic seismic events that happen suddenly, because the scale of it only creeps up on people," Wynter said.
"It's very hard to compare disasters," said Nicholas Reader, spokesman for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
Pakistan has been a slowly evolving disaster."
More people have been affected than in the 2004 South Asia tsunami, the 2005 South Asia earthquake, and the Haiti earthquake combined.
The United Nations asked for $460 million to cover six million Pakistanis over the next three months, but has only raised one-third of that so far.
In Haiti, the United Nations received $286 million in just three days.
"In the meantime, many more thousands of people in Pakistan will die as a result of these floods."
Donors like to give money to problems they feel they can help solve.
"There was a great outpouring of aid for Haiti," Rauf said from Islamabad.
Over and over again.
