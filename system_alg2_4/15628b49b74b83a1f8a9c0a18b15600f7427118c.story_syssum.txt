(CNN) -- The new iPhone 5S's performance upgrades and 64-bit processing chip will make the smartphone more responsive and faster.
Technical director Geremy Mustard said the new power in the iPhone 5S has allowed his team to craft the ultimate "Infinity Blade" experience.
Creative director Donald Mustard believes mobile gaming will get another giant push forward with the phone's new technology, calling it "true next-gen gaming" on a device that fits in your pocket.
Both Donald and Geremy said they did not have early access to iOS 7 or the new iPhone 5S when they were building "Infinity Blade III," but they design their games with future tech in mind.
We don't know how long you'll be able to play on the new phone, but on the iPhone 5, I could game on a flight from Salt Lake to New York ... about 5 or 6 hours."
The new "parallax effect" included in iOS 7 will create depth on what has traditionally been a flat display for the iPhone and game controller support will offer a new way to play games on the go with the smartphone.
"The new controller puts Apple at the forefront of bridging the ever-shrinking gap between consoles and iOS devices."
Mobile gaming will definitely get a boost from the new technology available to developers.
Donald Mustard said the younger generation is growing up with mobile devices and they are the ones who are going to spur the mobile gaming proliferation in terms of quality and power.
