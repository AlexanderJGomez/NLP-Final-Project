New York (CNN) -- New York City's Board of Health voted Thursday to ban the sale of sugary drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces in restaurants and other venues, in a move meant to combat obesity and encourage residents to live healthier lifestyles.
"What we need in New York are sensible solutions to the obesity issue that focus on a comprehensive approach to tackle an extremely complex problem," said Eliot Hoff, a spokesman for a beverage industry-sponsored group called New Yorkers for Beverage Choices.
New York City spends an estimated $4 billion each year on medical care for overweight people, the mayor said in an earlier statement.
"6 months from today, our city will be an even healthier place," Bloomberg tweeted on Thursday.
