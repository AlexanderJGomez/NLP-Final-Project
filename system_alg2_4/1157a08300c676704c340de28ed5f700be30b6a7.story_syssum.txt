Forgive the wistful opening but it's true.
And there were only 620,000 Internet users across the entire country.
This was the dawn of dot-coms in China.
Seventeen years ago, the dotcom diet in Beijing was MSG-laced instant noodles and cigarettes at your desk.
In 1999, I met fellow American expat Porter Erisman for dinner while he was leading the Internet marketing group at Ogilvy & Mather in Beijing.
I recently caught up with Porter to reminisce about that time and learn more about why he decided to take that risk and join a Chinese Internet start-up.
"For me, there's some satisfaction in seeing that the company I played a role in building in the early days has grown to become possibly the world's largest e-commerce company," he says.
I too left my Chinese dotcom to become a storyteller of sorts.
As a journalist, the tension and the opportunity of China's now mammoth dotcoms has been a thrill to both witness and report.
