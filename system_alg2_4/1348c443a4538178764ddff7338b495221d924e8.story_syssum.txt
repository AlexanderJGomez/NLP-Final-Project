Milledgeville police said they were called to Creekside Elementary School on Friday for an unruly juvenile, who was allegedly throwing a tantrum.
The girl was released to Ruff after numerous attempts to reach her parents failed, the police report said.
Is that the first step?"
"They don't have no business calling the police and handcuffing my child," said Salecia's father, Earnest Johnson.
Johnson's mother said her daughter was suspended and cannot return to school until August.
Police notified the Department of Family and Children's Services about the incident, which is not the first of its kind in recent memory.
The child appeared to have calmed down by the time police officers arrive, but began screaming as two officers, a man and a woman, stood her up, leaned her toward a table and handcuffed her.
