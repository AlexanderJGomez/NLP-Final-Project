Well, if I -- a son of immigrants whose family had nothing to do with any of those accomplishments -- if I get to claim those aspects of American history, then surely I have to claim the unsavory aspects too.

Every time protests and violence break out in response to police brutality, the same depressing pattern breaks out.

Both a history of police brutality and a present crisis of street violence.
And until more people can see this, we will not see progress.
But it cannot possibly be that only those with whom I disagree are responsible for what is happening in Baltimore.
Because we are.
And there is no other "we" waiting in the wings.
