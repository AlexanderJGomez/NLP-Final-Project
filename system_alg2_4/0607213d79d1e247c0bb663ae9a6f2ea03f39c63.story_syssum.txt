But for many others, including myself, Twitter has become the new "Fight Club."
Chang's.
"Fight Club" celebrated the duality of life.
This is what Twitter is to many.
In fact, Humboldt University recently created a map entitled "The Geography of Hate" which charted the hate filled comments being spewed on Twitter.
But these comments are tame when compared to the far more hateful comments launched on Twitter against Blacks, Latinos, gays, and the disabled as noted by the Humboldt study.
Sure, you can do that, but as Tyler Durden instructively told us in "Fight Club": "How much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight."
In today's hyperpartisan climate, many just associate with like-minded people and consequently their views on political issues are never challenged.
True, these battles can become heated and include nasty comments, but for the most part they remain issue-oriented and avoid bigotry.
Here's my plea to my fellow Twitter users: We need to make it clear that there's simply no place for that type of hate on Twitter.
If enough of us collectively speak out, Twitter can become a social media platform where users share info, joke around and even fight with each other, but all without being subject to hate.
