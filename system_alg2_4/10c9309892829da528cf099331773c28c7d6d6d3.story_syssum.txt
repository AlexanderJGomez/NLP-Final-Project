LONDON, England -- A Colombian sculptor has created a mystery at London's Tate Modern gallery by refusing to reveal how she seemingly managed to crack open a concrete floor.

Tate director Nicholas Serota insisted the work was no optical illusion.

Salcedo said of the work: "It represents borders, the experience of immigrants, the experience of segregation, the experience of racial hatred.
