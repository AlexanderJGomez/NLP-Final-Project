New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Close allies since the Soviet days, India and Russia marked the first decade of their strategic partnership with a slew of agreements at their annual summit Tuesday.
Apart from 11 agreements the two countries signed during the Medvedev-Singh news conference, a contract for joint design and development of fifth-generation fighter aircraft was also being concluded on the margins of the current summit, officials say.
"Both sides expressed satisfaction with the progress in bilateral cooperation in the nuclear-energy sector and looked forward to further broadening and strengthening ties in this area," the joint statement said.
"Russia is a time-tested friend of India that has stood by us in our times of need in the past.
The two nations forged a strategic partnership in 2000 and have since been holding summits every year.
Medvedev's trip to New Delhi follows similar trade-promoting visits by U.S. President Barack Obama, France's Nicolas Sarkozy and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao.
