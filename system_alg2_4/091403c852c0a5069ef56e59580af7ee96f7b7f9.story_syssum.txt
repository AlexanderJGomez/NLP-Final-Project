BEIJING, China (CNN) -- A massive fire engulfed a newly constructed, unoccupied luxury hotel in central Beijing on Monday night as crowds watched a nearby fireworks display marking the end of Lunar New Year celebrations.
iReporter Jean de Villeneuve lives about 200 yards (200 meters) from the fire and said she watched it for about an hour before firefighters got it under control.
De Villeneuve said she and others were able to get within 60 yards of the fire.
It was a spectacular sight for sure," he said.
iReporter Stephen Chaytor said he was walking home from work when he saw the fire.

The blaze erupted in the final hours of the Chinese Lunar New Year celebration as people set off fireworks across the city.
iReporter de Villeneuve said she suspects many people in the city were trying to use whatever remaining fireworks they had before the deadline.
"Then we looked closer and saw the flames come from the top of the building," Rice said.
According to its Web site, the Mandarin Oriental-Beijing is the flagship property in China for the Mandarin Oriental hotel chain.
