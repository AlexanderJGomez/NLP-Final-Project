The musicians are now exchanging bitter words in public while fighting in court over who owns the right to use the New Order name.
New Order was formed in 1980 by Sumner, Hook and drummer Steven Morris, who had previously been in melancholy post-punk band Joy Division until the death of singer Ian Curtis.
However, Sumner, Morris and Gilbert reformed four years later without him and are now touring and planning to release new material under the New Order name.
It's like being divorced and getting shown the door without even being told why."
"Will we get back together?
Hook likens the dispute to four people who run a shop for 30 years together.
But they resurrected it first when they played as Bad Lieutenant (the band name Sumner performed under between 2008 and 2011) without asking me.
Hook's new band The Light is playing two dates in the United States this week, performing the first two New Order albums, 1981's "Movement" and "Power, Corruption and Lies" from 1983 in their entirety.
"'Movement' is a very Joy Division record with New Order vocals, whereas by the time "Power, Corruption & Lies" came along, it was a proper New Order record.
On previous tours Hook's group played the two Joy Division albums, material New Order rarely performed.
Hook acknowledges the name of his old band is far better known to fans than that of his new one, so the legal battle over who owns the trademark is not just a matter of pride.
No one wants to hear your new stuff anyway, they want to hear your old stuff."
