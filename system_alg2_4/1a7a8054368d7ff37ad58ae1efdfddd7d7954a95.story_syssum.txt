CNN's Suzanne Malveaux shares a light moment with President Bush during his final press conference Monday.
It took the president a little time to warm up.

It travels with you wherever you go."

But later in the press conference he was defiant about Hurricane Katrina, telling us: "Don't tell me the federal response was slow when there was 30,000 people pulled off roofs right after the storm passed."

Q: The president ribbed you about the pronunciation of your name because it's French, even jokingly saying you can call him "Georges."
When I first met the president, he called me Suzanne [said: Sue-zan], and I initially corrected him: "It's Suzanne.
Sometimes I thought he intentionally called me "Sue-zan," if he was angry with my questions.
She was out there, front row center with her hand raised.
