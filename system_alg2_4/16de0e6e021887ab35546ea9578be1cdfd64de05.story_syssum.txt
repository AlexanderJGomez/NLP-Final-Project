Going abroad can expose travelers to more than new cultures and once-in-a-lifetime experiences.

No single country can deal with these health threats alone.
CDC is helping countries around the world strengthen their ability to prevent avoidable catastrophes and epidemics, detect threats early, and respond rapidly and effectively.
That's why we announced Thursday that the United States, through the work of the CDC and the departments of Agriculture, State, and Defense, has committed to cooperate with at least 30 partner countries to better prevent, detect, and effectively respond to infectious disease threats, better protecting at least 4 billion people around the world -- including the United States -- from threats.
Helping other countries makes those countries, and the United States, safer.
