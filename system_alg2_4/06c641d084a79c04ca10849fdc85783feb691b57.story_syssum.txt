Their AdTrap device intercepts online advertisements before they reach any devices that access your Internet connection, allowing you to surf the Web -- even stream videos -- without those annoying ads.
So, Russell and Butkus set out to recreate the past and they came up with AdTrap.
The funds are being used by parent company Bluepoint Security, a mobile antivirus software firm, to manufacture the AdTrap units.
Compared to the various software ad-blockers, Russell said a hardware solution is more effective because it works on every device connected to your network.
There are a couple of sites like Hulu, for instance where AdTrap doesn't work, but Russell said they're working on some solutions.
"At some point, it's gotten a bit much," Russell said, referring to online ads.
"We're not trying to be against all advertisers," said Julie Russell, Chad Russell's mother, who handles finances for AdTrap.
