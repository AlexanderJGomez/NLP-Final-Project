It's as if someone went to Paris and said, 'ooh, that's a nice park,' and rolled it up and dropped it on top of the desert," notes Thomas Heatherwick, the British designer of the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics cauldron and the London Routemaster bus.
"There can be a mentality that can easily exist here that sees the desert as a surface to be covered up, instead of maybe celebrating its uniqueness," says Heatherwick, who recently unveiled plans for proposed 1.3-million-square-foot Al Fayah Park.
Heatherwick imagines it as a space where residents will congregate to picnic, or catch an outdoor concert.
Al Fayah Park, he hopes, will be offer the city's residents a viable alternative.
It's almost like Abu Dhabi's first hill," he says.
"The partial shade will mean we can use half the quantity of water that the current site used, and create more lushness in the process," he says.
