Currently in its third year, the glamorous event saw dozens of big names and up-and-coming designers from across the continent descending on the UK capital's hip district of Shoreditch to unveil their latest stylish creations.
In many ways, the event reaffirmed why Africa-inspired designs are fast catching the eye of the fashion world.
"Women who are very feminine and sexy."
But despite the growing interest in African designs, Ademiluyi says that many of the continent's promising talents still find it difficult to break into the mainstream international shows.
"They don't have support from anywhere, so what we do is we support them -- it's an affordable platform for the designers to showcase their talents to the world."
"For a lot of them, after Africa Fashion Week, that's it," she says.
