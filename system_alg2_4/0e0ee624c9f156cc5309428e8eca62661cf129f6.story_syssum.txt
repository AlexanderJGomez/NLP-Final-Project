Adm. Mike Mullen has been Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, the president's top military adviser, since October of 2007.
"Mike, as you look back at your four consequential years as chairman and your four decades in uniform, be assured: Our military is stronger and our nation is more secure because of the service that you have rendered."
"And he really likes it when you laugh at his jokes.
Mullen said.
Dempsey becomes Panetta's and Obama's right hand man in navigating the withdrawal from Afghanistan and the hard choices about budget cuts.
Instead of trying to leap ahead decades into the future as we design our military, we must build a force able to handle the challenges we know it will face today, and one that can adapt to the future."
Mullen said Afghanistan will be Dempsey's biggest challenge.
The new chairman, the first Army general elevated to chairman since 2001, had the last word.
