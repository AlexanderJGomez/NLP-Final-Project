LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Perhaps Ryan Seacrest said it best at the top of the "American Idol" Tuesday night when describing Adam Lambert and Kris Allen, the show's final two contestants.
In the first round, where the contestants chose a song from a favorite past performance this season, Simon Cowell declared Kris Allen the winner after his rendition of "Ain't No Sunshine" on piano.
"I think 'Mad World' is kind of symbolic," Lambert told reporters after the show.
He then gave round two to Lambert.
Cowell told the 27-year-old afterward that "you have been one of the best, most original contestants we've ever had on the show."
"There was a lot of lyric, and it was a big song," said Lambert.
"He's always giving me stuff to change about mine ... to make it better," Allen told reporters.
A little over an hour before the show began, a magnitude 4.0 quake aftershock hit 10 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.
