3. iPhone users are eight times more likely than BlackBerry users to access phishing sites.
Boodaei speculates that many BlackBerry users are business users who were issued their BlackBerry by their employer, ostensibly with at least some security training.
Although phishing attempts are most likely immediately after a data breach, they can occur weeks or months later.

Or just look up the company's phone number and call them, an action that's especially easy from your mobile phone.
