Tokyo (CNN) -- A simmering dispute over islands in the East China Sea began to bite into trade between China and Japan on Tuesday as Chinese protests prompted Japanese companies to suspend work there.
Panasonic reported Monday that it would stop work at three Chinese plants after two of them were damaged during Saturday's protests.
But political ties between Tokyo and Beijing have been strained over a cluster of islands that both countries claim, known as the Senkaku to the Japanese and the Diaoyu to the Chinese.
China reasserted that claim last week, sending ships to patrol the area after the Japanese government announced it would buy several of the islands from a Japanese family.
And the ocean floor may hold as much as 100 billion barrels of oil, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, as well abundant natural gas reserves that the Chinese are already seeking to tap.
A total of 11 Chinese government ships were near the islands on Tuesday afternoon, the Japanese Coast Guard said, adding that it had warned the vessels not to enter Japanese territorial waters.
"The U.S. handed over the islands to Japan for its own purpose during the Cold War," Guo Xiangjiang, the deputy director of the China Institute of International Studies, told CNN.
"We reserve the right to take further actions, but we hope the issue will be properly resolved through peaceful ways and negotiations," he said, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua.
Japan's attempts to portray the purchase as a routine internal real-estate transaction, with the islands passing from one Japanese owner to another, has failed to placate the Chinese authorities.
