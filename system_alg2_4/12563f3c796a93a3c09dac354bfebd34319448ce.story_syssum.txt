Polcari had just been laid off from her job, and now she and her husband were looking at an $850 bill.
Now?
Of all times?'
But now, they didn't know what to do.
"It's to prevent dogs from being surrendered to shelters or euthanized when their owners cannot afford care," said Marlo Manning, who founded Fairy DogParents.
"Most of the people we help, they're doing their best to get back on track.
...
Get through this, and we'll help you.'
Manning knows how much an ailing dog can cost.
"Having gone through a job loss myself, I thought: 'I'm really glad that we had Ladybug when we did, because we were able to afford it.
"
They couldn't afford to feed them, never mind get them medicine," Manning recalled.
"
I chose to find a way to sponsor other people who could not afford to keep their dog.
And the other was to keep another dog from going to a shelter since that system is already stressed enough as it is."
"The money is given directly to the vet or pharmacy," Manning said.
"A lot of the people that we sponsor ... have already lost so much that the one thing they try to hang on to is their dog," Manning said.
"A lot of them have lost their jobs.
"We're just completely surprised that they were just able to help us out with the full (sponsorship) amount," Polcari said of the assistance her family received.
This dog is with its family and never had to go into a shelter," Manning said, beaming.
The dog doesn't even know we exist, and we're just making sure it gets to the ball."
