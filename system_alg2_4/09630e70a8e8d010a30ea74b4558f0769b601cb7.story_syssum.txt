Sichuan province, China (CNN) -- It's after 10 p.m. when we see a light in the distance.
Our Chinese driver is already outside the car.
For weeks, ethnic Tibetans and Chinese security forces have been locked in conflict.
The Tibetan says his village is crawling with police and the military.
Later, local news reports tell of two Tibetans killed in protests.
Local media reports say more than a dozen people have already been killed.
It is fueled by government secrecy and a constant stream of military and police vehicles.
We see a group of young monks on a corner and wave them over.
Here in a tiny one bedroom apartment, four beds crammed against the walls and their food tied in sacks, the monks tell us they are verbally abused and harassed by police, pushed to breaking point.
"We want to go but we cannot, you can see all the security out there.
For the Chinese government, though, these are dangerous men -- part of what they call a "splittist" element, determined to tear Tibet from China.
Throughout our interview, we have been watched.
Eventually trying to clear airport security, we're grabbed by police.
Later, Chinese authorities black out CNNI when our report airs about the situation in the ethnically Tibetan area.
All of it is being played out behind a veil of secrecy in the mountains of western China.
