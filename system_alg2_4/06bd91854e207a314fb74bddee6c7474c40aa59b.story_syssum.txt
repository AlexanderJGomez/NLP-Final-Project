"Basically I'm just making potato salad.
In a campaign that went online over the holiday weekend, Brown's goal was to raise only $10.
"$10 seemed like a good, conservative goal.
A pledge of $1 -- of which there were more than 300 by Sunday evening -- earns a "thank you" from Brown on the website as well as aloud while the potato salad is made.
As the campaign caught steam over the holiday weekend, a new goal was set: at $3,000 the "whole Internet" would be invited to Columbus to taste the potato salad.
"It could take me weeks to make it."
