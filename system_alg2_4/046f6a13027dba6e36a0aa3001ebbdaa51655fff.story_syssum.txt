"During a brainstorming session, we were talking about discounts and promotions and wanted to come up with something different than the same promotions and discounts," said Rancho Bernardo general manager John Gates.
"For $19 a night, a customer gets a shell with a tent inside," said Gates.
The promotion will run from August 16 to 31.
