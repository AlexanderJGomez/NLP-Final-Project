The opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that Islamist rebels were responsible for the attack and that at least 11 of the victims were civilians.
"The Syrian people desperately need an end to violence and a clean break from the past to move toward a new Syria, one in which their legitimate aspirations are met and all communities are protected," said a representative for Ban.
Syrian troops lobbed shells laced with chlorine at a western Syrian town on Thursday, causing dozens to suffer from the inhalation of toxic gas, the opposition-run Hama Media Center said.
Kafr Zeita.is the same opposition-held location where the United States and its allies believe al-Assad's government used the toxic gas in an April 11 attack.
More than 650 prisoners died either due to deteriorating conditions or at the hands of jailers, whom the center alleges carried out torture and summary executions.
