LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Michael Jackson's ex-wife and the mother of his two oldest children, Debbie Rowe, has agreed not to challenge the singer's mother for custody of the children, according to a joint statement from lawyers for Rowe and Katherine Jackson.
Rowe never publicly said if she would fight Jackson's 79-year-old mother for custody of her son and daughter -- ages 11 and 12 -- and a court hearing concerning custody was delayed several times this month while lawyers for the two talked.
Beckloff will also hear arguments Monday about Jackson's estate and who will control it.
"We were all united in our goals to do what is best for Michael's wonderful children, and both Mrs. Jackson and Debbie Rowe were on the exact same page," McMillan said.
McMillan, in a statement issued Wednesday, said Katherine Jackson was not disputing the will.
But, he said, she wanted the judge to order the executors to disclose information about what he said was "a suspicious circle of relationships" involving them.
The oldest child -- Michael Joseph Jackson Jr., more commonly known as Prince Michael -- was born in February 1997.
A daughter -- Paris Michael Katherine Jackson -- was born the next year.
Rowe gave up parental rights to Jackson in 2001, but she changed her mind more than two years later and sought temporary custody of the children.
