In the wake of an alleged terrorist attack on one of its soldiers, Britain is forming a task force that will examine the dynamics behind extremist groups in the country, Prime Minister David Cameron's office announced Sunday.
"We must be vigilant and ensure we do not inadvertently give into the demands of all extremists: making our society less free, divided and suspicious of each other.
Nine people have been arrested in connection with the Woolwich attack, including three men who were taken into custody Saturday and another on Sunday.
The three arrested Saturday were released early Monday on bail, police said.
Britain's MI5 intelligence agency will report the results of a preliminary investigation into the suspects this week to the Intelligence and Security Committee, government sources said.
"We cannot allow this soldier's death to be in vain," Robinson said.
A counter demonstration drew a few hundred people, police said.
