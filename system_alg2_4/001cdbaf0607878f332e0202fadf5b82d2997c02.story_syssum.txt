(CNN) -- The big winners of this Formula One season could be road drivers rather than F1 racers, according to one former world champion.
The Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) has been used in F1 since 2009, but Scheckter says these latest advancements in the sport will only benefit everyday drivers.
On the track, Scheckter expects an unpredictable start to the championship as teams and drivers wrestle with the new regulations.
Hamilton, a world champion in 2008, set the fastest time on the final day of the final test event in Bahrain, but the quickest lap time of preseason was set by Felipe Massa of Williams.
"I would've thought after the fourth, fifth race, you might see things settle down.
"What they are trying to do is make it so the last race determines the championship," he said.
No it's not, but it makes exciting racing.
