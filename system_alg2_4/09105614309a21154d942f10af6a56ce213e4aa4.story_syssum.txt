(CNN) -- Living near Wrigley Field has always felt magical to diehard Chicago Cubs fan Deb Gordils, who was born and raised in Wrigleyville, just blocks away from the famed ballpark.
Gordils is one of many Chicagoans, baseball fans and historians who shared their memories and photos of the renowned ballpark with CNN iReport in honor of Wrigley Field turning 100 years old on April 23.
He said it's the same for Boston's Fenway Park, which celebrated 100 years in 2012.
Wrigley Field is integrated into the neighborhood," he said.
The Cubs' lack of success may have actually helped preserve the park as well, said Wrigley expert Stuart Shea.
And they didn't have a lot of attendance during that time," said Shea, who recently published an updated version of his book, "Wrigley Field: The Long Life and Contentious Times of the Friendly Confines."
"I loved knowing I was seeing the same sights, smelling the same smells, hearing the same sounds as every person who's attended a game at Wrigley over the last 100 years," he said.
"The one thing I worry about is that if new scoreboards were added, then that will reduce the city view, and you will lose the feel that makes it special.
I attended school blocks away from the ballpark, and today my kids go to school blocks from the ballpark and my office is near Wrigley," she said.
"It was really magical living around Wrigley field.
