Facing another boring day at work, a Toronto car repair shop worker decided some weed would be just the thing to make the day fly by.
The police forwarded the tweet to an account for a man listed on the board of directors for the repair shop chain.
First, defiance.
Big smh to all of y'all," said one tweet.
MANNNNNNNN."
"Just got the call of termination," tweeted the worker later that afternoon.
The York Regional Police explained in a later tweet, "If you shouted on a busy street corner about illegal activity & we drove by, we'd intervene.
The next day, the man deleted his account.
