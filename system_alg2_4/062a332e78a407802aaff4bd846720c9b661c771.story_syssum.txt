At the same time, a new report about the Syrian civil war showed what appears to be convincing evidence of large-scale "systematic torture and killing" by the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Iran's top ally.
Under the deal negotiated in November, Iran suspended some of its nuclear enrichment operations, and Western governments started lifting some of the economic sanctions they have used to pressure Tehran.
They will note that this was a week that showed the consequences of Iran's gradually rising influence, as the Islamic Republic moved steadily toward its goal of becoming the dominant power in the region.
It has become a proxy war for regional rivalries, with Sunni states, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, supporting the opposition, and Iran, along with Hezbollah, standing steadfastly with al-Assad by providing him with manpower, ammunition and intelligence.
The interim deal was meant to freeze the nuclear program in place for six months while a final agreement is negotiated.
The sight of top American and European diplomats rushing to Geneva to negotiate with Iran sent a strong message.
One reason Iran signed the interim deal is that it has already achieved a great deal of what it sought with its nuclear program.
In some respects, Iran is already a nuclear power, although it doesn't yet have the full immunity that nuclear weapons would create.
European, Asian and Arab businessmen are lining up to make deals with a resurgent Iran.
But already Iran and Syria have indicated they have no intention of supporting the meeting's official goal of creating a transitional government to end Syria's war.
The talks in Switzerland will now start.
Otherwise, the region will become an even more dangerous and desperate place, as we see today in Syria.
