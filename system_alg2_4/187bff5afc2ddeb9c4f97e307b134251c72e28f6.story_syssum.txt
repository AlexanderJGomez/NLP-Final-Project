Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- Nepalis went to the polls Tuesday amid tight security to elect an assembly that will draw up a new constitution.
"Except in a few places, elections are being held peacefully," police spokesman Ganesh K. C. said.
Earlier reports said that three people had been injured.
One person later died of injuries in hospital, police said.
The Maoists carried out a 10-year insurgency to abolish that system.
Two years later, in 2008, Nepal held elections for the first time.
