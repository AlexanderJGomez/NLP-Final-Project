"I'm in shock," he said.
"He was clearly an actor who followed his own path," said Leah Rozen, movie critic for People magazine.
Carradine was nominated for a Golden Globe for his role as folk music legend Woody Guthrie in the 1976 movie "Bound For Glory," according to a biography on his official Web site.
He was the son of actor John Carradine, a character actor who appeared in hundreds of films, plays and television episodes.
