And now, as the playoffs move to the final two rounds, Brodeur has a chance to win the Stanley Cup at an age when most players already have hung up their skates and picked up their golf clubs.
No goaltender in NHL history has won more games than Brodeur: His 656 career victories are 105 more than Patrick Roy, who is second on the list.
"You go out, and you compete against players that are such a young age," Brodeur said during the Devils' second-round series against the Flyers, which they won in five games.
It's been awesome for me."
When Brodeur won his first Stanley Cup, he was just 23.
Now, if the Devils continue their hot streak through the playoffs, he could win his fourth at 40.

"I remember in the playoffs, he once said he was facing more critics than shots," said Roy, who owns most of the NHL goaltending records that Brodeur doesn't have.
Brodeur is in the final year of his contract but has said he's leaning toward coming back next year -- his 20th in a Devils uniform -- "if they're going to take me back."
The 40-year-old goaltender is doing what's he's done for two decades now: winning hockey games.
"Couldn't find a big enough cake, I guess," he said with a laugh.
