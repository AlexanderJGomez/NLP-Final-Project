Here, his wife, Julie Chaffetz,  talks about how she copes with the challenges of her freshman year as a "congressional spouse."
No one makes you read the bills, but to do the job right, you must.
The real challenge for me is setting the work aside.
Through trial and error, Julie and I have learned some important strategies for making our family time count.
We married in February 1991.
Since Jason was elected to Congress, I have learned to adapt to many new challenges.
Although I'm not a perfect mother, I've got great kids who reward me with hugs, smiles, occasional pouts and late-night chats.
Planning is crucial.
She recommended that when Jason is in Washington, I spend time doing the things I need to do on my own, such as errands, volunteering, time with friends, helping with homework, and home projects like learning how to repair a toilet -- and yes, I mastered this skill!
My parents and siblings are settled everywhere from Minnesota to Arizona.
We have been laughing, counseling and spilling our guts to each other once a month for the past 16 years.
And we still manage to read good books, too.
I'm the CEO of Utah Chaffetz and lovin' it!
