Josh McDermitt: When I booked the role, I knew that Eugene wasn't a scientist, but I didn't know it was gonna come this season.
For it to happen that quickly, it will be fun to see where Eugene heads next -- if he's alive!
Eugene looks at himself as not having anything to offer to the group.
I don't know if I would lie like that, but I'm just happy I didn't get Daryl killed or anything -- then everyone would hate Eugene for sure.
I think that's where Eugene will want to go: "How do I get back into this group?
There's a little bit of hope for Eugene, but at this point he's a broken man, starting over.
I had to put it down for a while, because I was afraid I would influence it too much.
The character they had me reading had a mohawk.
I don't think we've had a good mullet on TV since Uncle Jesse from "Full House," so I'm glad to bring it back.
We'll see how the damage is repaired, and it's not pretty, I'll tell you that.
