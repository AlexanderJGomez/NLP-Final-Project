(CNN) -- Racing legend Frankie Dettori will work as a freelance jockey in 2013, ending an 18-year spell with the Dubai-owned Godolphin stable.
We have had many great days together and we look forward to working with Frankie in the future and hopefully enjoying more success together.
"Godolphin has been a major part of everything I have achieved in racing and I have loved every minute of it.
Arguably Dettori is most famous for riding seven different winners in one day at British racecourse Ascot in September 1996.
