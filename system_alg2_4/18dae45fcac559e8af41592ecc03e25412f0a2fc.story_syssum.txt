(CNN) -- Prince Albert of Monaco will tie the knot to former South African Olympic swimmer Charlene Wittstock next July, the palace announced Thursday.
"But I think it's -- it's so much your own timing and your own agenda and the person you want to be with."
Albert has two children from previous relationships -- a 6-year-old son born to Nicole Coste, a flight attendant from Togo, and an 18-year-old daughter born to American Tamara Rotolo, a former waitress.
It sits on the French Riviera and is bordered on three sides by France.
It has a population of about 33,000 people.
