Thirty-six officers from the Tucson, Arizona, Police Department are in Pittsburgh as part of the G-20 security force.
They were asked to assist by Pittsburgh officials as part of a Department of Homeland Security rapid response team.
The Arizona officers were asked to come to Pittsburgh after taking part in the protection effort at the Republican National Convention in 2008 in St. Paul, Minnesota.
"We're excited to be here.
The additional help protecting downtown locations "gives Pittsburgh the flexibility to send its officers where needed," Sayre said.
