(CNN) -- Negotiating teams from Sudan and South Sudan have agreed to end a dispute on oil payments to allow the resumption of southern oil exports through Sudan's territories, Sudan's state-run Ashorooq TV reported early Saturday, citing official sources.
While most of the oil wells are in the south, the pipelines and port to export the oil are in the north.
The negotiating teams agreed that Sudan will receive $25.80 per barrel that passes through pipelines from the south to the north as an export tax and refining cost, Ashorooq TV reported.
The South Sudan state of Upper Nile has been flooded with refugees crossing the border from Sudan.
