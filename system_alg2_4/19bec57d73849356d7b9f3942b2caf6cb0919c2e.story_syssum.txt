Vancouver, British Columbia (CNN) -- Many kids dream of being in the Olympics one day.
He stole from people; he ate from garbage cans; he got locked up in juvenile detention for breaking into a bike shop when he was trying to get something he could sell for money so he could eat.
"I knew that there was something better," Schuffenhauer, 36, said last week as he readied for his third Olympic Games.
She lived in the town of Roy, Utah, about 30 minutes north of Salt Lake City.
"She reminded me to never give up and always push on," he said.
Track and field was to be a turning point; he had real friends now and the parents of one of his teammates eventually would adopt him.
An oft-injured ankle failed him again, and hurting so bad he couldn't walk, he had to give up on his dream of going to Sydney.
His conversion to bobsledder came thanks to a friend who told him there was a new track in Park City where the U.S. team was training for the 2002 Winter Olympics.
Supporting a family on the meager money bobsledders get was impossible, and it was time to find a job and settle down in Utah.
He and Savage had to solve a dilemma: either he would give up on the idea of another Olympics or he would go back to full-time training with the team.
"It's been amazing that she's been able to stand by me," he said of Savage, now his fianc√©e.
The bank kicked them out, and Savage and the kids moved into a rental while Schuffenhauer went away for seven months at a time.
But with the economy in free fall, he barely sold any tickets.
He worked closely with a chiropractor and a team physician to get back on track.
I'm here.
It is improbable his team will medal in the four-man competition, which begins Friday.
After the Games, Schuffenhauer plans to return home, find work, take online classes towards a sports science degree and move to the next chapter of his life.
Asked if those chapters will take written form one day, he said he had considered it, but right now he has a family to return to.
