The profile changes will be part of a wider launch, one that will include launch of a music and media platform.
However, we've also learned that the platform -- which will include music and video from partner sites -- will display the media content a user is watching or listening to on their profiles.
We don't exactly know what that means, but we've heard whispers that Facebook intends to give Facebook Credits more prominence.
What do you think Facebook will launch on Thursday?
