(CNN) -- What do you get when you combine a hotel and a boat?
Now the oldest ferry boat in the country has a permanent home moored on the Hudson River -- and a psychedelic new interior.
Today Lilla has a much gentler existence, permanently moored in the quiet fishing town of Harlingen in the northern Netherlands.
The renovated 14-meter boat includes a double bedroom, dining room and two-person wooden bath.
History buffs can experience life as a World War II sailor -- without the combat -- aboard the historic USS Silversides submarine.
Guests can also take part in a Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) design class, including lessons on building their own underwater robot.
The building is based on the Roi des Belges, the riverboat that author Joseph Conrad sailed up the Congo in 1889, and later used as the inspiration behind his famous book Heart of Darkness.
"With its combination of painted wood and hand-worked gold and silver coated metals, it seems to echo the simplicity of a Japanese tea-hut or the rural haphazard quality of a midwestern farm building," said organizers.
