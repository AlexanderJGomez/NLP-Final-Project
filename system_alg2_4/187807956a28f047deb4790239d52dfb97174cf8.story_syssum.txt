(CNN) -- Despite a recall, millions of people may continue taking a generic form of Lipitor that might contain specks of glass.
A Food and Drug Administration spokeswoman couldn't explain why the recall didn't direct consumers to stop taking the drug even though patients might have received the contaminated pills.
"It makes my palms sweat just thinking about it."
Consumer Reports is advising consumers to take potentially contaminated medicine back to the pharmacy and request another brand, Gill said.
The FDA has accused the company of "a pattern of systemic fraudulent conduct," including taking shortcuts in crucial quality tests.
