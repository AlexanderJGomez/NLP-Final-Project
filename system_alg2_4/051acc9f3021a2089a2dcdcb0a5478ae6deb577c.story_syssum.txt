(CNN) -- The Miami Heat went cold after 27 consecutive winning games and failed to match the 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers' winning streak of 33.
If the Pats won that game, they would have joined the 1972 Dolphins as the only NFL teams to have a perfect season.
After the game, Rose, still 12 games away from Joe DiMaggio's major-league record, fumed that Garber didn't throw fastballs to strike him out.
-The Detroit Lions made a run during the 2008-2009 season at the record for most consecutive games lost.
The embattled team lost 23 straight games at the end of the 2011-12 season.
