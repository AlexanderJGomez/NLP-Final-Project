The first Iraq war combat veteran to serve in the U.S. Senate introduced legislation on Thursday aimed at reducing the number of military veterans who commit suicide.
"Far too often, we're leaving our veterans to fight their toughest battles alone," Walsh said.
The Suicide Prevention for America's Veterans Act is collaboration between Walsh and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.
Among the bill's key objectives is to give veterans more time to receive mental health treatment.
Currently, when a service member separates from active duty -- whether they are transitioning to being a veteran or becoming a Reservist or a member of the National Guard -- they have five years to receive care from the Department of Veterans Affairs, O'Gorman said.
To address that, Walsh's bill would extend the time to receive mental health treatment from five years to 15 years.
It also calls for annual reviews of care programs within the Defense Department and the VA to ensure resources are being used effectively to help service members and vets struggling with mental health issues.
Currently, they use different drug prescription protocols, Walsh and military experts told CNN, and that can create a difficult situation.
Walsh is waiting for the Congressional Budget Office to provide a figure, she said.
But the senator stressed that it will cost far more in years to come if changes are not made soon to improve mental health care.
The Iraq and Afghanistan wars are the longest continuous battles the United States has fought.
President Barack Obama has said that the United States could withdraw all troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014.
A large body of research indicates PTSD is associated with increased likelihood of suicidal behavior.
Walsh said lawmakers must also address suicides amongst military family members, too.
Warrior suicides and military family member suicides are "connected," Walsh said.
The relatives have made "enormous sacrifices," he said.
