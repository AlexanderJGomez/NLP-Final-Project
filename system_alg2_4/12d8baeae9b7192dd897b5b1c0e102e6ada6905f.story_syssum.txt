The coming weeks ahead will be the toughest for these countries in the Sahel -- the stretch of African countries including Niger, Chad, Mali and Mauritania -- as they make their way into the rainy season and scrape by with the little food they have since last year's harvest, officials said.
"We have now six weeks until it is agreed we will be out of the severe danger zone and the ramp-up has to happen not in a few weeks but now, before this very difficult time," Sheeran said.
In Chad, thousands of children are suffering from severe acute malnutrition.
The centers "will be placed strategically in the most vulnerable areas where we're seeing the highest rates of acute malnutrition," said Sheeran.
"What we need now is urgent action from international leaders and donors to make sure that people have access to food now and in the future," Rooijmans said.
