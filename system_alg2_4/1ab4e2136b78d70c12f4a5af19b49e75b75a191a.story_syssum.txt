(CNN) -- Even by the standards of supercars, and nearly a decade after it was first introduced, the Porsche Carrera GT is something remarkable.
It sounds like a race car engine -- indeed, it pretty much is, having originally been created for a Le Mans program that Porsche subsequently cancelled.
Yet as soon as the Carrera GT is moving, it starts to feel far more normal.
Start to go faster and the Carrera GT shows a far harder edge to its personality.
Porsche claims the GT can blast from 0-60mph in 3.5 seconds, and from 0-100mph in just 6.9 seconds.
The vast tyres offer huge grip: you can drive the GT quicker than pretty much anything else without ever finding its limits.
Most drivers will be able to drive the GT considerably quicker if they leave the system on, but turning it off does reveal another side to the car's character -- with what can be a sudden transition from the car gripping to sliding.
Even experienced drivers like Anthony Hamilton, father of Formula 1 racer Lewis, have crashed Carrera GTs, and Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson has described it as having a "savagery that's hard to explain."
