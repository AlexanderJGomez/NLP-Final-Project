(CNN) -- Brian Flynn, brother of a victim aboard downed Pan Am Flight 103, said Thursday that the killing of former Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi is a moment of justice.
Flynn's brother, John Patrick, was one of 35 university students killed in the tragedy.
"This is one of those situations that when (John Patrick Flynn) died, I said I promised him and myself that I wouldn't let it go, that there would be justice," he told CNN.
"Part of me thinks this story had to end this way," Flynn added, referring to the former Libyan leader's being killed rather than captured.
He was set free on compassionate grounds because he was battling prostate cancer.
But a Libyan envoy said the new government is not likely to send him back.
For others, Gadhafi's killing also likely marks an end to more than two decades of documenting the Lockerbie tragedy.
