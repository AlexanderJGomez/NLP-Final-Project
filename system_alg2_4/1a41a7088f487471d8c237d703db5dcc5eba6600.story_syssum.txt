(CNN) -- American technology pioneer John McAfee said he faked a heart attack while detained in Guatemala to buy time for his attorney to file a series of appeals that ultimately prevented his deportation to Belize, hastening the government's decision to send him back to the United States.
"This is not about a murder in Belize.
"He opted to return to his country of origin," said attorney Telesforo Guerra, who has represented McAfee since he arrived in Guatemala last week.
Authorities in Belize, where McAfee had lived since 2008, say they want to talk to him about Faull's death.
McAfee's home on Ambergris Caye, an island off Belize's mainland, was raided after Faull's death.
