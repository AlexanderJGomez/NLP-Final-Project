HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN)  -- Deaths in Zimbabwe related to the cholera epidemic are approaching 2,000, the World Health Organization said Tuesday, and close to 40,000 people have been affected by the preventable water-borne disease.
Most residents have resorted to rivers and shallow wells for drinking water, because taps are usually dry.
Last month, Mugabe's government declared the cholera epidemic a national emergency.
Zimbabwean Health Minister David Parirenyatwa warned this month that the epidemic could get worse as the rainy season develops.
The sides continue to debate the sharing of key Cabinet ministries such as information, local government, finance, defense and home affairs.
