The practices documented "are among the most serious human rights violations under international law, are crimes under Afghan law and are strictly prohibited under both Afghan and international law," the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) says in the report.
UNAMA documented one death in government custody due to torture in April 2011, the report says.
are methods that are absolutely non-existent in the NDS (National Directorate of Security)," the government said.
UNAMA said officials with Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security "systematically tortured detainees in a number of detention facilities across Afghanistan.
"In almost every case, NDS officials stopped the use of torture once detainees confessed to the crime of which they were accused or provided the requested information."
Canada and the United Kingdom ceased transfers of detainees to facilities in Kandahar and Kabul at various times based on reports of torture and ill treatment, the report said.
UNAMA took steps to ensure that the information it collected was credible, the report said.
We are happy that this report also testifies in a part that torture did not take place in a systematic manner in all NDS headquarters."
