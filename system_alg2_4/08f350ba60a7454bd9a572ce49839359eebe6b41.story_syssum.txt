(CNN) -- "Borderlands 2" wants to raise the stakes and improve upon its signature art style and outlandish weapons while broadening the story on the planet of Pandora.
Working together, the two different types of weapons created a consistent kill zone for creatures -- no matter how strong or numerous they were.
The art style remains the same as in the original, with its familiar hand-painted look and dark outlines.
Just like you would see in a comic book," Varnell said.
Varnell said bringing an antagonist to the plot gave the team more options to make the story personal for the players.
he said.
Varnell said giving the players a focus also helps flesh out the game's characters and what motivates them.
Senior producer Sean Reardon echoed those sentiments and said community involvement in the first title and its three downloadable updates was important in figuring out what gamers liked and what worked best.
Little refinements, he hopes, will make the gameplay and the experience even more enjoyable for fans of the franchise as well as new players who are seeing Pandora for the first time.
More than 200 unique types of creatures will be in the way of players as they work their way through the game quests and other missions.
The player characters from "Borderlands" will also show up in the new game as nonplayer characters, providing backstory and missions for the gamers to complete.
