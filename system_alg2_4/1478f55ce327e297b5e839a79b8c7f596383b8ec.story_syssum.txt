When Beckham announced his decision to retire from football Thursday, there was one man who had already anticipated such an event.
"I think that being away from his family, them being in London and him being in Paris, was difficult for him.
I just had a feeling he might retire."
"It is only for a short time, but it's difficult being away from the children every single day.
"The kids have moved across the world and I think he wanted them to have some stability," added Clement.
"It was great to have him around and talk, but I've got my family here and that's been so good for me.
"He's just a normal guy," said Clement.
"For me, it was great that he was there just after Nick died because that was an awful time.
For somebody so famous, he's just a normal guy.
But he might have been a bit-part player next season or had to move to another club and I think he wanted to go out at the very top.
While Beckham will curtail his time in Paris at the end of the season, Clement hopes to remain to continue his work alongside manager Carlo Ancelotti.
"It's nice to work with good players," said Clement.
