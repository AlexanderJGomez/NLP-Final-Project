Washington (CNN) -- House Appropriations Committee Chairman David Obey, a senior member of the congressional Democratic leadership, announced Wednesday that he is not seeking re-election this November.
But there is a time to stay and a time to go, and this is my time to go," Obey said in announcing his decision.
But even more frankly, I am bone tired," he said.
"Well, now it has, and I can leave with the knowledge that thanks to Speaker Pelosi and President Obama and so many others, we got the job done.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee praised Obey as a "tireless voice for progress on behalf of his constituents in Wisconsin and middle class families across America" and disputed the notion that his job was at risk.
"Chairman Obey would have won re-election again had he run.
"Let me put it this way -- I have won 25 elections," Obey said.
Obey said he believes the job of a good politician is to be "used up" fighting for causes one believes in, and then stepping aside to let someone else carry on the battle.
