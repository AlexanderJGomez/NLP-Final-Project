The 36-year-old from Atlanta, Georgia, said he tried to convert his analog TV to digital but was turned down for a government coupon.
On June 12, analog TV signals will end and only digital signals will remain.
People with cable TV or satellite service will not be affected.
More than 6.5 million U.S. households, or 5.7 percent, were not ready for the crossover last month, according to an estimate from the Nielsen Company.
"I live here by myself, so it will be a big deal for me," said Monica Lawson, a 42-year-old from rural Alto, Georgia.
Lawson said she got a coupon to buy the digital converter box for her analog television as soon as they became available.
She falls into a category of people who may lose their TV coverage with the switch to digital.
On the whole, studies show more people will get TV signals than will lose them in the switch to digital, Ingram said.
Congress elected to delay the digital switch in part because lawmakers don't want people to go without TV.
Like Touchine, more than 12 percent of New Mexico households in the Santa Fe and Albuquerque TV market are not ready for the switch, making the area the least prepared in the nation, according to Nielsen.
Richter said he left a bad job as a local truck driver four years ago and hasn't been able to find steady work since.
"I do have a radio and I also have a cell phone.
If Richter eventually gets a free converter box, he'll consider joining the digital TV world.
He thinks he might be better off without all that extra noise.
