(CNN) -- Nine Peruvian miners emerged into the daylight Wednesday morning after six days trapped in a collapsed mine.
Peruvian President Ollanta Humala greeted the miners at the mouth of the mine.
Humala's government has made a push for illegal mines and miners in Peru to be formalized and regulated so that risks decrease.
After the rescue, he made a similar argument.
All those miners were rescued, pulled one by one from hundreds of meters beneath the Earth's surface with a specially designed capsule.
