It's almost insulting to say the obvious, but there are plenty of women who know their sports, too.

The show is captured live at sports clubs and restaurants across the Atlanta metro area, with additional time in the studio to create produced segments to add to the mix.

"Men don't think women understand sports."
I just hope we get more women talking about sports."
