Slidell, Louisiana (CNN) -- Authorities dropped a mandatory evacuation order Sunday for neighborhoods threatened by a strained lock on a southeast Louisiana canal, but still recommended people stay away.
The river has been swollen by rain from last week's Hurricane Isaac, forcing authorities to relieve pressure on the structure by releasing water Saturday and Sunday.
That will result in "major flooding" of at least two subdivisions near the banks and threaten areas in the southeastern corner of the parish, according to the National Weather Service.

"Certainly, it helped some locations in our far eastern counties in Oklahoma, but there was very little beneficial rain," said Pete Snyder, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Tulsa.
Parts of Missouri and Illinois saw up to six inches of rain Saturday, and the National Weather Service issued a flood warning Sunday for parts of southern Illinois.
Isaac is blamed for at least 19 deaths in Haiti and at least four more in Louisiana and Mississippi after making landfall last week as a Category 1 hurricane -- on the seventh anniversary of Hurricane Katrina -- near the mouth of the Mississippi River.
In Plaquemines Parish, near the mouth of the Mississippi River, homes and businesses flooded after a parish-maintained back levee failed.
"Clothes, my laptop, a bunch of baby stuff, pictures," all ruined, she told CNN affiliate WLOX.
