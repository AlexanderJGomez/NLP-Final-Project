LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- Police and soldiers killed at least 133 people during two days of riots between Muslims and Christians in Nigeria last year, Human Rights Watch alleged Monday.
"I saw them enter one house just across the street from us," the unnamed witness said.
Another witness described police units going from house to house, summarily executing unarmed men and boys.
One of them said, 'Today you go die,' and then he shot him in the side.
Police then returned and shot tear gas into the neighbor's house, he testified.
The shopkeeper "died a short time later," the neighbor said.
Police and soldiers responded to the riots with deadly force, on the same day the governor of the state issued a "shoot-on-sight" order, Human Rights Watch said.
The rights group said the state commission examining the riots should investigate and call for the prosecution of security forces involved.
Human Rights Watch estimates that more than 1,000 people were killed in riots in 2001.
