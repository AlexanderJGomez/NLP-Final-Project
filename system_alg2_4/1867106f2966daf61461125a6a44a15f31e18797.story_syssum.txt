Today, soccer is the second favorite sport for those 12 to 24 years old.
The U.S. Men's National team has qualified for seven consecutive World Cups.
Total attendance at soccer matches in the U.S. in 2013 exceeded 10 million, according to attendance figures compiled by U.S. Soccer.
Our country has become the largest market in the world for international matches, according to the U.S. Soccer Federation, the governing body for the game in the United States.
The U.S. Soccer Foundation is working to provide thousands of children and families in under-resourced communities with easy and affordable access to quality soccer programming and safe places to play.
