Comanche, arguably the world's most hotly-anticipated yacht, has finally taken to the seas and for its billionaire owner Jim Clark, it's a chunk of money that could land him a place in the record books.

But if we get into the record books -- and we believe we will - then it's job done."
"My wife's an Australian and a very competitive lady," says Clark, "and she wants to sail in Sydney-Hobart.
