After all, he brought heat during the chilliest parts of the Cold War and had the requisite women and weapons.
Now, Bond is proving that he still has a place at MI6 by tackling a much more modern dilemma: tactical cyberespionage and terrorism.
Shaking disbelief: One of the standout moments in "Skyfall" is the film's opening sequence in which Bond, played for the third time by Daniel Craig, and field operative Eve, played by Naomie Harris, chase a man through the streets of Istanbul.
But how likely would it be for a terrorist to obtain and store this information in one place?
He had everything in one place.
Still, it's unlikely that he would be able to have all of this information in one place.
Stirring reality: Wright said many critical infrastructures are connected to Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems, controlling our electricity grid, water, and sewers, and are therefore are a huge soft target for terrorism.
Would it be possible for Silva to access something like a train, and how much control could he actually have over it?
Wright said.
This leads them to the final battle in a place called Skyfall, which fans of Ian Fleming's books know as a very personal place for Bond.
"There's actually a term for this in the computer world called 'Honeypots'," he said.
By doing so, Wright and his team were able to see the latest techniques being used and which vulnerabilities cyberterrorists were willing to exploit.
In the case of the latest film from the 50-year-old Bond franchise, it's safe to assume who comes out on top.
