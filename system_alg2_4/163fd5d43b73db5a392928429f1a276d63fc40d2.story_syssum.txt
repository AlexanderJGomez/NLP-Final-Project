Beijing (CNN) -- Vladimir Putin is seeking China's support in Russia's standoff with Western powers over Ukraine.
Qin did not criticize Russia for sending troops into Ukrainian territory but he repeated China's call for dialogue to resolve the standoff.
Spokesman Qin's equivocation shows the delicate balance China is trying to strike to maintain good relations with Russia without alienating itself completely from the United States and Europe.
As for Washington's strategic partnership with China, it had been rooted largely in a shared enmity toward a common enemy -- the Soviet Union.
"In the past, China and Russia have often worked together to block international action (often led by the West) to address global crises, by claiming their respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty," said Paul Haenle, director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center of Global Policy in Beijing, noting their recent veto of sanctions against the Syrian regime.
China has supported Russia in its sphere of influence, such as in the Syrian crisis, expecting that Russia would support China's interests in Asia, on issues such as North Korea.
"China does not want to take a position that will haunt it domestically," said a Chinese analyst who declined to be identified because he is not authorized to speak on the record on the topic.
China is also Ukraine's military industry's largest customer; China bought its first aircraft carrier from Ukraine."
"Ukraine will need China's economic cooperation, whether it's a friend of the EU and the U.S., or of Russia," said Wenfang Tang, of the University of Iowa.
