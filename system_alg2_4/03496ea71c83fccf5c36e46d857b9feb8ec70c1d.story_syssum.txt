(CNN) -- Nearly four decades after hundreds of people were led to their deaths in a mass murder-suicide pact in a South American jungle, the cremated remains of nine of those victims have been found in a shuttered funeral home in Delaware.
Nine of the marked containers held the remains of Jonestown massacre victims, Chandler said.
Chandler said she did not know the connection between the funeral home and the military base.
The discovery prompted Delaware authorities to conduct an exploratory excavation on the property on Wednesday.
The markers were to be presented to family members or returned to the Veterans Administration.
But Jones sent gunmen to a nearby airstrip, where they killed Ryan, an NBC correspondent and his cameraman, a newspaper photographer and one of the departing family members.
Syringes were used to squirt the poison in the mouths of babies.
It is not known who shot him or whether he shot himself.
