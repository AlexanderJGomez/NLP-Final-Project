So how do you become a Davos delegate?
Unless you're an anchor for one of the many broadcasters covering the event; an academic; a faith leader; a Young Global Leader (young people with great potential selected by the WEF from all fields of business); a social entrepreneur; or from an NGO, the average cost to a business to send each delegate is close to a whopping $20,000.
And once in Zurich there's the small matter of the transfer to Davos.
However corporate CEOs may choose to come by helicopter, which costs around $9,500 for a return flight.
A chalet sleeping up to ten people for the week can command as much as 60,000 Swiss Francs ($63,600) - though catering might just be included.
It is not uncommon to see $2,000 bespoke suits finished off with bulky snow boots around the Congress Center.
$40,000-per head well spent.
