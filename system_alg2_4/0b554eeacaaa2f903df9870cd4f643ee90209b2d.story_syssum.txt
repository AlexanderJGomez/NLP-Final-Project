London (CNN) -- During the 1970s, Britain's car industry was the sick man of Europe: many models were poorly designed and built, politicians and the nationalized company management lacked strategic vision while workers were often on strike.
Rolls-Royce spokesman Andrew Ball told CNN the company was profitable but declined to detail any figures.
The booming Rolls-Royce sales figures come days after its former sister company, Bentley, posted a 37% rise in global sales, also on the back of rising sales to China and the U.S.
Between 2001 and 2011 there were only 133,000 workers in the industry, but they produced 16.1 million cars.
They see sales rising from 12.8 million in 2011 to between 13.5 million to 14 million this year and close to 15 million by 2014 or 2015.
The Rolls-Royce brand was doing well, he said, because it married British heritage with BMW's sales and marketing expertise.
Industry analyst Paul Nieuwenhuis said that while many customers bought luxury cars "by the meter" -- that is to say they care more about the image than the machine -- modern Rolls-Royce cars were exceptional vehicles.
He added that the Rolls-Royce sales figures showed that "rich people still have money" especially in China.
The rights to use the Rolls-Royce name have been owned by BMW since 1998 when Vickers sold off Rolls-Royce Motors, which also made Bentley cars.
