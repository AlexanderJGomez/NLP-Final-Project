(CNN) -- Waking up Tuesday to the news that my good friend and former team mate Phil Hughes was in a critical state in hospital after a blow to the head in a state cricket match made me instantly realize how fragile life can be.
A strong, energetic person, he has transformed much of my thinking about the game -- and even my life.
He was carefree yet deeply focused and hungry; I loved being around all that energy.
We made an odd couple.
My thoughts tracked back to the life of Ayrton Senna, arguably the most naturally gifted racing driver of all-time.
And then this happens to Phil -- left in a critical state.
Cricket is essentially a team sport but the life of a top order batsmen can be isolated and lonely.
Just you and your thoughts.
I have faced 95 mph balls from a bowling machine off 18 yards in an indoor hall, with the lights turned off, and felt horrendous.
I've always prided myself on the way I play short pitch stuff but that day the angle of delivery, coupled with some foggy processing, did for me.
So seeing Phil fall flat on his face like that was spine chilling.
But for a ball to almost find its way through, under the helmet, behind the ear, and to cause that sort of damage is unheard of.
Our thoughts are with Phil and his family.
I feel desperate thinking of everyone -- the love and adoration for him is overwhelming to see.
