The indictment charges Portillo with embezzling tens of millions of dollars in public funds, "a portion of which he then laundered through bank accounts located, among other places, in the United States and Europe," the indictment says.
Portillo was the president of Guatemala from 2000 to 2004.
That money was eventually laundered into his family's accounts in Europe, the court document states.
There was a second instance where Portillo allegedly embezzled money given to Guatemala by the Taiwanese, according to the document.
Some of the money that Portillo took went to buy expensive watches and cars, the indictment says.
