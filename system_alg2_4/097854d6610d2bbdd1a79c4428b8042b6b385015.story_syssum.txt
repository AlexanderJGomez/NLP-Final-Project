Pilot Sam Egli took John Paskievitch, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, and Lopez, a post-doctoral researcher, about 6,500 feet up the volcano on Wednesday.
Some volcanic earthquakes quakes are caused by moving magma, water or gas, Lopez said.
"We grabbed our stuff and got in the helicopter," Lopez said, but even in the few minutes that took visibility became too poor for takeoff.
On Thursday, rescuers circled overhead but could not land.
"Even though it wasn't that cold, it was pretty foul when you were outside," Lopez said.
Paskievitch wasn't available to talk Saturday -- because he was back out on the mountain.
Lopez said he hoped to check on the condition of the helicopter, where the researchers had to leave their instruments.
