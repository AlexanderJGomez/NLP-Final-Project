An autopsy was conducted Monday in the Bahamas on the body of the couple's son, Jett Travolta.
The autopsy results have not been released, but employees of the funeral home that handled the remains said "seizure" was listed as the cause of death on the death certificate, celebrity Web site TMZ reported.
The funeral home said "The body was in great condition and shows no sign of head trauma," TMZ reported.
The body was cremated, Wilchcombe said Monday.
Jett Travolta had a developmental disability that his parents have linked to Kawasaki disease, an inflammatory disorder of the artery walls that most commonly occurs in young children, and that can lead to heart disease.
"They're just a fantastic couple, very family oriented like a lot of people in our community," Ocala Mayor Randy Ewers, told Larry King.
We're all one family here, you know.
