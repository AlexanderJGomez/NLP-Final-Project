"The whole bridge from one side of the Mississippi to the other just completely gave way, fell all the way down," survivor Gary Babineau told CNN.
"I realized there was a school bus right next to me, and me and a couple of other guys went over and started lifting the kids off the bridge.
I think there were some broken bones."
Ambulances were also having a hard time driving down to the river to get closer to the scene.
"I could see the whole bridge as it was going down, as it was falling," Babineau said.
Babineau said the rear of his pickup truck was dangling over the edge of a broken-off section of the bridge.
I saw a couple cars fall," he said.
He said most of the children were crying or screaming.
Melissa Hughes, 32, of Minneapolis, told The Associated Press that she was driving home when the western edge of the bridge collapsed under her.
"It's really very surreal."
Babineau told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune: "On the way down, I thought I was dead.
After the bridge settled and his car remained upright, "I just put in park, turned the key off and said, 'Oh, I'm alive,' " he said.
