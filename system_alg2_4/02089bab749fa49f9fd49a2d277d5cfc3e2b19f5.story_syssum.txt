LIMA, Peru (CNN) -- The government of Peru on Friday declared a state of emergency in a remote northern area after a clash between police and indigenous people protesting what they say is the exploitation of their native lands left a number of people dead.
Foreign Minister Jose A. Garcia Belaunde told CNN en Espa√±ol that the state of emergency was ordered to give the government the opportunity to re-establish order and reopen talks with the protesters.
But Alberto Pizango, the principal leader of the indigenous group, said his followers could not have been responsible for killing any police, because they were armed only with stones and arrows.
"These people don't have crowns," he said about the protesters.
Garcia called Pizango a criminal.
