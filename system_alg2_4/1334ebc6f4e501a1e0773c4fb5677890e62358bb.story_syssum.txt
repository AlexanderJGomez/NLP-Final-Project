But many were disappointed by the countless features the smart watch did not include.
But does it really deliver on its promise?
"I'm waiting for a smart watch that does something extra than just bring my phone to my wrist," says design engineer Esben Oxholm, who mocked up his own smart watch concept in February.
Christoph Behling, lead designer for Tag Heuer watches, shared Oxholm's criticisms, saying that in his view the Galaxy Gear will not serve as a replacement for regular watches, because it is lacking in two fundamental aspects: both in its form and its function.
Equally, he thinks that its rather industrial looking design, with exposed screws and a metallic finish will win few fans: "They didn't really engage with the idea that the watch is an accessory.
Others say that the smart watch proper still hasn't been invented.
Many now rest their hopes on Apple to deliver the device they are waiting for, with countless speculative designs being proffered by the vast community of "Macolytes."
