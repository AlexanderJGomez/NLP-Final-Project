Harry Potter Alliance members attend a midnight screening in Burlington, Massachusetts.
Slack is the executive director of the Harry Potter Alliance, a nonprofit organization dedicated to engaging Potter fans in social activism.
In the "Potter" books, "implications toward public policy are profound," Slack said.
Slack sees parallels between the magic in the "Potter" books and expanding one's mind to come up with solutions in a creative way.
Earlier this year, the Harry Potter Alliance conducted a book drive for children around the world, an effort led by "Potter" actress Evanna Lynch.
"Potter" author J.K. Rowling has many times compared Voldemort to Adolf Hitler.
The campaign takes Dumbledore's ethics and beliefs and translates them to the real world.
Rowling herself has praised the Harry Potter Alliance, one of Slack's proudest moments.
Rowling has also written personally to Slack about his efforts.
This year, 52 such "Can't Stop the Serenity" screenings are taking place around the world for charities such as the human rights organization Equality Now!, in response to a challenge by the film's director Joss Whedon.
Members of the Harry Potter Alliance, 4,500 of whom make up the most hardcore group, are inspired by what it has done.
Some bloggers have criticized the group for taking their fandom too far or using young fans' love of Harry Potter to promote an agenda.
"There have been some interesting debates over whether or not Dumbledore would be an activist," he said, mentioning that some see Dumbledore as "teaching through living."
"There are issues I didn't know much about or hadn't thought about too deeply that I'm now involved in, like Darfur," Bolton said.
