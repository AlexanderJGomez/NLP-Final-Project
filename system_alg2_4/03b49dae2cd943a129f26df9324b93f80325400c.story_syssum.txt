London (CNN) -- After pleas to spare the life of British aid worker Alan Henning went unanswered by the so-called Islamic State terror group, his family is "numb with grief" with the news that he has been beheaded.
That is not to be."
UK Prime Minister David Cameron called Henning's murder "absolutely abhorrent" and "completely unforgiveable," saying Britain must work with its allies to defeat ISIS.
The news of Henning's beheading came just days after Britain joined the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS, following overwhelming approval from Parliament.
ISIS then claimed its first British victim, aid worker David Haines, according to video that appeared online on September 13.
When she was unable to reach those who sent the file, she made public pleas last month to ISIS to spare her husband's life -- an appeal joined by voices of Muslim leaders around the world.
His interest was in the welfare of others," Barbara Henning said in the statement.
At a ceremony at Manchester Central Mosque on Saturday, a joint statement mourning the loss of Henning was read out on behalf of mosques throughout the north of England.
UK authorities believe at least 500 British citizens have gone to Iraq and Syria, many of them to fight with ISIS and other Islamist groups -- and that most will try to return, bringing their extremist views with them.
