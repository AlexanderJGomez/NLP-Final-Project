It's among 17 "concept cars" on exhibit at Atlanta, Georgia's High Museum of Art.
When you first walk into the exhibit, it's clear these cars aren't designed for mere mortals.
Collectible car sales last year in the U.S. topped $1 billion.
"These have got to be some of the world's craziest, beautiful cars," a visitor says to me with a grin as big as the grill-work on a stunning '51 GM LeSabre XP-8 sitting a few feet away.
VERY.
It looks like something out of Disney's "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea."
"You can fetishize just about any detail on the Bugatti you like, from the grill to every bolt," a man standing nearby says to me.
These vehicles were designed to look like the future.
"In the past, the future was really cool," joked Gross, who's also been Playboy Magazine's car writer for more than 25 years.
Gross, the exhibit's consulting curator, says these vehicles were imagined and built by designers with one goal: to get attention.
This rolling rocket gets its own chamber in the exhibit.
-- It's the first two-section gas turbine powered car to be built and tested in the U.S.
The car "was so fast they only had one or two engineers who drove it at the proving grounds," Gross says.
The Atlanta museum is by no means the first to celebrate automobile design.
Maybe increased interest within America's art community will stoke the fire, and keep the romance burning a little longer.
