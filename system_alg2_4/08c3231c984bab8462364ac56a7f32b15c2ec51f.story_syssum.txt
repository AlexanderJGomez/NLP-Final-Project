Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan checked into a California rehab center early Friday, ending -- at least for now -- a drama that has had more twists and turns than a high-speed car chase.
Lohan, 26, "wants to settle in" for a few days while arrangements can be made to transfer her to the Lukens Institute in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, which bills itself as a "luxury rehab center," Michael Lohan said.
Michael Lohan said he was not happy with it either because of the revelation that the facility -- Morningside Recovery in Newport Beach -- can't provide alcohol and drug rehab treatments because California officials revoked its license.
It's unclear whether Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Dabney knew Morningside was unlicensed when Lohan's lawyer, Mark Heller, informed him in court Thursday morning that she would spend her rehab sentence there.
"Lindsay had no idea that Morningside wasn't approved," Michael Lohan said.
The judge ordered the treatment after Lohan entered pleas of no contest on charges relating to a traffic accident and, with those convictions, she was found in violation of her shoplifting probation.
The actress has appeared in court at least 20 times before four Los Angeles judges who have now found her in violation of probation six times and sentenced her to a total of nine months in jail.
Lohan has spent about two weeks behind bars in six trips to the Los Angeles County jail, served 35 days under house arrest and worked about 67 days of community service at the county morgue.
