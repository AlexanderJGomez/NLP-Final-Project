Hawking, on the other hand, has lived more than 40 years since he learned he had the disease, which is also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease in America and motor neuron disease, or MND, in the United Kingdom.
Bob Hawkins, 75, of Fayetteville, North Carolina, who learned of his ALS diagnosis last year, said Hawking, with his long life and ability to communicate through a voice synthesizer, gives him hope.
This empowerment theme is part of the mission of the ALS Association, she said.
The disease causes the death of motor neurons, meaning the brain loses its ability to control muscle movement.
People typically are between 40 and 70 when they learn they have ALS; Hawking found out at age 21.
ALS affects 350,000 people worldwide and up to 30,000 people in the United States, the ALS Association estimates.
"It slowly takes over your entire muscle structure and eventually your limbs are affected, your speech may or may not be affected.
People with ALS may also find it difficult to lift their arms or feet, Matland said.
The nature of the disease is that it's very different in each person, she said.
Drugs in these trials include lithium, ceftriaxone, and memantine, according to the ALS Association.
In the UK, the MND Association is funding a trial for lithium, which has produced promising results in mice, Barry said.
Hawkins said he will be participating in the 2009 Fayetteville, North Carolina, Walk to Defeat ALS in May.
"I would encourage everyone to recognize how terrible this disease is, and encourage them to support the ALS Association and research projects," he said.
