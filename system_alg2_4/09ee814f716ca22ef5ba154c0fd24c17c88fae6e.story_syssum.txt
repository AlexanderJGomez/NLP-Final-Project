Phil Spector's first murder trial in 2007 ended in a mistrial as jurors said they couldn't reach a verdict.
Fidler denied a motion for a new trial by defense attorney Doron Weinberg, who said he would file an appeal.
"The evidence did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty for the simple reason [that] he did not kill Lana Clarkson," Weinberg said.
Fidler had ruled jurors also could consider the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter.
Spector's first murder trial in 2007 ended in a mistrial as jurors said they couldn't reach a verdict after 15 days of deliberations.
Weinberg argued that the prosecution's case hinged on circumstantial evidence.
A female juror who declined to be identified told reporters the jurors considered all the evidence and testimony to reach their verdict.
In the 2007 trial, Spector's attorneys argued that Clarkson was depressed over a recent breakup and grabbed a .38-caliber pistol to kill herself while at Spector's home.
Five women took the stand and testified that he had threatened them with firearms.
That was one of two Grammy Awards won by Spector, who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989.
He stayed out of the public eye for two decades before his 2003 arrest in Clarkson's death.
