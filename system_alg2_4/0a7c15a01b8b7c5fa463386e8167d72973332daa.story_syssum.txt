Doctors performed the autopsy at a Misrata hospital in the presence of officials from the prosecutor's office, Zentani said.
The autopsy report will go to the attorney general's office before it is released to the public, he said.
Leaders of Libya's interim government have said Gadhafi was killed in crossfire after fighters captured him Thursday.
Peter Bouckaert, Human Rights Watch's emergencies director, told CNN that fighting had ended when Gadhafi was cornered in a drainage ditch.
An amateur video distributed by the Reuters news agency Sunday showed NTC fighters congratulating a man the fighters say killed Gadhafi.
"The contradictory statements issued by the NTC excusing these barbaric executions and the grotesque abuse of the corpses make it clear that no person affiliated with the former regime will receive a fair trial in Libya nor will they receive justice for crimes committed against them," the statement said.
The United Nations human rights office and activist groups like Amnesty and Human Rights Watch have called for a probe into Gadhafi's death.
They need to hold each other accountable.
"We believe there is a need for an investigation and more details are needed to ascertain whether he was killed in the fighting or after his capture.
