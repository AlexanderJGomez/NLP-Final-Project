The bodies of William Parente, 59; his wife, Betty, 58; and their daughters Stephanie, 19, and Catherine, 11, were found Monday in a room at the Sheraton Hotel in Towson, Maryland, a Baltimore suburb.
"Baltimore County Police has learned of allegations that William Parente may be involved in questionable financial dealings," Johnson said.
They were due to check out Monday, Johnson said, but failed to do so.
The bodies of Betty Parente and the two daughters were found on a king-size bed in the hotel room, while William Parente's body was found in the bathroom, police said.
Michael Hill said the older daughter might have been killed after she returned to the room and found her mother and sister dead.
There was no evidence they were restrained, Johnson said.
Loyola College spokeswoman Courtney Jolley said Stephanie Parente was a sophomore majoring in speech-language pathology with a natural-sciences minor.
She also volunteered through the college's Center for Community Service and Justice.
