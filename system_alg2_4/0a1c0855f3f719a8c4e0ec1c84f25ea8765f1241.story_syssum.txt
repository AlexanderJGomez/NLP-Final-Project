Given the nature of wireless networks and the current business landscape, T-Mobile probably needs to make some kind of major move if it hopes to survive in some form.
In the big picture, it takes a lot of capital to build out high-speed wireless broadband networks that can support an ever-growing number of data-hungry devices such as smartphones and tablets -- especially if streaming mobile video becomes popular, and if the Obama administration is serious about its national wireless initiative to make wireless broadband available to 98% of the U.S. population.
A less competitive wireless market could mean wireless broadband won't get much cheaper.
And it could even get more costly, especially if tiered data plans become the norm -- which would make more sense for the carriers in a less competitive environment.
Wireless Week noted: "T-Mobile currently markets its HSPA+ network as 4G but lacks the bandwidth to deploy LTE or WiMAX.
So if the Sprint merger doesn't happen, T-Mobile does have options -- mainly leasing additional spectrum or access to other providers' networks, such as LightSquared, a wholesale-only wireless LTE network.
