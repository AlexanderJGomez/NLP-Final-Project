Some members of Congress complained that Colbert's testimony before the House Immigration Subcommittee was undignified; others took issue with his invocation of Christian values.
But migrant workers suffer, and have no rights."
Christians take Jesus' words as a call to show justice and mercy to those at the very bottom of the social hierarchy.
Why?
For decades, farmers have relied on migrant workers, primarily immigrants, to do this difficult but essential work.
Undocumented farmworkers are poorly paid, enjoy few rights and live in fear of deportation.
(Undocumented immigrants, of course, pay sales taxes, and many pay Social Security and income taxes, though they are ineligible for most public benefits.)
They include securing our borders, fixing our broken legal immigration system and providing an equitable pathway to earned legal status for the currently undocumented.
And yet, after 21 months on the job, the 111th Congress has failed even to seriously debate the issues.
Politicians may resent Colbert's jokes, but they can scarcely blame the comedian if their constituents are exasperated by congressional inaction on this and other critical issues, despite the many promises on the campaign trail.
