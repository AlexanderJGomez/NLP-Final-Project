(CNN)In his State of the Union address, President Obama proposed making community college tuition free for two years to boost college graduation rates and lift more people into the middle class.
Even for those who earn a community college degree, it often isn't as useful as other options.
The conversation around making community college free also masks a larger problem, which is that community colleges are already heavily subsidized and far less affordable than commonly believed.
That means that more than 60% of the cost of community college isn't paid for through tuition, but through various forms of government aid at the federal, state and local levels.
The larger question the proposal misses is not how to allow students to afford college, but how to make college affordable.
Patten University offers a new online, competency-based program that charges undergraduate tuition of $350 per month, or $1,316 per term.
Rather than supporting innovative options like Patten and Southern New Hampshire, the President's plan would nudge students toward a community college sector that is incapable of repositioning its model around student success and fuel rising college costs.
By supporting free community college, President Obama is merely kicking the can down the road for future generations to confront.
