(CNN) -- When Peggielene Bartels went to bed on a summer night in 2008, she was an ordinary administrative assistant living in a modest one-bedroom condo just outside Washington D.C.
"I thought he was trying to really play games with me."
Over the course of a few days, she went from being plain old Peggielene Bartels, who had worked for nearly three decades at the Ghanaian Embassy in the United States, to becoming King Peggy -- the first female king of Otuam, reigning over approximately 7,000 people.
"I would have really regretted it if I hadn't really accept this calling."
King is the traditional title of Otuam's ruler, and Bartels says she's happy to be called a king, rather than queen, because it means she can achieve more.
In Washington, her secretarial duties include typing letters, answering phone calls and booking appointments.
But back in Ghana, she stands out as a gold crown-wearing, scepter-holding king who lives in a refurbished palace.
"When I am back home they see me as their king and they want to pamper me," she says.
But beyond the bows, the royal attire and certain luxuries that come with her title, being a king in an impoverished place like Otuam is all about dealing with the pressing needs of the community and improving the lives of the people, says Bartels.
In the last few years, she's helped poor families pay school fees for their children and brought computers to classrooms.
"If there is something that I want to know, they tell me.
"Queen Latifah is going to play me and I'm so happy to at least let the whole world know that a secretary can become a king and lead wisely and help the people."
