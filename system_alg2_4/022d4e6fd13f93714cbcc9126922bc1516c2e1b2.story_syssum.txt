(CNN) -- "You've got to save your best leadership for home."
I'm on my way home," she said after school was dismissed early, and parents were rushing to get their children.
As a journalist, I recognized that a news story was breaking before me.
Midnight approached and my wife told me she hadn't been able to move the car at all since 10 p.m.
I felt hopeless and helpless.
I called Georgia State Patrol and explained to them that my wife and kids were stranded in a vehicle among hundreds of other vehicles.
I called local authorities and was told the same thing.
On Facebook, I posted: "More than 14 and a half hours, my wife and kids remain stranded in car stuck in traffic because of snow.
My wife later told me she cried only once, around 5 a.m., not knowing when she was going to be able to get the children home.
It was so, so cold and she couldn't keep the engine running all night for fear of running out of gas.
I felt so guilty about it all.
I called the Georgia State Patrol and local authorities one more time.
I told them if police couldn't get my family , it was time for me to try.
She said she didn't think I could get to her.
The reaction came pouring in.
I trudged up an ice-covered northbound lane of highway, as Ken's pickup made a zig-zag between hundreds of stranded vehicles to get to a safe stop.
I was leading my family home.
