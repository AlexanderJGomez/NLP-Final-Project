The visitors had hoped to cement their strong position in this season's title battle with the return of Cristiano Ronaldo, who had been suspended for two matches following a sending off last month.
But Atletico pushed on in the second half with goals from Antoine Griezmann and Mario Mandzukic sealing a historic derby day victory.
His return from suspension did little to revive what was a limp and lifeless Real performance.
"Real Madrid cannot lose 4-0 against anyone," said Ronaldo.
Atletico coach Diego Simeone, meanwhile, was ecstatic at his team's performance.
