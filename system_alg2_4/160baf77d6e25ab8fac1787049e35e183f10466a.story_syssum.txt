The controversial issue of team orders in Formula 1 has once again tested respect between teammates -- and ahead of Sunday's race Vettel said he would probably do it again given he felt Webber had not supported him in the past -- and raised question marks over the purity of the sport's racing.
"All the team wants to see is if one driver has a problem he will not make it difficult for his teammate.
"I don't think there's the same respect now for other drivers," British racing legend Stirling Moss told CNN.
During his F1 career between 1951-60, Moss would only sign contracts that named him as the team's number one driver.
"When a team had the lead, the number one driver would hold position and not pass him, says Moss.
"Because (Red Bull) had specifically said to (Vettel) let Webber have it, that made him a naughty boy but he felt, 'well dammit, why shouldn't I win?'
On the other side of the garage, the Malaysia team orders drama may have more emotional, career-defining consequences for Webber, whose Red Bull contract expires at the end of the season.
But there wasn't, says Barrichello.
"And then it was exactly the case the following year in 2002.
That career-defining moment for Barrichello also led to a decision by the sport's governing body, the FIA, to ban team orders that directly affected the outcome of a race.
Team orders have always existed in F1 because, in simple terms, teams also want to be happy -- and that often means making money.
"The team has always been the most important thing," said Moss.
"But once you're with a company you really have to do what they tell you to.
"I don't think drivers accept that," says Barrichello.
"I suppose he was a naughty boy," Moss says, "but he is a racing driver who's paid to go fast.
Vettel, Webber and Red Bull will begin to find out how much crossing that line in Malaysia has hurt them when they reunite in Shanghai.
