(CNN) -- German medical groups joined the French health ministry Friday in recommending that women seek removal of breast implants made by a French company, saying they need not hurry but the devices could pose eventual health problems.
Since then, more than 1,000 implants have ruptured, the agency said.
Nicholson said the government would pay to have the implants removed from women who received them as part of reconstructive care provided by the publicly funded National Health Service.
An estimated 300,000 women in 65 countries received breast implants from the company.
