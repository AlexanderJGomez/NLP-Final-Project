Johannesburg (CNN) -- South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu turned 80 on Friday, days after a spat with the government over a visa delay that forced the Dalai Lama to cancel a trip to the nation.
"Please take care," the Dalai Lama said.
Now I have doubt whether I will have the occasion to meet Nelson Mandela or not."
"When we used to apply for passports under the apartheid government, we never knew until the last moment what their decision was," Tutu said at a news conference.
"We congratulate Archbishop Desmond Tutu ... and join South Africa and the global community in honoring a man who is recognized for his fearlessness in speaking truth to power," the embassy in Pretoria said in a statement.
This is not the first time the Dalai Lama has not been able to visit South Africa.
