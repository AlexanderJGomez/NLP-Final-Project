(CNN) -- Politics might well be a dirty game, but in Malaysia where allegations of vote-buying, sex scandals and violence are a feature of the political landscape, a group of disaffected activists have distilled these predictable shabby tricks into a popular card game.
Cook up a sex scandal to alienate your enemy's supporters - or to betray your own allies!"
But are they really your friends?
In an ironic twist, the game has even become popular with some politicians in Malaysia's ruling UMNO coalition, according to the group that developed the card game.
Malaysian media reports say about 2.6 million of the country's 13.3 million eligible voters will cast their ballots for the first time in a bitterly fought poll that could see the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition - which has been in power for 56 years - lose to opposition parties for the first time.
"We don't have a reliable mainstream media in Malaysia," said Chi Too, a communications officer with MCCHR.
A lot of people are now relying on social media and alternative media that can be found with online newspapers and the like."
PR is headed by Anwar Ibrahim, a former finance and deputy prime minister who served time in prison on corruption and sodomy charges which he says were politically motivated.
In a hard-fought campaign, both parties have been trying to entice voters with promises of generous government spending.
