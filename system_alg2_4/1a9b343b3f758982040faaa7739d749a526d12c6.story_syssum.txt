Thanks to Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman, eagle-eyed visitors to London might just spot the three humps of an enormous hippo appearing from the Thames' murky depths.
"I was thinking about the history, but I also had to think about practicalities," Hofman says.
So the installation is something which is partly inspired by a found object," he says.
"'These pieces were inspired by children's toys or items picked up from flea markets I've visited -- mass-produced toys and animal ceramics," he says.
I have a love for these objects and the way they get circulated around the world."
"The bunny was removed after three months but afterward, more people started to visit the spot.
"I love the people.
In Asia and South America people will ask, 'what is it and why is it there?'"
"In Europe, people work hard but they have more spare time and there's a different pace.
Florentjin's own spare time on the sidelines of the London festival is likely to spent in one of the city's pubs, he says.
Hofman says "HippopoThames" will be his final water-based project.
