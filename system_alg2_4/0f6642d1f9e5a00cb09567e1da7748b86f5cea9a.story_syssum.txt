NEW YORK (CNN) -- After a nearly year-long investigation, police say they now believe 10 sets of human remains uncovered along a desolate stretch of Long Island, New York, beach are linked to a single killer.
It is not clear what prompted the change.
At least 10 sets of human remains have been found in Nassau and Suffolk counties since December.
But the woman whose disappearance triggered the searches, 23-year-old Shannan Gilbert, remains missing.
Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota said in May that the newly found remains were not believed to be connected to the first four victims.
"This investigation is not an episode of 'CSI' or 'Criminal Minds' that is going to be solved in a one-hour period," Spota said of the serial killer probe.
