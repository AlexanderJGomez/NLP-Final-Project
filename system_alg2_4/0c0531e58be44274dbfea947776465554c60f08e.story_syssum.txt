The American Medical Association Alliance, pointing to research that big-screen smoking leads teens to pick up the tobacco habit, called for an R rating for any movie with smoking scenes.
The Motion Picture Association of America, the industry group that issues ratings and parental guidance for U.S. films, added smoking scenes as a factor in ratings two years ago, but Fielding said it has not made a difference.
The association has given no G ratings in the past two years to a movie with smoking, Graves said.
A G movie is deemed suitable for all audiences, while a PG rating is a signal to parents that a film may include some material they might consider inappropriate for children.
A spokesman for Twentieth Century Fox, the studio responsible for the Wolverine movie series, said Jackman's cigar was never lit and it was limited to just two scenes.
The alliance will keep an online scorecard throughout the summer to count "how many tobacco impressions each studio delivers to G, PG and PG-13 audiences," she said.
They began factoring smoking scenes into the ratings two years ago as "a reflection of changes in society and health concerns," she said.
"Any movie with smoking should be rated R," he said.
Graves, whose committee makes the decisions, indicated such a zero-tolerance policy would not be accepted.
