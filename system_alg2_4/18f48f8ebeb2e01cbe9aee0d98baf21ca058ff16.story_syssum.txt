(CNN) -- It was like a scene from a big-budget Hollywood disaster movie -- a Godzilla of a fire roaring down the mountain, straight toward Brandon Hanson's Colorado Springs neighborhood.
He'd just moved to Colorado Springs in April with his wife, Maria.
Paperwork, passports, pictures.
The Hansons scoured through photos posted on online news sites trying see their house.
The fire has forced about 36,000 people to evacuate their homes.
One of them, Mindy Levinson, was forced to leave her apartment Tuesday, accompanied by her young son.
Levinson said she doesn't believe her apartment has been affected.
I want to make sure I take that down," he told CNN affiliate KCNC.
"That's just one more thing I am having to deal with in the middle of all this," he said.
The family fled the Peregrine neighborhood in northwest Colorado Springs on a two-lane road that quickly turned into a parking lot.
But none like this.
"That is Colorado Springs, the city I was born and raised in, the city that is at war with nature," Sobecki said.
Mark Galley wondered whether he would see his house again in the Mount Shadows neighborhood.
But she couldn't take everything.
"I keep telling myself it's going to be OK," she said.
"With much sadness we have to report that the Flying W Ranch as well as several homes in the Mountain Shadows area has in fact been burned to the ground," the website said.
It will be another good, clean family show, Wolfe said.
Everything looked like it was on fire, smoke everywhere."
People were still trying to go on with life, as though that were possible.
"It was stunning to look at," he said.
The flames were among the people, in their city.
