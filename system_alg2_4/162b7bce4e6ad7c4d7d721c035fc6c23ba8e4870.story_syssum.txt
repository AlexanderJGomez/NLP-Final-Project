(CNN) -- The so-called richest game in football hinged on a late defensive error by Derby captain Richard Keogh as Bobby Zamora scored a dramatic injury-time winner for 10-man Queens Park Rangers in the Championship playoff at Wembley Saturday.
"We were hanging on for our lives," he admitted.
Victory over Wigan saw QPR into the final, while Derby thrashed Brighton to reach the Wembley showdown.
For McClaren it was a bitter disappointment after guiding his young team to third place in the regular season standings and a deserved place in the final.
"For somebody to make mistakes -- we don't blame anybody," he added.
