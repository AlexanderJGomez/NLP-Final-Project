The mood at the show was somber, said Bob Templeton of Crossroads of the West Gun Shows.
"We had a moment of silence here at the show," Templeton said, referring to the deaths of six people and the wounding of 13 others, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, after last Saturday's shooting.
"It's going to be a long dialogue on gun control and gun rights, and it will be hard to strike a balance between those two positions," he said.
Bill Schaeffler of Tucson, among those at the show Saturday, said he knows gun control and high-capacity ammunition magazines will be hot topics.
"You just have to admire somebody ... who has that kind of perseverance," said Charles Heller, secretary of the Arizona Citizens Defense League.
Templeton told CNN affiliate KGUN the massacre had nothing to do with lawful gun ownership.
