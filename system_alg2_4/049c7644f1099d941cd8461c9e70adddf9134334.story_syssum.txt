Porto Santo Stefano, Italy (CNN) -- Rescuers reached two trapped honeymooners in the interior of a cruise ship more than 24 hours after it ran aground off a picturesque Italian island, killing three people, injuring 20 and leaving dozens unaccounted for.
"For me, the worst part of the whole ordeal" was when a lifeboat crew member told those boarding that it was "women and children first," said passenger Benji Smith of Boston.
"All these families who were clinging to each other had to be separated," Smith told CNN.
Concordia's captain, Francesco Schettino, was interviewed earlier Saturday about what happened when the ship struck rocks in shallow water off Italy's western coast Friday evening, said officer Emilio Del Santo of the Coastal Authorities of Livorno.
"Me and the crew, we were the last to abandon ship," he said.
"What we know is the ship went really close to these rocks.
Authorities also were looking at why the ship didn't hail a mayday during the accident.
"These people could be still on the island of Giglio, in private houses or in hospitals," Orsina said.
Two French tourists and a crew member from Peru were killed, Port authorities in Livorno said.
Gianni Onorato, president of Genoa-based Costa Cruises, expressed "deep sorrow for this terrible tragedy," but said the cruise line was unable to answer all the questions that authorities are now investigating.
Concordia was carrying about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members when it ran aground.
Panic spread as people scrambled to find lifeboats in the dark as the ship quickly leaned to one side late Friday.
Buddy Reams, chief of the U.S. Coast Guard's Cruise Ship National Center of Expertise, said, "when it comes to cruise ships, in the event of emergency, cabin stewards or others would have safety roles," he said.
The Coast Guard inspects foreign-flagged cruise ships in U.S. waters twice a year, studying the competency of the crew during fire and abandon-ship drills, Reams said.
Once ashore, no one from the crew assisted them, Shafer said.
Costa Cruises, owned by parent company Carnival Corp., said it was focusing on the final stages of the emergency operation and helping passengers and crew return home.
Most of the passengers on board were Italian.
There were no reports of injured Americans though the U.S. Embassy in Rome said it was unable to account for all U.S. citizens believed to be on board the ship at the time of the accident.
