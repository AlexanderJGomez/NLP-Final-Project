Khawaja, however, was arrested on June 3 after entering the United Kingdom at the port city of Dover, Metropolitan Police said.
He was a senior figure in Rayat al Tawheed, a group aligned to the Islamic State terrorist group that celebrated its terrorist acts through social media back to the UK," Walton said.
Bhatti pleaded guilty last month to assisting an offender and was sentenced Friday to 21 months in prison, Metropolitan Police said.
