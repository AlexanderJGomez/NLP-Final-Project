Thirteen people are confirmed dead and dozens remain missing after the TransAsia Airways ATR-72, carrying 58 people, veered out of control en route from Taipei to Kinmen, off the coast of the Chinese province of Xiamen.
The two people in the taxi were injured but in a stable condition after being taken to hospital, CNA said.
He said 31 of the passengers aboard the flight were Chinese tourists, including three children.
Some were also going to Xiamen to assist two Chinese travel agencies, Chen said.
Chou added that the agency had sent personnel to the crash site.
Last year, an older TransAsia ATR 72, which was attempting to land in the Taiwanese Penghu Islands crashed, resulting in 49 deaths.
