I'm pretty much there with my songs, and I'm really just sitting on the fence in regards to a producer.
I've been listening to that one a lot more and kind of stuck on the sound of that record.
Both of those productions really appeal to me, and the direction that they took -- just trying to get ideas for myself.
So it's just really determining where am I really at and just looking through that.
I still want to remain positive with my lyrics and stay in that mode with my music, because I enjoy uplifting myself, if you will, with my songs.
I've just got to get myself to that next stage.
It's overwhelming, and it's overwhelming trying to pinpoint who to go with on this project, because it will determine a lot of the direction, and I'm committing myself.
And I've had a lot of fun just being creative with it and just floating around, changing my mind.
And at some point that's got to end.
I probably could start doing that, but I don't want to get locked into a performance mode with a song, either, until I've taken it a little further down the line.
The show took well over a year to put together, so that was a production in itself, like making a record.
So I wrote the show with all of that in mind, knowing I would have all this technology available -- this great room, the acoustics and this giant stage and everything like that.
I want it to be familiar to people as well.
I want people to hear the songs they know.
Sting I've seen a few times and he really inspired me, in the sense that he breaks the songs down a lot and will take a different approach.
I played around with that a little bit in the show as well, so that was an influence.
So I did some of that.
