(CNN) -- A graduate student is suing a Georgia university, alleging that professors are requiring her to change her "biblical views" on homosexuality or be expelled from the counseling program there.
At first, Keeton agreed to the remediation plan, according to the suit.
No student is asked to change their religious beliefs or views in order to participate in any program."
"Talking to others -- espousing ideas about homosexuality or other beliefs is a behavior," Martz said.
French said the remediation program itself seeks to change Keeton's beliefs.
French said Keeton has repeatedly told the counseling department she would uphold the valid code of ethics of the American Counseling Association.
French said the counseling department has imposed its own set of values to "cleanse" Christianity from students' belief system, violating its own ethics code.
Keeton's suit asks for nominal and actual damages based on violation of her civil rights.
