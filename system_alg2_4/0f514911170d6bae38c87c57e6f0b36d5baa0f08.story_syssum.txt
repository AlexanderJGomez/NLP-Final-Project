Reyhanli, Turkey (CNN) -- Rage grew in a Turkish town on Syria's border Monday in the aftermath of weekend bombings as the government blamed Marxists with Syrian connections for the deadly attacks.
Another 100 or so have been injured, authorities have said.
"The members of the Security Council reaffirmed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security, and that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed," a written statement from the Security Council said.
Some resent the flood of refugees that Ankara's generosity toward Syrians fleeing the violence has brought on.
One Reyhanli resident, Abu Marwan, said Saturday that people began grabbing sticks and "going after Syrians" in the aftermath of the bombings.
"He added that the Turkish government has been facilitating the delivery of weapons, explosive devices, car bombs, money and killers into Syria," the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said of al-Zoubi.
The first blast occurred at about 1:55 p.m. Saturday at Reyhanli's city hall.
The Local Coordination Committees for Syria, an opposition group, has reported that Syrian government forces had fired several shells in the direction of Reyhanli, which is in Turkey's southern province of Hatay.
The town's location "carries sensitivity," Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Saturday, according to the semiofficial news agency Anadolu.
