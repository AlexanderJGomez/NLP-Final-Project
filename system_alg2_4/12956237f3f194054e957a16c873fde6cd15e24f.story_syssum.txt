Atlanta (CNN) -- A Georgia judge Friday dismissed an emergency motion filed by the ex-wife of music mogul Usher Raymond seeking temporary custody of their son.
And Ms. Oden did impress me as a capable caregiver," Fulton County Superior Court Judge John Goger said, referring to the boy's aunt, Rena Oden, who was caring for the child at the time of the accident.
Foster Raymond also said Usher does not keep her informed about who is taking of their children or the doings in the children's lives.
"I don't know if my son is going to have a brain defect.
Foster Raymond said Usher's aunt is incapable of keeping up with the two children.
She kept repeating "that's chaos" as she wiped her eyes, and the judge told her to get off the stand.
The judge told the attorney to move on with her questions.
Five-year-old Usher Raymond V is recovering from Monday's accident at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Hospital, according to the lawyer for Foster Raymond.
That case hadn't been heard by the time the swimming pool accident happened Monday, so Foster Raymond filed Tuesday for an emergency hearing on the matter.
Usher's former stepson, also Foster Raymond's son, died in a watercraft accident on a north Georgia lake last year.
