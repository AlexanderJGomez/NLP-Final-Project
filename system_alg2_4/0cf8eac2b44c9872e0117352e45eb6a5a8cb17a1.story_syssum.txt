Now that Republicans have control of both houses of Congress, they are going to have to do better -- and do right by all Americans, not just their fringe conservative base.
Maybe for conservative Republicans but certainly not for most Americans, especially when unemployment was 9% and the economy was still reeling from the Great Recession.
Then, as now, Americans say the economy is the most important problem facing the country.
Meanwhile, Republicans have touted a list of "more than 30 jobs bills" they have passed in the House but have failed in the Democratic Senate.
The American people have entrusted Republicans with control of Congress.
For six years, Republicans have condemned President Barack Obama and the Democratic agenda.
Going into this election, while only 23% of Americans have a "very positive" view of Obama and just 12% view the Democratic Party very positively, the favorability percentage for the Republican Party is even lower -- just 7%, according to one survey.
That would be stupid.
Maybe there are even reasonable compromises to be found in reforming the tax code, making it simpler and more transparent while at the same time fairer.
Now that they have full power in Congress either to compromise or not with the White House, Republicans have no more excuses.
The O'Jays were singing about the real world -- real people and problems that political leaders should be addressing.
Here's hoping Republicans are up to the task to which they've been elected.
