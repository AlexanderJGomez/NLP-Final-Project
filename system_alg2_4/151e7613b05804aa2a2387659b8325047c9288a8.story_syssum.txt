(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo underlined just why Real Madrid agreed to pay him the big bucks on a scintillating evening of European football.
The away victory saw the nine time European champions kick off a new era of European football under manager Carlo Ancelotti in some style.
David Moyes also came through his first game as Manchester United manager unscathed as the club made its first European outing without Sir Alex Ferguson at the helm since 1985.
Moyes watched Rooney -- the star striker he sold to United from Everton in 2004 -- pounce again with his 200th goal for Manchester United.
With two minutes on the clock, Omer Toprak pulled back another away goal for Leverkusen but United came off the pitch 4-2 winners in the Group A clash.
Edin Dzeko broke the deadlock after half time when he slotted home a pass from Sergio Aguero, who used his muscle to hold off the Czech defence.
