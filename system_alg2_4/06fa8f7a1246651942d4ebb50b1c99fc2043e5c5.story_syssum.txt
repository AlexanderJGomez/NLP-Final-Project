The Clintons left the White House more than a dozen years ago "dead broke" and in debt, according to Hillary Clinton, who defended the hefty speaking fees she commands since stepping down as secretary of state last year.
The Clintons departed the White House in debt due to enormous legal fees.
Bill Clinton made more than $9.2 million in speaking fees in 2001 and more than $9.5 million in 2002.
A CNN analysis of the family's financial records in early 2013 showed that Bill Clinton had earned $106 million from paid speeches since leaving the presidency behind.
Clinton has become a staple on the paid speaking circuit.
On its website, America Rising said the two homes the Clintons purchased after leaving the White House in Chappaqua, New York, and Washington cost around $4.5 million combined.
"Well, I certainly would give anything on earth if this had not happened," Clinton said.
But I also am clear in my own mind that we had a system and that system, of course, ended with me."
