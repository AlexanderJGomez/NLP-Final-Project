(CNN) -- Celebrity chef Kathy Casey predicts two flavor trends in cocktails for 2010 will be fresh ginger and hibiscus.
The "flaming agent" is green Chartreuse.
Drizzle or "spritz" the thyme with the green Chartreuse.
Then quickly add the simple syrup to extinguish the flames.
Fill the glass with ice and stir well.
Immediately remove from heat.
This one incorporates two of my flavor trends for cocktails in 2010 -- fresh ginger and hibiscus.
Place the ginger in the bottom of a cocktail shaker.
Measure in the gin, lemon juice and Hibiscus Syrup.
Strain into a large martini glass and garnish with candied ginger on a pick.
Then remove from the heat and let steep for 30 minutes.
Let the syrup cool and then place in a clean bottle or pitcher, cover and refrigerated up to two weeks.
