I wonder if Hillary Clinton would be at home baking cookies instead of serving as secretary of state if women's suffrage was put to a vote back in 1919.
It's not.
I can't think of a single major civil rights victory that came by way of a general election and so I am not surprised that all 32 states that have voted on marriage equality, voted against marriage equality.
"If it's not broke, don't fix it," was never said by the community that was demanding their rights.
This is why our history has so many civil rights victories come by way of Congress or the courts and so few if any civil rights victories by election.
Washington joins Maryland, Maine and Minnesota as the next round of states that will put the civil rights of some of their citizens to a vote.
