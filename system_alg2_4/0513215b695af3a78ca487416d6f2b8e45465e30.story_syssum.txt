If that isn't a wave out there on the horizon, it is, at the moment anyway, a big, Republican-leaning ripple.
Odds of a GOP takeover of the Senate are looking up eight weeks to Election Day.
So, even if the GOP has a great Election Night, it is unrealistic to believe there could be a 30-seat gain in the House, as the Democrats enjoyed in 2006.
"I don't see any evidence of a wave like we had in '06 or '08," says Ayres.
In the CNN poll numbers, the encouraging news for the President is that he and the public are largely in sync about how muscular to be in responding to ISIS.
Even so, his job approval rating is stagnant at 43%, and the percentage of Americans who think things are going badly in the country stands at 55%, up from 50% in April.
But for now, the numbers are compelling: A weak President and a worried electorate are the trademark ingredients of a wave.
