That decision prompted a response from the family of Eric Harris, the man Bates killed.
We are, however, surprised that Mr. Bates would choose to go on a vacation to the Bahamas during this tumultuous time.
Bates, 73, was working as a reserve deputy for the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office on April 2 when he was involved the arrest of Eric Harris in a weapons sting operation.
He has apologized to the Harris family, as has Sheriff Stanley Glanz.
