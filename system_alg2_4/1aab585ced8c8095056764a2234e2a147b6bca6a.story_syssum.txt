(CNN) -- Portugal football legend Eusebio, who was top scorer at the 1966 World Cup, died at the age of 71, his former club Benfica said Sunday.
Portugal's former world player of the year, Luis Figo, tweeted that Eusebio was the "king" while Brazil's Pele, considered by many to be the best footballer of all time, tweeted that Eusebio was like a "brother" to him.
Named European Footballer of the Year in 1965, Eusebio won widespread acclaim the following year at the World Cup in England.
Added UEFA president Michel Platini: "On the field, Eusebio was a true legend, both in the colors of Portugal and Benfica," he told UEFA's website.
During his career with Benfica, the Lisbon side won the European Cup in 1962.
"We're saddened to hear Benfica legend Eusebio has passed away," tweeted Manchester United.
