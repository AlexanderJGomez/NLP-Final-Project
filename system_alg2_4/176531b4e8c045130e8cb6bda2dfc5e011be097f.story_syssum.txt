The striker has been tempted away from Italian giants AC Milan to ply his trade in the French league, signing on a three-year contract for a reputed fee of $24.5 million.
"I want to thank Paris Saint-Germain and (sporting director) Leonardo for the great work they've done," Ibrahimovic told a press conference at the club's Parc des Princes stadium.
In my mind I was very clear, and I knew what I wanted.
He won two Dutch titles during a three year stay at Ajax Amsterdam before moving to Juventus in Italy.
He then moved to Internazionale where he helped the Nerazzurri claim three league titles before he moved to Barcelona, winning five trophies in his two seasons at the Spanish club.
I was very happy to be at Milan.
They made it easy for me to come to PSG so I thank them and I wish them all the best."
PSG also announced the signing of 19-year-old midfielder Marco Verratti from Serie A club Pescara and the club's sporting director Leonardo said that their transfer business had now been completed.
