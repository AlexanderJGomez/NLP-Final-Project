Jerusalem (CNN) -- When Tanya Rosenblit boarded an inter-city bus bound for Jerusalem from her native Ashdod Friday morning, she did not anticipate the storm it would spark within Israel.
"He demanded I sit in the back of the bus, because Jewish men couldn't sit behind women (!!!).
"There were like 20 of them, all wearing black.
Rosenblit said he asked if she was willing to show respect for the objectors and move to the back of the bus.
She refused and, after a 30-minute delay, the bus moved on to Jerusalem with her sitting up front.
Today, for example, I have heard of an attempt to move a woman from her seat on a bus.
Netanyahu said.
"There are a lot of lovely things about religion, but forcing people to choose religion is wrong," she said.
