The Grammy Award winner started the Common Ground Foundation to help underserved youth develop leadership and life skills.
Common: I started (the foundation) with some of my team members because we wanted to give back to the youth who didn't have some of the opportunities we had.
Common: I grew up on the South Side of Chicago with my mother and my stepfather, and I was provided a nice home, a home with love in it.
My whole life growing up, I was doing the little things that I could do (to help people).
I want to empower them first by letting them know that they are loved and people do care.
But they have other people that do care.
We want to prepare them to be able to go out into the world and do things for themselves so they can be leaders.
And it was super-inspiring to me.
I was like, "I want to go back, I need to get invited back."
Common: A hero to me is someone who is able to take whatever talent, gift, personality, quality and utilize it to help build others.
