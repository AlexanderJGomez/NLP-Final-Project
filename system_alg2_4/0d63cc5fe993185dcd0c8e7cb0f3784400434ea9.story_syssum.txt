Police also announced the arrest of the man they say killed Anjelica and dumped her body along the Henry Hudson Parkway.
Detectives from the New York Police Department's Cold Case Apprehension Squad never stopped searching for answers in the case.
It led detectives to Anjelica's sister, now an adult; from there, they identified the woman believed to be the girl's mother, he said.
Police arrested Juarez after questioning him near the Manhattan restaurant where he worked as a dishwasher, Kelly said.
Juarez admitted to the crime Saturday morning, Kelly said.
Juarez told police he smothered her with a pillow while raping her.
It was the sister who told Juarez to get rid of the body and who provided the cooler, Kelly said.
The sister, Balvena Juarez Ramirez, is deceased, Kelly said.
Well, that's where I am right now," Giorgio told reporters.
From there, investigators constructed a family tree, and the trail led them to Juarez, Kelly said.
"They were unrelenting," he said.
