Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's father filed a wrongful death lawsuit in federal court against Dr. Conrad Murray on Friday, the anniversary of the pop star's death, Joe Jackson's lawyer said.
The suit contends that Murray used the time to hide evidence of drugs he had been giving Jackson.
Murray, who had taken over control of resuscitation efforts from paramedics, said nothing to emergency room doctors about the propofol or "other drugs" he had given Michael Jackson earlier in the day, it said.
"He had a history of addiction, and the defendant was trying to wean him off the drugs, yet he told Dr. Cooper two days earlier that Michael Jackson had no drug use history," the suit said.
"There is no way that Dr. Murray pumped Michael Jackson full of propofol sufficient for major surgery," attorney Ed Chernoff said.
He was cold and shivering during the summer rehearsals for his show, and as shown in photographs and motion pictures of him, he uncharacteristically wore heavy clothing during the rehearsals, while other dancers wore scant clothing and were perspiring from the heat."
