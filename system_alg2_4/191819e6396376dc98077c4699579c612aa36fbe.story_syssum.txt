Two people, holding flashlights, face each other and make a steady beam of light for others to limbo under.
Print out words to the Limbo Rock to make your own music; as kids are eliminated they can tap on the floor to the beat.
Make one kid the "museum guide" and give them a flashlight.
If the museum guide can make the "art" laugh or move, the "art" becomes the new museum guide.
