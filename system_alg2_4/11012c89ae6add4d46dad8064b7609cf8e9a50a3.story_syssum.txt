Larry, left, at age 10 with his younger brother, Marty, shortly after their father died.
I was walking home from the library carrying nine books.
There were a lot of books under my arm on that summer day because I loved books.
I don't remember exactly when I started to hear my mother's screams.
For years, before the war started and my father went to work in the defense plant, he'd owned a little neighborhood bar and grill.
The cops loved my father the way they loved any bar owner who had a great sense of humor.
The cop put me in the squad car.
I remember that.
I'll never forget the movie, Bataan, starring Robert Taylor as Sergeant Bill Dane.
They're cut down one by one until only Sergeant Dane and two others remain.
I don't remember what it was like when I got home that day.
I'd been so close to my father -- yet I refused to go.
I remember bouncing a spaldeen -- the Spalding rubber ball we used to play stickball -- off the front stoop.
I never went back to that library again, and from that day on I was nervous if I saw a squad car in my neighborhood.
