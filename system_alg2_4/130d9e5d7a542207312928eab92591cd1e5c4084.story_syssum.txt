(CNN) -- A 4.2-magnitude earthquake struck near Guthrie, Oklahoma, at 7:41 a.m. CT (8:41 a.m.
It's highly unlikely there was damage from the quake, said Austin Holland, a research seismologist with the Oklahoma Geological Survey.
But the temblor stands out from others that have happened in the state because many people appear to have felt it, Holland said.
Just last Sunday, nine earthquakes were recorded, including two that were 3.8 magnitude.
In Tulsa, the quakes are felt, but barely, like a low rumble.
