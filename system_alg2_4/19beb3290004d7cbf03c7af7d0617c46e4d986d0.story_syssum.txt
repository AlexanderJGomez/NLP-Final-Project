(CNN) -- The chairman of Tennessee's Democratic Party wants a Republican legislative aide fired for sending out a "reprehensible" e-mail depicting President Obama as two cartoonish white eyes peering from a black background.
She said, without elaborating, that she mistakenly sent it "to the wrong list of people."
"I want to be sure that everyone understands that the communication was sent without my knowledge," Black said Tuesday afternoon.
"This is an employee who has had a stellar record," Black said.
"We followed policy.
"I am calling on Sen. Black to reject this racist smear and fire this staffer who, on state government time, on state government computers, using a state government e-mail account, launched this bigoted attack on our president," Forrester said.
Grantham said Goforth told him she felt "very bad about accidentally sending it to the wrong list" of people.
Forrester, in his Web posting, said, "Ms. Goforth does not seem to understand what she did wrong.
I don't think she should be a part of the people who represent the state of Tennessee," Shaw said.
He said Goforth and Black, as well as Republican Lt. Gov.
It's disgusting.
"The last thing we need in the state of Tennessee is to send out the impression and the image that we are still stuck in some backwater mentality and culture that feels it's OK to depict the president of the United States in that fashion," state Rep. John Deberry Jr., D-Memphis, told CNN Radio.
