The FAA said Pirker's flight ran afoul of its strict rules governing the commercial use of drones.
"The agency is concerned that this decision could impact ... the safety of people and property on the ground," the FAA said in a statement.
In a press release headlined "Busting Myths about the FAA and Unmanned Aircraft," it stressed that UAS enthusiasts could not use drones for commercial purposes.
"There are no shades of gray in FAA regulations," the FAA continued.
The FAA is appealing the matter to the full safety board.
