So the aerodynamics of Congress as it gets close to an election are this: Stop.
Except for this: Republicans have recently made a fetish of complaining that President Barack Obama won't let them vote on things.
Too many executive actions.
House Speaker John Boehner intoned mightily on the House floor.
Are these the same people who now are, um, ducking a vote on congressional authorization for action against ISIS?
Instead there will be a vote to authorize the arming of the Syrian rebels.
We all know that in the world in which we live, Congress -- with an approval rating of 14% -- wants to take responsibility for things that are good and avoid responsibility for things that are risky.
(George W. Bush went to Congress to approve the Iraq war, but only after much debate and pressure -- and even his vice president opposed the idea.)
The President can issue strong policy regulations and orders when it comes to health care and the environment, but he shouldn't act without Congress when it comes to war.
"Right now we believe, as the President has stated, that he has the authority he needs," says House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.
Not quite.
That's when politicians vote.
