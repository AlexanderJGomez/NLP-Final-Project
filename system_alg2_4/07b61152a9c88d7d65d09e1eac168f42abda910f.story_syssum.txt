Ivan Lopez vented about a range of subjects on Facebook before his shooting rampage at Fort Hood in Texas, including his outrage at Adam Lanza's mass school shooting in Connecticut.
A family spokesman confirmed the account belonged to Lopez.
Authorities have said the motive is not known.
Full of hate.
In another Facebook post, Lopez talked about Lanza, 20, who killed his mother, Nancy, before fatally shooting 20 children, six staff members and himself at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown in December 2012.
He added, "It is stupid to me that anyone can have easy access to a powerful weapon without being mentally evaluated.
It has been exactly 1 year and 2 days since left Iraq seeing in Fallujah the most brutal explosion...
Lt. Gen. Mark Milley, the post's commanding general, said Lopez did not experience direct combat in Iraq.
Messages left Saturday by CNN for Grey about the Facebook posts were not immediately returned.
Before Wednesday's shooting, Lopez stopped at the post's personnel office to pick up a leave form, according to the sister of one of the soldiers injured in the attack.
The soldier was told he would have to come back later, Otis said.
Glidden Lopez Torres, a family spokesman, said Lopez' mother, Carmen, an emergency room nurse in their hometown, died of a heart attack in November.
The spokesman, not related to the soldier, said Lopez attended the funeral but was disappointed that it took about five days for his 24-hour leave to be approved by the military.
