Of the 1.4 million dogs euthanized at shelters last year, roughly half were pit bull types, Merritt Clifton says.
Officials and animal rights advocates agree that the dogs must lose this last battle for their lives because of their brutal training and risks to people and other animals.
Of the 1.4 million dogs euthanized at shelters last year, roughly half were pit bull types, according to the latest data from Merritt Clifton, editor of Animal People.
Owners sometimes kill the dogs that don't win.
If the dogs do make it to shelters, they are usually euthanized quickly.
"Even if you can do it to some degree, all it takes is one lapse in the animal's behaviors to kill another animal or exhibit some other type of aggression."
The stigma associated with pit bull types has victimized the "good" pit bulls, Pacelle said.
More than 90 percent of pit bulls in shelters -- fighters or not -- end up euthanized, said Clifton, who has been researching animal shelters for more than three decades.
"It was back in the '70s, '80s and '90s when people discovered just how loving these animals are -- so loving that they would fight to the death to please their owners," Boks said.
Considering the risk the fighting dogs pose to shelters, potential owners and other animals, "they just don't have a chance," Clifton said.
