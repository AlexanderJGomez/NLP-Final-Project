Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Ten Americans detained last week while trying to take 33 Haitian children out of the country were charged Thursday with kidnapping children and criminal association, a government official said.
Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive told CNN's "Larry King Live" on Thursday night that the judge in the case has three months to decide whether to prosecute.
Told that the families of the detained Americans had pleaded for him to intervene, Bellerive said he could not.
"Until now, I was not asked," he said.
"We can confirm that the 10 American citizens remain in custody in Haiti," said State Department deputy spokesman Gordon Duguid.
The Americans have said they were just trying to help the children leave the earthquake-stricken country.

"Clearly, there are questions about procedure as to whether they had the appropriate paperwork to move the children," he said Wednesday.
