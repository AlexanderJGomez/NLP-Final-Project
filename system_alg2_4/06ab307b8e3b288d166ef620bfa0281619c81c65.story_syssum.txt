And so it is.
Why it was, until Monday, our greatest day of the year.
That's why so many people descend on the marathon every year, and why so many people found themselves in harm's way.
To complete the celebration, Patriots Day marks the annual 11 a.m. Red Sox game at Fenway Park, an utterly local tradition concocted so baseball crowds wouldn't get in the way of marathon crowds.
These days, it's more of a pure spectacle, and I doubt many of those watching could name even one of the East African runners who have won in recent years.
It is, nevertheless, something that all of us here take pride in.
I am not privy to what sort of security arrangements go into planning the Boston Marathon, but there's only so much you can do along a 26.2-mile route that passes through seven cities and towns in addition to Boston.
And we are.
The Patriots Day tradition will continue.
