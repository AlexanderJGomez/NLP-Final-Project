The family behind  A&E's "Duck Dynasty" rallied around its patriarch Thursday, one day after the network suspended Phil Robertson over controversial remarks he made about gays and blacks in a magazine interview.
"We are disappointed that Phil has been placed on hiatus for expressing his faith, which is his constitutionally protected right.
That's just me.
But hey, sin: It's not logical, my man.
It's just not logical," he's quoted as saying.
It's not right."
"We are extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson's comments in GQ, which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not reflected in the series Duck Dynasty," the network said in a statement Wednesday.
The blacks worked for the farmers.
...
They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues," GQ quoted Robertson as saying.

But by early Thursday night, more than 70,000 people had signed a change.org petition calling for A&E to bring Robertson back.
Just because homosexuals do not agree, does not mean Mr. Robertson needs to be suspended."
"Duck Dynasty" follows a Louisiana bayou family that has "made a fortune on duck calls," as A&E puts it.
Robertson founded the Duck Commander company, "which sold a line of custom-made duck-hunting calls that quickly became popular among avid hunters for their uncanny accuracy in replicating the sound of a real duck," the GQ article states.
