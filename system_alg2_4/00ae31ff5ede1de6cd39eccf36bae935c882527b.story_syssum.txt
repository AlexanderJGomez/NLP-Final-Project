BEIJING, China (CNN) -- The head of China's quality watchdog is reported to have resigned over the tainted baby milk scandal that has killed four children and sickened nearly 53,000 others.
The crisis was initially thought to have been confined to baby milk powder, but tests have found melamine in samples of liquid milk taken from China's two largest dairy producers, Mengniu Dairy Group and Yili Industrial Group, as well as Shanghai-based Bright Dairy.
The scandal has spread beyond the mainland with melamine being found in three Chinese-made dairy products in Singapore.
Taiwan announced Monday it was banning the importation of all dairy products from China because of melamine contamination in milk supplies on the mainland, Taiwan's Health Ministry said Monday.
The Chinese premier visited Beijing hospitals and a supermarket Sunday to show his concern for the crisis.
Investigators arrested two brothers who sold milk used to produce the contaminated baby milk powder last week.
The raw milk had been watered down and the chemical added to fool quality checks, the newspaper said.
"Xinhua was quick to blame the dairy industry for their skewed rules, but what it didn't say was that the government also played a part in that ugly game," the magazine quoted a blogger, identified as sadmoon109, as saying.
