(CNN)Jami Smith Lane clearly remembers saying goodbye to her 14-year-old daughter, Sierra Wilder, for the last time.
And I said, 'I love you,'" Lane recalled.
The small plane carrying Sierra back home from vacation crashed Friday in western Kentucky.
At the same time, the family and the community in the small town of Nashville, Illinois, are still trying to come to terms with the loss of four beloved members.
Lane said the loss has taught her a powerful lesson that she hoped other people would take away from the disaster.
"We're helping each other out and leaning on each other," Lane said.
The other family members who died in the plane crash were Sierra's uncle and aunt, Marty and Kimberly Gutzler, and Piper, their 9-year-old daughter.
Piper also enjoyed "going to the beach and being with family," the obituary said.
And everyone knew him," Collins told CNN affiliate KFVS.
Kimberly Gutzler, 46, "loved her animals, traveling, painting and spending time with her family," according to her obituary.
"We're so saddened by the loss and are grieving the loss of Marty and Kim and Piper and Sierra."
