I am not in the position to say whether or not Pistorius's version of events is true.
But as an American who has been in the country for 20 years and lived in Johannesburg and Cape Town, I can speak about the unique mindset that comes from living behind high walls, particularly the kind of high walls Pistorius lived behind in his Pretoria security complex.
But the South African security complex like the one Pistorius owned offers the resident walls within walls.
My neighbors, like people in similar complexes in Johannesburg and indeed Pretoria, routinely left ground floor windows and doors to their residences wide open.
When I read that, my first thought was "full combat recon mode"?
Pistorius might have been on edge, but we in the body corporate sent out endless nagging e-mails to our far less combat ready complex dwellers urging them to lock their doors, close their windows, and set their alarms at night.
It seemed that nobody was even vaguely interested in going "full combat recon mode."
She had been strangled.
The guy was charged with murder but never went to trial.
