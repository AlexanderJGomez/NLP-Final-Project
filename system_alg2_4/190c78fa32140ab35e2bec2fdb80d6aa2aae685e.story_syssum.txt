New York (CNN) -- New York City will pay  more than $7 million to settle a civil lawsuit brought by the estate of a man killed by police outside a Queens' nightclub in 2006 and by his two friends, who were seriously wounded, a spokeswoman for the city's Law Department said Tuesday.
Undercover officers, who were investigating the club regarding prostitution allegations, said they identified themselves as police, but witnesses and the wounded men said they did not.
Bell, 23, was  African-American, as were the two men wounded and two of the three police  officers.
Questions of carelessness and incompetence must be left to other forums," Cooperman said, according to a transcript released by his office.
Al Sharpton  led a large protest in response to the Department of Justice decision.
"We will always pursue justice for the family of Sean Bell, Joseph Guzman  and Trent Benefield."
