(CNN) -- As debt-ridden Greece braces for strikes while its prime minister attempts to reassure Europe that his country will pay its bills, the 17 eurozone countries are in various stages of deciding whether to approve the expansion of Europe's bailout fund.
Here's a rundown of where the countries stand and the dates their governments approved (or are expected to approve) EFSF expansion.
The Cypriot cabinet has approved the measures and parliament is expected to ratify the EFSF expansion sometime during the first week of October.
While Portugal hasn't officially approved EFSF expansion, it is expected to within weeks -- the cash-strapped country is, after all, receiving financial assistance from the bailout fund.
Despite a no-confidence vote that brought down Slovenia's government last week, the parliament approved the expansion of the bailout fund on Tuesday.
Just weeks after opposition parties blocked the government's attempt to fast-track the EFSF bill, lawmakers approved EFSF enhancements that are expected to be officially ratified on September 30.
Europe's second largest economy was the first country to approve EFSF enhancement.
