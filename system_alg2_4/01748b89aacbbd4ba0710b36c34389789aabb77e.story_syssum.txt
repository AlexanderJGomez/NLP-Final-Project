(CNN) -- Twenty-five people were discharged from hospital Friday, state media reported, a week after a meteor exploded in spectacular fashion in the skies above Russia's Urals region, shattering glass in thousands of buildings.
The Chelyabinsk region, the hardest-hit area, asked federal authorities Monday for $16.6 million in aid, RIA Novosti said.
Meanwhile, the first fragment of meteorite arrived in Moscow on Friday for analysis, RIA Novosti reported.
The national space agency, Roscosmos, said scientists believe one meteoroid entered the atmosphere, where it burned and disintegrated into fragments.
The space agency put the amount of energy released in the meteor's explosion at nearly 500 kilotons.
"This is no exaggeration."
Kuznetsov said he experienced what felt like "a push," as a sound wave passed through his body.
"The terminal part of the explosion probably likely occurred almost directly over Chelyabinsk," said Detlef Koschny, of the European Space Agency.
