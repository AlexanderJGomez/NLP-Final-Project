A leading Italian soccer coach has called for stronger action against racism after a top-level match between AC Milan and Roma was suspended Sunday due to abusive chants by supporters.
"In my opinion, there's only one solution to racism in stadium and that's suspend the match," Allegri said on Milan's website.
People go to the stadium to watch the two teams but there's always these uncivilized people."
The Italian football authorities are battling to eradicate racism at matches, with several clubs having been fined for offenses.
FIFA president Sepp Blatter said he was "appalled" by the abuse at the Milan-Roma game.
The Italy international striker was also involved in another controversial incident during the Roma match, which ended up with teammate Sulley Muntari being sent off after manhandling the referee.
The draw mean third-placed Milan ended the weekend two points ahead of Fiorentina in the race to win a place in the qualifying rounds of the European Champions League next season, with one match still to play.
To miss out on the Champions League, Milan will have to lose next weekend's final match at relegated Siena, while Fiorentina must beat bottom club Pescara -- or win by more than four goals if the Rossoneri draw.
Udinese stayed fifth with a 2-1 win over Atalanta as Antonio Di Natale scored both goals to take his total this season to 22, keeping the striker second behind Cavani.
