Thanks to their pioneering use of the Internet to raise money and mobilize supporters in the 2004 and 2008 presidential campaigns, Democrats have gained a reputation in recent years as being ahead of Republicans in embracing digital tools.
Perhaps the most impressive display of their new tech-savvy direction is Project Madison, the nickname for a crowdsourcing platform that allows citizens to amend individual passages of legislation by adding or striking language.
The language of small government, reduced regulation, and transparency has helped galvanize conservatives to support the use of technological tools and technology-friendly legislation.
"Because technology has the potential of making government more efficient, less expensive to run, and more accountable, it's not surprising that the Republicans are ahead of the Democrats in the use of technology in governing," says Andrew Rasiej, founder and publisher of Tech President, a blog about the intersection of politics and technology.
This GOP commitment to technology has extended to social networks as well.
A recent study by Edelman Digital found that Republican members of Congress use Twitter more effectively than their Democratic counterparts.
Republicans have made a concerted effort to beef up their social-media presence since 2008, in part by recruiting tech-savvy staffers to train members of Congress in how to use social networks.
The system relays crucial data back to a team of statisticians, who then can reroute the entire organization to optimally target malleable voters.
