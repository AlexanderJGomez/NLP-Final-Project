A new CNN investigation reveals what most analysts have been saying since the "birther" controversy erupted during the 2008 presidential campaign: Obama was born in Hawaii on August 4, 1961.
The U.S. Constitution says only "natural born" citizens can become president -- a vague clause that some members of the birther movement contend disqualifies Obama because, they insist, he was born outside the United States.
Dr. Chiyome Fukino, a former director of the Hawaii Department of Health and a Republican, told CNN in her most extensive comments to date that she has "no doubt" Obama was born in the state.
"He was absolutely born here in the state of Hawaii."
Like Obama, Waidelich's birth was announced at the time in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin newspaper.
Could Obama's 1961 birth announcement in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin be a fake?
...
Obama could file a Freedom of Information Act request to view his original birth certificate and make copies.
He said he wants to find someone who saw Obama immediately after the president was born.
"Of course, we had no idea at the time that the future president of the United States was that little boy, that little baby," Abercrombie recalled.
She said there is "no way" Obama wasn't born in the state.
"She said, 'When I had Maya, it was a lot of more difficult because Indonesia doesn't believe in painkillers while you're giving birth.
"I find it a bit amusing in the sense that (the issue) keeps resurfacing over and over again," Fukino said.
"No matter what you do or say, it make no difference," she said.
