SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea fired several short-range missiles toward the Sea of Japan on Saturday, an act that the U.S. watched closely and South Korea called provocative.
South Korean intelligence estimates that North Korea has about 700 such missiles in its arsenal.
The first two missiles were fired about 8 a.m. and 8:30 a.m., Yonhap reported.
"The United States is aware of possible missile launches by North Korea.
Earlier this week analyst Daniel Pinkston said the reported test might be training for a future test but it could also just be a routine military exercise.
"It is worrisome to some degree, but it is different from a ballistic missile launch," said Pinkston, of the International Crisis Group in Seoul, South Korea.
