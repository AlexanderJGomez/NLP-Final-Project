Beijing (CNN) -- Like many mothers, Yan breastfeeds her child.
A cursory search for "breast milk" on 58.com, a Chinese online shopping platform, reveals no shortage of mothers offering to sell their breast milk.
According to Yan, the market price is around 5,000 RMB (US$814) for a month's supply.
After China's tainted milk powder scandal in 2008, many new mothers who were unable to produce enough breast milk for their infant resorted to buying formula overseas â€” most notably in Hong Kong.
"If I don't have enough breast milk I would prefer to purchase human breast milk, because I don't trust our milk powder," explained Fang Lu, a newlywed who is planning to start a family.
Some mothers may be turning to others' breast milk as an "safer" alternative but health experts say it doesn't come without risks.
The trend of mothers' buying human milk online is not limited to China.
In China, trading human breast milk online occupies a legal gray area.
"We need laws for the breast milk business."
I have excess breast milk and I want to help others -- and earn some money," she said.
