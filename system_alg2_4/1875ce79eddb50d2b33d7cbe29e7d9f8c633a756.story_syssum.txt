(CNN) -- British TV host Piers Morgan said taking over for retiring Larry King is like replacing Frank Sinatra's Las Vegas show.
Morgan will replace King's longtime show with "a candid, in-depth newsmaker interview program," CNN announced Wednesday.
Morgan's show, which was not named in the CNN news release, will air live on CNN-US at 9 p.m.
"Larry King would be it," Morgan said.
I find him fascinating.
Morgan, 45, began his journalism career as a newspaper reporter in the United Kingdom for The Wimbledon News.
His print journalism career continued beyond the Mirror, including a monthly interview column for GQ magazine.
Morgan also writes two regular columns for the Mail on Sunday newspaper, which he will continue.
