Why do they see beheadings as a fitting punishment?
King Abdullah, as the protector of Islam's most sacred religious sites and leader of Saudi Arabia, is widely considered an important role model for Muslims around the world.
Badawi is not the only Saudi who has faced punishment for his perceived views.
But the much more routine and widespread beheadings by Saudi Arabia get little scrutiny and condemnation.
The 82 executions in 2014 make Saudi Arabia a world leader in capital punishment.
If Saudi Arabia thinks publicly beheading people comports with Islamic religious teachings and deters those who also might want to criticize them or question their religion, why shouldn't ISIS?
There is probably little governments and policymakers can do to influence the ideology of extremist armed groups.
That includes the anti-ISIS coalition, to which Saudi Arabia and many other unaccountable, authoritarian, and deeply abusive Arab governments belong.
