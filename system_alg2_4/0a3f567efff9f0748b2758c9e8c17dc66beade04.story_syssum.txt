(CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Rahm Emanuel will bring a "tough-minded" and "pragmatic" approach to the White House when he becomes President-elect Barack Obama's chief of staff, according to people who know the Chicago, Illinois, native.
In the job, Emanuel would oversee the White House staff.
And he knows the White House.
He's got a deeply held set of views but he also understands to get things done you have to compromise," he said.

So I think the years have been good to him in that regard," McLarty said.
After reports that Emanuel had agreed to be Obama's chief of staff on Thursday, the top Republican in the House, Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio, questioned the president-elect's pick.
But David Gergen, a CNN senior political analyst who has worked in five administrations, said the contrasting styles between Obama and Emanuel could help the new president get things done in Washington.
... Barack Obama can be the good guy," Gergen said.
