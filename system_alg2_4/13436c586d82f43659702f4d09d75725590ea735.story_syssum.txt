But not all that money has been spent, and not all of it -- in fact, not even half of it -- is being directed to upstart green businesses.
The Department of Energy this June specified "33 clean energy projects" of a larger scale as part of its "loans program."
Accounting for things like that, a report from the Brookings Institution non-partisan think tank this April tabbed the total green stimulus spending at $51 billion.
In fact, of the 28 funded projects -- involving 23 companies -- listed in a 2012 congressional report, only four involve businesses that were either sold or are not in operation.
Most of the large projects that benefited from the Department of Energy loan program remain in operation -- contrary to Romney's assertion that "almost half" of them had closed.
