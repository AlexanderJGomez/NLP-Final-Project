On April 8, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg let the company's board of directors know he was about to spend $1 billion on hot photo start-up Instagram -- just hours before the deal was done, according to the Wall Street Journal.
"On balance, I'm not sure it's the best way to do business," said Ali Velshi, CNN's chief business correspondent.
Velshi, who over the course of his career covered the "tech bubble" of the late 1990s, said the whirlwind purchase may, in fact, be a last hurrah of sorts for Zuckerberg.
The Facebook board did vote to approve the deal, according to the Journal.
The board, one source said, "was told, not consulted."
Could that have made Zuckerberg overpay for a company with 13 employees and no revenue to date?
"That Zuckerberg felt strongly that he wanted Instragram may not have made him the best person to do the deal -- that's why we have real estate agents, or talent agents."
Matthew Braga of Ars Technica wrote, invoking the oft-paraphrased line from Facebook biopic "The Social Network."
