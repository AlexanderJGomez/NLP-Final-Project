Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Perhaps no one better understands what the family of U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is going through like the widow and children of Punjab Governor Salmaan Taseer.
Taseer was assassinated by his own security guard last week in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital.
Qadri confessed in court Monday that he killed Taseer because of his support to change the blasphemy laws.
Sara Taseer says, "The difference is in Pakistan, this is not a message just to my father or my family.
We are in a totally different situation.
People who support us can lose their own lives."
"It's because they fear for their lives," says Taseer's son Shehryar.
He has been cheered, and showered with rose petals on his way into court.
It makes me sick to my stomach," says Taseer's youngest daughter Shehrbano.
"There were over 200 lawyers who went and put garlands and rose petals around my father's assassin's neck.
"They have a sorry record of convictions.
Now his family is looking back at the life of Salmaan Taseer, a businessman and governor of one of the most-populated provinces in the world.
But on top of it all I say one thing: that he was a great father and even better husband."
His daughter Shehrbano says, "I hope his passing doesn't mean that the room for debate is over.
His son Shehryar says he refuses to back down from the causes his father stood for.
And daughter Sara says, "He had a liberal and progressive and secular vision.
This country needed people like him.
