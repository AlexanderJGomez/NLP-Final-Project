"Roberto did a great job, it's not easy to win the title after 43, 44 years," Pellegrini said.
"He shares the club's approach to football and our ambition to achieve onfield success, coordinating with the wider football support teams to ensure natural progression from the Academy to senior level," said Manchester City chief executive Ferran Soriano.
Defending its league title last season, City finished a distant second after failing to sign striker Robin van Persie, who went to Manchester United from Arsenal.
Pellegrini led Villarreal to a second-place finish in La Liga and the Champions League semifinals, while in his one season with Real Madrid, in 2009-2010, it amassed a then club record 96 points without winning any trophies.
In an effort to make up ground on United, City has already made two major signings in the off-season, acquiring Spanish winger Jesus Navas from Sevilla and Brazilian midfielder Fernandinho from Shakhtar Donetsk for a total believed to be $70 million.
His hiring completes managerial changes at the top three teams in the Premier League, after David Moyes replaced the retiring Alex Ferguson at Manchester United and Mourinho took over from Rafael Benitez at Chelsea.
Malaga, meanwhile, announced Friday that former Real Madrid manager Bernd Schuster would replace Pellegrini at La Rosaleda.
