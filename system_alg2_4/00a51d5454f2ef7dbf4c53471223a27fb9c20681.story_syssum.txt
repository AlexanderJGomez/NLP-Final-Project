(CNN)Marco Rubio is all in.
And unless he can offer new ideas, his climb to the Republican nomination will be steep.
Instead, Rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration.
Meanwhile, both the Deferred Action program and President Obama's executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favored by Hispanics.
But when it comes to Cuba policy, Rubio himself seems firmly stuck in the past.
Immigration and Cuba policy aside, Rubio's political philosophy will be a tough sell to Hispanics.
(In fact, Rubio signed his own family up for "Obamacare" on the Washington exchange, taking advantage of a generous federal subsidy offered to lawmakers.)
And though Rubio doubts that climate change is caused by humans, The New York Times has noted that Latinos view global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue.
By comparison, Rubio seems cautious and ill-suited to the task of rousing Republican voters.
Unfortunately, a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combination -- not for Rubio, and not for Latino voters.
