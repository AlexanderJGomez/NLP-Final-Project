The audit, released Thursday by Inspector General Glenn Fine, found the agents routinely submitted the overtime with the blessing of their managers from 2003 through 2007.
"The FBI inappropriately permitted employees to regularly claim overtime for activities that are not compensable as work, such as time spent eating meals, exercising more than 3 hours per week, and socializing," the report said.
FBI employees lived with sniper attacks, mortar fire, and roadside bombs as part of their daily work environment.
The inspector general's report said overtime pay was less excessive for FBI personnel in Afghanistan.
