My pick of the bunch, EZ Apps' $2.99 Hurricane Tracker offers detailed storm maps, National Hurricane Center info, threat level maps, audio/video forecast updates, real-time feeds and push alerts.
Developer Kitty Code's longstanding $2.99 hurricane-watching app (updated in June) offers a repository of global meteorological information, including tracking maps, satellite views, five-day forecasts, radar and bulletins from the National Hurricane Center.
If all you need is tracking for the Atlantic, Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and the Eastern and Central Pacific, Kitty Code offers Hurricane Express, a cheaper $0.99 version that eschews the app's global features, and if you're looking for the tablet-optimized version of Hurricane, Kitty Code offers Hurricane HD for $3.99, which adds "exclusive" video and blog updates from HurricaneTrack.com.
It's now out of beta — still free, though ad-littered (there's a $2.99 ad-free "Pro" version) — and packing hurricane data from the National Hurricane Center, high resolution maps, satellite images, warning information and storm tracks.
Last but not least, Hurricane -- American Red Cross for both Android or iOS is a newer, totally free addition to Android's growing hurricane-tracking stable, but it's more than just a tracker — this app lets you "monitor conditions in your area or throughout the storm track, prepare your family and home, find help and let others know you are safe even if the power is out."
