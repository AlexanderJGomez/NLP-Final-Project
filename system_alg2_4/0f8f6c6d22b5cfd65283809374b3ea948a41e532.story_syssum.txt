On Thursday, workers in Indiana and Kentucky finished sliding a new nearly half-mile-long, 30 million-pound bridge from one set of piers to another, making it the "longest bridge in North America -- and perhaps the world" -- to slide laterally into place, according to the Indiana Department of Transportation.
Then, they pulled the bridge from the temporary piers to the refurbished piers with steel cables and eight computer-controlled hydraulic jacks.
For drivers, it has two 12-foot-wide lanes and shoulders measuring 8 feet.
The old Milton-Madison Bridge was only one of more than a half-million aging bridges nationwide.
About 25% of them are classified as deficient, according to a 2013 report by the Federal Highway Administration.
