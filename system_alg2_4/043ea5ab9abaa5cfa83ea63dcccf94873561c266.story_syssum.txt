He is covered with bandages; a ventilator breathes for Michael Brewer because he can't do it for himself.
"People are writing horror stories ... but people just can't imagine the kind of sickness we're talking about," said Dr. Nicholas Namias, medical director of the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center in Miami.
Police say the bicycle was stolen because Brewer did not pay one of the boys $40 for a video game.
According to police, witnesses said the teens called Brewer "a snitch" as they used a lighter to set him ablaze.
His contribution to the breathing is trivial," Namias said.
On Monday, the five teens who are accused of taking part in the attack appeared separately before judges in Broward County, Florida.
The 13-year-old also could be charged as an adult but under Florida law only if Brewer dies.
"There's no evolutionary mechanism to survive a 65 percent burn," Namias said.
... Our expectation is survival."
"It's understandable that people can be burned in accidents," Namias said.
This didn't have to happen at all."
