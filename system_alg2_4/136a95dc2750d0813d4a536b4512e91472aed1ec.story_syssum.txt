The Malaysian-registered tanker Zafirah was exactly the kind of ship pirates love.
Fortunately for the owners and crew of the Zafirah, good regional cooperation and information sharing led to the rescue of the crew and, after a 50-minute stand off with Vietnam's Marine Police, the recovery of the vessel and the arrest of the pirates.
While piracy in Somalia in the waters off the Horn of Africa may have grabbed the headlines over the past few years, shipping industry experts say piracy is moving back to its former heartland in South East Asia.
According to the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP) -- an information sharing center set up under a regional Asian agreement to combat piracy -- the high price of oil has been behind at least four pirate attacks in 2011 and 2012 where diesel or MGO fuel was siphoned.
"There are many new companies making good money providing 'hardening' equipment for ships," the Hong Kong-based source said.
Some ships operating in Somali waters have even resorted to 'citadels'; safe rooms where the crew can barricade themselves into a ship that has already been boarded by pirates.
According to statistics from the International Chamber of Commerce International Maritime Bureau, there have been 22 attacks in 2013 of which nine took place in waters around South East Asia.
While Asian attacks tend to be of a less serious nature -- ranging from petty thefts of engine parts to large-scale thefts of valuable cargoes -- the maritime industry says ship owners, faced with increasing costs and lower revenues due to the global financial crisis, have cut the size of crews and in some cases their wages, a situation that leaves the door open to piracy.
