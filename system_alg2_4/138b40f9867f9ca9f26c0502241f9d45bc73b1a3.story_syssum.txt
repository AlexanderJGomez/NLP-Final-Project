"It's hard to dream when everyone says the place you come from only spawns 'jihadists, terrorists and delinquents,'" the 21-year-old says.
Grigny is the hometown of Amedy Coulibaly, who killed a policewoman as well as four hostages at a kosher supermarket in Paris two weeks ago.
She believes the use of provocative language only further alienates the people living in the banlieues.
You stop feeling like an individual and begin to think you're reduced to a crime-ridden town," Diarra says.
Rio grew up in the concrete maze that is the Grande Borne -- the same housing project as Coulibaly.
Rio says it's easy to overlook the success stories of the banlieues in favor of tales of homegrown terrorists, but that not everyone from his town is a criminal.
The average net annual income in Grigny is 9,600 euros, according to Rio -- the lowest in the Paris region.
The mayor also believes that better education will help bridge the gap between the banlieues and the state, the "us and them" mentality.
His small office in Grande Borne is littered with photos of smiling children that he has helped guide into adulthood.
Aka believes one of the reasons Coulibaly might have formed a relationship with hardened criminals when he was in jail was because he didn't fit into life outside the prison walls, despite desperately wanting to be part of a community.
"He befriended a bunch of idiots and became himself an idiot," Amad told French radio RMC.
"We feel like we're alone, and when we talk about the banlieues we only talk about its problems and never about the opportunity the banlieues represent today," El Jarroudi says.
"To have a future you need to believe in yourself, but you also need others to believe in you," she says.
