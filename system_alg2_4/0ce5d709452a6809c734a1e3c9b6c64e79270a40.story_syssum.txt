The signs note that the mayor "will not be served in this establishment" and "We believe women should be treated with respect."
And now a city councilman wants him to answer questions about more than $500 in charges on his official city credit card from a downtown hotel.
"When you see statements like this, it raises the question of is city business being done or not," Councilman Kevin Faulconer said Tuesday.
He said Filner has promised to reimburse the city for that trip, but there has been no proof of a refund.
Filner issued a required response to the notice of a petition drive Tuesday, arguing that voters should weigh his administration's push for new parks, high-tech jobs, better roads and a 2024 Olympic bid before they decide to whether they want to turn him out of office.
"San Diegans want a mayor that doesn't grope and demean women, who doesn't abuse his office to satisfy a perverted quest for a sense of power, and who has the ability to lead our great city -- an ability Filner can never, ever reclaim."
But he also said he will be vindicated by "a full presentation of the facts" and he will not resign.
He'll continue with outpatient treatment, Payne said -- but he might not be back at work in his office anytime soon.

Saldana said she brought complaints about Filner to San Diego County's Democratic Party leader two years ago after hearing accounts of harassing behavior from six women.
And I think people need to pay attention to those reports, and it didn't happen two years ago," said Saldana, also a Democrat.
"I deal with frustrated travelers every day, but I never came across anyone like Bob Filner," she said.
