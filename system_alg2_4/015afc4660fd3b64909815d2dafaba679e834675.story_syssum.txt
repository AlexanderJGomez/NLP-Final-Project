Greece had one of the worst budget deficits in the developed world last year, at 12.7 percent of gross domestic product, more than three times higher than previously declared due to accounting irregularities -- or what some call outright fraud.

The New York Times reported recently that some of these same banks also were making side bets that Greece would default on loans it owes American banks and hedge funds.
Bernanke noted the similarity of the situation of banks making bets to hedge against Greek debt to banks that made bets to hedge against real estate debt, which imploded AIG.
"Enough is enough," he told an audience at the Brookings Institution on Monday.
