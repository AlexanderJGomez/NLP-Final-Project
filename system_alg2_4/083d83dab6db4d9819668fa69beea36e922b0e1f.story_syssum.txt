(CNN) -- Jurors in Portland, Oregon, awarded a former Boy Scout $1.4 million after finding Tuesday that the organization was negligent in allowing a Scout leader who was a sex offender to have contact with him.
How the Scouts handled the case of the former Scout leader, Timur Dykes, was at the center of the explosive lawsuit.
Once the Scouts did learn about it, the organization acted immediately and cooperated with police, the Scouts' lawyers said.
A Boy Scouts spokesman has acknowledged the organization does have confidential files, but said they are made confidential in order to protect people who are ineligible to be Scout leaders but who may not have done anything illegal.
"We believe that the allegations made against our youth protection efforts are not valid."
While holding the Boy Scouts of America 60 percent negligent, the jury said the Cascade Pacific Council -- which oversees Scouting activities in the region -- was 15 percent negligent and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints 25 percent negligent.
Steve English, a lawyer representing the church, said Tuesday's verdict has no impact on the church, since it settled the case out of court more than a year ago.
