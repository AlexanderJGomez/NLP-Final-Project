(CNN) -- Virender Sehwag plundered the second-fastest Test double hundred as India piled on an incredible 443-1 off just 79 overs on the second day of the deciding third match against Sri Lanka in Mumbai.
That brought Sehwag and inexperienced opener Murali Vijay to the crease, and they launched a blistering attack on the Sri Lankan bowlers putting on 221 in just 39 overs.
The explosive Sehwag, who made 131 in India's innings victory in Kanpur, then found another solid partner in Rahul Dravid, who calmly fed him the strike in his patient 62 off 121 balls.
I thought I would bide my time, see off the new ball and then take my chances."
The 37-year-old, who has taken 788 Test wickets, conceded 119 runs off his 20 overs.
The player, who missed the Ashes defeat to England, has taken 310 Test wickets in 76 matches and 324 one-day scalps in 186 appearances.
