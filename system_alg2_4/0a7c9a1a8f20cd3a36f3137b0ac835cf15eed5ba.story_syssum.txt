(CNN) -- Help trickled in Thursday, three days after a magnitude-7.7 earthquake struck off Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that has killed at least 311 people and left more than 400 missing.
The hard-hit Mentawai Islands region is among Indonesia's myriad islands.
"The worst hit area is North and South Pagai Island.
Monday's quake generated a "significant" tsunami, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said.
The quake struck at 9:42 p.m. Monday, triggering a tsunami warning.
Preliminary report indicates the destructive waves hit the Mentawai Islands after five minutes.
Indonesia's government has since warned residents of West Sumatra province to stay alert and stay away from the coastline for up to five days because of the possibility of more earthquakes, Balanda said.
A tsunami generated by that earthquake killed more than 225,000 people in 14 countries -- mainly India, Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand.
