Venus Williams steps off the tennis court and into the pool in a series of photos to be featured in Italian Marie Claire.
"I love working with Koto," Venus told CNN in an interview for "Revealed."
"I've got it pictured in my mind that she's going to be playing tennis underwater," Bolofo told CNN.
Fashion is an important part of Venus Williams' life.
She sketches ideas, but says she's not the chief designer, by any stretch.
Despite her public business interests, Venus told CNN she's not interested in seizing the spotlight for any reason other than as one of the world's best tennis players.
My goals have always been to excel in tennis, and to win championships.
"When I'm inspired by an individual I just write a song about them ...
I love it," she told CNN.
