(CNN) -- It's the height of summer in Paris, and the director of the most famous art museum in the world is queuing like any other tourist.
Why?
"I hope it will be more welcoming, which means that when you arrive at the museum there are less queues, that the people of foreign origin find reference points in their language, that with the help of Wi-Fi and apps you understand what you see," he said.
What threatens museums is that it is only an elite which understands the works of art.
Described by colleagues as a "quiet intellectual with a penchant for tweed and sweater vests," Martinez says the first time he visited the gallery as an 11-year-old on a school trip, it revolutionized his view of the world.
How?
Opened last year, the gleaming new building displays around 200 pieces on loan from Paris.
"No," says Martinez.
With Martinez at the helm, it's also the beginning of a brave new era for the beloved institution.
