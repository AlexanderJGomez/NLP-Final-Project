As higher chicken feed costs push multi-national chicken firms like Pilgrim's Pride and Tyson's Food to report losses this year, Abdel Hadi says crayfish waste is an alternative source for the protein and minerals necessary to raise chickens.
Abdel Hadi earned her PhD exploring the use of crayfish as chicken feed.
As a result, Abdel Hadi says, her experiments show that chickens raised on a crayfish feed diet lay more, stronger, higher-protein eggs.
Crayfish skeletons will have calcium and I'm sure there is a nutritional value but perhaps [feeding crayfish to chickens] is a leap too far for now," Humphries says.
Scientists like Dr. Madgy Khalil, who also works at Ain Shams University, say there are unprecedented numbers of crayfish thriving in the Nile with no natural predator, from the Mediterranean Sea or from the south of Egypt.
However, it could be better for a niche market," he says.
