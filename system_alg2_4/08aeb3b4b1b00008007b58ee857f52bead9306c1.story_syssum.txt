The short answer?
iPad books ultimately sold for closer to $12.99; as part of their deal with Apple, publishers only offered their books to other retailers at the same prices.
Amazon wasted no time suggesting that its prices will be dropping soon.
That, too, will presumably lead to lower prices.
Calling Amazon "the Darth Vader of the literary world," Turow said in an op-ed piece for Bloomberg last month that an Apple lawsuit would tilt the field too far in Amazon's favor.
The current landscape "looks like a more robust and competitive market, as opposed to the world we will be left with if the Justice Department paves the way for Amazon to return to its predatory practices," Turow wrote.
