After Obama sends his 2012 plan to Capitol Hill, House and Senate budget committees each pass their own budget resolutions, which set caps on spending and establish revenue targets and generally serve as five- to 10-year blueprints for congressional priorities.
The budget resolutions also allocate how much may be spent on broad budget functions like defense and education but not individual programs.
Education is one of the few areas to get a significant increase in funding: $4.5 billion more than in his 2011 budget.
The plan increases the Pentagon's base budget to $553 billion, $22 billion more than last year.
The plan provides $13.4 billion in discretionary resources in 2012, a $1.3 billion decrease from 2010.
It reduces construction spending and redirects those funds for care and benefits to veterans.
Obama's plan budgets $12 billion, which is roughly the same as in previous years, and increases land and water conservation programs.
Foreign assistance to several countries is cut.
