(CNN) -- A British report issued Thursday called for "decisive action" to contain the growing problem of piracy off the coast of Somalia.
Though some ships have begun taking "more robust" measures to defend themselves, pirates still face few repercussions for their actions, it said.
"They will maneuver one of the skiffs to come alongside the vessel and they will throw up a line on a hook, a grappling rope or some form of apparatus by which they can climb up on to the freeboard of the ship.
Negotiations are typically carried out by satellite phone and usually take three months to a year, it said.
Though most hostages are released unharmed, 15 died last year, it said.
In a statement, Foreign Secretary William Hague said the report will be discussed next month at a meeting in London.
