Police found six people -- two men, two women and two boys -- dead in a home in a north Memphis neighborhood Monday, said Memphis police Lt. Joe Scott.
Three other children who were wounded in the home were taken to a hospital.
"We need the community's help," he said.
The four dead adults were shot and the two dead children were stabbed, sources told CNN affiliate WMC-TV.
At least one of the wounded children also was stabbed, police told the Commercial Appeal newspaper.
"I heard about six or seven shots," said Wayne Bolden, a landscaper who said he lives across the street from the home where the killings occurred.
Monday, he saw many police cars at the home and heard about the killings, he said.
He said he had been asked by the police to counsel the family members of the victims.
"We just don't know the motive or cause of death, but we do have four adults and two children [dead]," Memphis police Lt. Jerry Guin told the paper.
"It's kind of surprising, actually.
"It's sad you come home to find out something like this has gone on," Baker said.
"I've been on a scene where there were one or two or three [victims], but I don't remember anything this large," Guin told the Commercial Appeal.
