CNN Heroes salutes the following people who responded to Saturday's shooting at a political event outside a supermarket in Tucson, Arizona -- a shooting that killed six people and wounded 14 others, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords -- with acts of courage.
He hit the ground when the shooting started and felt a sting on the back of his head -- he'd been grazed by a bullet.
When the suspect was on the ground, another person took a gun away from him, Badger said.
Various people kept the gunman down for a few minutes until authorities arrived.
Zamudio was one of the people who helped keep the suspect pinned to the ground after he had been taken down.
Maisch said that she dropped to the ground when the shooting started.
The suspect had pulled the clip out of his pocket, Maisch said.
Hernandez, a 20-year-old University of Arizona junior, had just started as an intern with Giffords' staff that week.
...
The entire time I was with the congresswoman, she was still responding," Hernandez said.
I think the people who are heroes are people like Gabby, who have dedicated their lives to public service," he said.
Rayle was one of the people who helped hold the suspect down after the takedown.
"I looked up just as the gunman was firing the shot at Congresswoman Giffords.
After the suspect was brought down, Rayle helped to restrain him.
That's basically the treatment; there's not much else you can do," Rayle said .
