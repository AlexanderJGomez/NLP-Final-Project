Speaking on national television, Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva made the admission a day after he rejected a call from anti-government protesters to dissolve the country's parliament in 30 days.
The demand from the anti-government protesters, known as the "Red Shirts," was the latest in a long list issued since the group stormed parliament in early April and Abhisit declared a state of emergency.
Other conditions that must be met before any negotiations could take place include having protest leaders make sure there will be no further expansion of demonstrations into other districts and no threats to government officers, the government spokesman said.
The Red Shirts have been clashing with the Thai military in a Bangkok area that serves as a financial hub.
Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban said in a televised address that the grenades were launched from the area where the Red Shirts have been encamped for weeks, but the protesters denied any responsibility for the attacks.
The official said authorities would suppress the terrorists at the appropriate time, but did not want to complicate the situation by trying to take action against them now.
The attacks prompted the U.S. State Department to issue a travel alert advising American citizens of the escalating violence in Bangkok.
Some fear that the emergence of such groups could spark a civil war.
He said the Thai are all one people and this shouldn't be happening.
