Washington (CNN) -- It was my first chance to spend some quality time at dinner with First Lady Michelle Obama, so I decided to do what my pal Ali Velshi would probably do in the same situation: get her hooked on Twitter.
Besides, she said, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs would have to sign off first.
Noting that Gibbs was sitting at the other end of the head table, I stood and told the first lady I'd ask him.
I assured the first lady I would not tell her a fib, which prompted Leno to jump to his feet to say he'd go get Gibbs to sort this out once and for all.
Gibbs, who was looking over our shoulders, suggested that I type it out, so I told Mrs. Obama to start dictating the note.
I started my typing "from flotus," as in "first lady of the United States."
She asked Gibbs for his opinion on what she had dictated, and he said the proper way to say it was that it was her first tweet.
Some of my followers were particularly amused that Mrs. Obama referred to her husband as "the potus" -- as in the president of the United States -- and started re-tweeting it.
Besides, I'm hoping Mrs. Obama will follow me, and not Velshi, since I hooked her up with her first tweet.
