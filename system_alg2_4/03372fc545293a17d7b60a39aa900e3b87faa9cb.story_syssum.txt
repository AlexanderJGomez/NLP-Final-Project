But Schaefer realized it wouldn't be enough.
"I want [the children] to learn, to get something out of their life."
Schaefer ultimately raised more than $250,000 for the school, which was completed in 2006.

Schaefer still sets aside her tips and wages to support her school and has kept up her fundraising efforts to buy supplies.

"I've learned from Lidia that even if the project is big, if your heart is in it, you can do it."
