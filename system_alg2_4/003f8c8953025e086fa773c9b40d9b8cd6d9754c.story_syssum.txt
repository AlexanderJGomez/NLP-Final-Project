Savana Redding was 13 when administrators suspected that she was carrying banned drugs.
The justices concluded that the search was unreasonable but that individual school administrators could not be sued.
Whether the school district would be liable was not an issue before the high court.
During an investigation into pills found at the school, a student told the vice principal that Redding had given her prescription-strength 400-milligram ibuprofen pills.
A search of Redding's backpack found nothing.
"The strip search was the most humiliating experience I have ever had," Redding said in an affidavit.
That court said the school went too far in its effort to create a drug- and crime-free classroom.
"And, common sense is not a judicial monopoly or a constitutional imperative."
In 1985, the high court allowed the search of a student's purse after she was suspected of hiding cigarettes.
"When parents send their kids to school, they can now breathe a sigh of relief they will not end up naked before school officials," Wolf said .
Redding, now 19, said she has never gotten over her experience.
