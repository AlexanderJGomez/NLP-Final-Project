(CNN) -- Photographer Thomas Nybo has captured images of some of the toughest issues facing Africa, from child mortality to access to education.
At the same center he met a boy who was carrying his sister on his back.
"It was the first time I'd seen a boy of his age in Africa wearing make up," he added.
One of the toughest places Nybo says he visited was a center for malnutrition in Niger.
