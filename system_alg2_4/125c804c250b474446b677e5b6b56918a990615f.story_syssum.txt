Madrid (CNN) -- Unions at Spain's flagship airline Iberia began a second week of strikes on Monday, with 1,300 flights canceled and most passengers re-assigned to other flights.
The strike began February 18, running from Monday to Friday, and Iberia said it lost about $19 million that week.
"There could be a strike during Easter Week and there could be an indefinite strike every Monday and Friday," Manuel Atienza, of the General Workers Union (UGT), told CNN on Monday.
Since then, the police presence has been increased at the airport's Terminal 4, where Iberia and British Airways flights are based.
Unions say that Iberia has been suffering since 2011, as the junior partner in the merger, while majority shareholder British Airways has expanded.
