And so let us review the Cheney record: No vice president has done more damage to our country, not even Vice President Aaron Burr, who shot and killed Alexander Hamilton 210 years ago.
Instead, he ignored the problem, the Cheney terror task force never met, and the warnings about an impending terrorist attack were ignored.
From there, it was off to the races, as Cheney did and said anything to drag America into a war with Iraq.
He said Saddam had "an established relationship with al Qaeda."
Wrong.
Wrong.
Wrong and wrong.
Regardless of whether Cheney is a liar or a fool, thousands of heroic American troops are dead.
I know that powerful people don't like admitting error.
Plain and simple."
He did not mention the death and devastation he brought to Iraq or that he and others ignored the terror threat before 9/11.
Were it not for the tragedies of 9/11 and Iraq, perhaps the thing Cheney would be remembered for was that he was the second vice president to shoot a man, albeit Cheney's was in a hunting accident and Harry Whittington, thank God, survived.
(He claims to have had only one beer, but even one is too many when you're hunting.)
