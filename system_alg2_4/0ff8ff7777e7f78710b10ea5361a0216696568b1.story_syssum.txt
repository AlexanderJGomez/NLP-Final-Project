(CNN)Every time a snowstorm bears down on Danbury, Connecticut -- which has happened a lot this winter -- students and parents turn to Twitter to find out whether schools will be closed.
Boughton always gets around to the real news eventually.

"That's who I am.
"Because as a parent I don't have time for Twitter."
