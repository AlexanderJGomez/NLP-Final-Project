They matched any gene variations they found in the DNA with study participants' individual symptoms.
"Complex diseases, such as schizophrenia, may be influenced by hundreds or thousands of genetic variants that interact with one another in complex ways," the study authors wrote in their introduction.
A study published in July showed as many as 108 genes may be tied to the mental health disorder.
Then they identified 42 interactive SNP sets that significantly increased people's risk of schizophrenia, according to the study.
The idea that schizophrenia is not one single disorder is not really new, says Dr. Charles Raison, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Arizona.
"Schizophrenia is probably 80 different diseases," Raison says.
There may be 10 separate gene mutations, but they might only express themselves as one or two symptoms.
Several things can cause pleurisy, including a viral infection, pneumonia or cancer.
The same could hold true for schizophrenia and other mental health conditions, Raison says.
