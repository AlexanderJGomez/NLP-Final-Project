Madeline Loftus, 24, was killed aboard Flight 3407.
She was returning to Buffalo State College to play in a reunion hockey game on Saturday, to meet up with her old classmates to play the game she loved so dearly.
Breaking down in tears, she said the game was filled with sadness because "Maddy wasn't here."
Loftus' No.
Loftus, 24, of Parsippany, New Jersey, played two seasons at Buffalo State from 2002 to 2004 before transferring to St. Mary's University in Minnesota after her sophomore year.
She will always hold a special place in my heart," said Terry Mannor, St. Mary's women's hockey coach.
About 1,000 people gathered at a church in western New York Monday to remember the crash victims.
The community memorialized the 50 victims, with religious leaders from Christian, Jewish, Muslim and Hindu communities offering words of sympathy to the community.
All 49 passengers and crew members aboard the 74-seat turboprop were killed when the plane crashed into a home in Clarence Center, New York, on Thursday night.
After Sean's death, Eckert co-founded Voices of September 11, an advocacy group for survivors of the attacks and families of those killed.
This would have been her first time on the ice with her former Buffalo State teammates since her playing days.
So passionate about hockey, Loftus was the first female to play on the boys' team in high school.
"Maddy was enthusiastic about life and especially about women's hockey."
