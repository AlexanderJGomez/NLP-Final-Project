Legislation to allow same-sex marriage in England and Wales won passage Tuesday in the House of  Commons.
Cameron backs the bill but his commitment to it has put him at odds with many in his own party and its grassroots supporters.
The bill was kept on track Monday thanks to the support of members of the opposition Labour Party, who voted to oppose an amendment that many Conservative rebels backed.
The issue of same-sex marriage has exposed painful divisions within Cameron's party, with many lawmakers already fractious over his position on Europe.
The Conservative Party faces a political threat from the UK Independence Party, which has vowed to take Britain out of Europe.
On Saturday, French President Francois Hollande signed into law a bill allowing marriage and adoption for same-sex couples despite vocal opposition from many conservatives and the Catholic Church.
Many countries remain split over the issue.
On the other side, many states have specific laws blocking same-sex couples from legally marrying.
