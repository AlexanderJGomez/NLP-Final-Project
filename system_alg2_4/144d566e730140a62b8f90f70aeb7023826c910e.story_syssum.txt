Russia had looked set for a second successive victory that would have sealed their place in the last eight, thanks to Alan Dzagoev's third goal of the tournament.
Earlier, Czech Republic had kept their qualification hopes alive with a deserved 2-1 win over Greece, who can still qualify for the knockout stages if they beat Russia in their final game.
Either way, as it had been in their first game against Poland, Greece's first-half luck was completely out.
Having fought back from a goal down and with only 10 men in their first game against Poland, Greece looked set to stage another second-half revival.
The victory means Bilak's Czech side now have three points from two Group A games, but leaves Greece knowing that only a win against Russia in their final group game will give them any chance of reaching the knockout stages.
Instead, it was Russia who took control eight minutes before half-time.
Malafeev had no chance with that strike but rescued his side on three other occasions to ensure that Russia stay top of Group A -- but with everything to play for in Saturday's final round of group matches.
