Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's former security chief testified that he worried at times that the singer might overdose on drugs, but he didn't think he was an addict.
Jackson called him between 20 and 30 times from his hotel room "in the middle of the night," LePerruque testified.
He appeared to be intoxicated, he said.
Did he think he was addicted to drugs?
He also never witnessed Jackson take medications, he said.
LePerruque said he never confronted Jackson about his drug use because he "didn't want to put him on the defensive."
The incidents of slurred speech and incoherent late night phone calls did not happen over the entire time LePerruque worked with Jackson, he said.
He told of one conversation in which Jackson told him he was not going to use drugs again.
"He said that as an artist he always had a tune in his head, different melodies, and he wasn't able to stop it," La Perruque said.
LaPerruque said Jackson was "very devastated" by what he thought was the betrayal of trust he had with Bashir.
LaPerruque said he never believed the criminal charges against Jackson were true.
LaParruque called Jackson "very down to earth," saying he was proud to have worked for him.
The wrongful death trial begins its 15th week in a Los Angeles courtroom Monday.
