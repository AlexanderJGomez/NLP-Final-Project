WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The director of Federal Emergency Management Agency on Sunday defended giving away an estimated $85 million in hurricane relief supplies, blaming Louisiana officials for turning down the stockpiles.
They said, 'No, we don't need them.'
The material was declared surplus property and offered to federal and state agencies -- including Louisiana, where groups working to resettle hurricane victims say the supplies are still needed.
John Medica, director of the Louisiana's Federal Property Assistance Agency, told CNN he was unaware Katrina victims still needed the items because no agency had contacted his office.
States, meanwhile, were requesting those items, he said.
And in a phone interview with CNN, McIntyre said, "That is property that was purchased in response to Katrina.
