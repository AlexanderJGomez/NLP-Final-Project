Vicksburg, Mississippi (CNN) -- Early signs of recovery mixed with stormy forecasts Friday, as residents struggled to dig out of the most significant flood to hit the lower Mississippi River valley in more than 70 years.
Severe storms are likely Saturday and Sunday in the Mississippi River, Ohio River and Tennessee River valleys, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris.
Others celebrated.
We're probably 200 people more than we usually are," Monsour told CNN affiliate WJTV.
"(I'm) just here to celebrate the river cresting," Roland said.
All but about a dozen of Eagle Lake's 600 residents evacuated, according to CNN affiliate WLBT.
Local officials caution that some area residents may have to wait to return to their homes.
Residents who live along the river should be vigilant, said Marty Pope, a senior hydrologist with the weather service.
The Mississippi River is more than 14 feet above flood stage at Vicksburg and more than a foot over the record set in the city in 1927.
The river stood at 61.9 feet Thursday night, and the crest isn't expected till Saturday.
A slide was detected on the mainline Mississippi levee at Albemarle Lake, the Corps of Engineers said Thursday.
So far, the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development has delivered nearly 150,000 sandbags, 30,000 cubic yards of sand and 33,000 linear feet of fabric-lined baskets, the governor's office said.
It will be weeks before the river falls below flood stage, allowing evacuees to return.
About five miles of the Mississippi River at Baton Rouge were closed Friday after four barges broke loose from a towboat, said Seaman William Benson of the U.S. Coast Guard.
