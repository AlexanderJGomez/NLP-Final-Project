Yet this tale has taken a sudden and unexpected twist: The killer got a pardon and a hero's welcome.
The parole has exacerbated long-standing tensions over disputed land between Armenia and Azerbaijan, former Soviet republics that are nestled in the Caucasus region near Turkey, Iran and Russia.
Thomas de Waal, an expert on the Caucasus with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told CNN world energy markets would be disrupted in a conflict since an oil and a gas pipeline carrying Caspian oil curves around the conflict zone in Azerbaijan.
Not long after Safarov arrived in Azerbaijan, though, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev pardoned him.
The United States, meanwhile, was among those nations objecting to the pardon.
Sabine Freizer, director of the International Crisis Group's Europe program, said world powers have taken note.
Animosities over the disputed territory have simmered since the end of World War I.
The disputes between the countries over Nagorno-Karabakh and other territories remain an "unresolved conflict of the Soviet period," Freizer said.
And Azerbaijan's oil and gas wealth is making its way into the budget for a military preparing for war, Freizer said.
Hungary defended its extradition and said it received assurances the killer would carry out his term.
Russia fought a brief war with Georgia four years ago and has battled Islamic insurgents in its northern Caucasus region in recent years.
Azerbaijan has strong military links with Turkey and they (Armenia and Azerbaijan) are both on the border with Iran," de Waal said.
He called the events a "black week" for a peaceful resolution to the conflict and said it's "now a full-blown state-to-state row, with as yet knowable consequences."
De Waal said diplomats must work harder now.
