Instead, NASA is buying services from U.S. industry.
But the designs will still be those of Boeing and SpaceX and vetted by NASA.
Beginning with the NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services competition, continuing with the Commercial Resupply Services (cargo) and now the Commercial Crew selection, NASA "bet the farm" on commercial companies filling the gap left by the retirement of the space shuttle, with the Commercial Crew companies (SpaceX and Boeing) replacing the Russians in bringing NASA astronauts to the ISS.
As an aerospace professional and former NASA executive, I have encountered over the decades many concepts for private space exploration.
This in turn will enable a robust new business enterprise and allow NASA to focus on Mars -- the ultimate target for exploration.
