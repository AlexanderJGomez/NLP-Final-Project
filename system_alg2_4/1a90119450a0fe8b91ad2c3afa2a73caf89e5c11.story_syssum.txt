For someone who makes a living out of communications, I have consistently been tongue-tied around Nelson Mandela.
However, with Madiba (as Mandela is often called), I feel like every moment spent with him is a gift, a blessing that I will tell my grandchildren about one day.
I always land up somehow embarrassing myself when I am around him; I've slipped on shiny presidential floors, got tangled up in camera equipment and made pathetically inane comments.
He said to me, "You are so gracious, I am so humbled to meet you."
I was the one humbled.
The one I remember most was around a birthday or Christmas during which there was a photo opportunity at one of his grandson's kindergartens.
Mandela just happened to be an honorary fellow at Magdalene College, where I was studying.
And then I turned to my awe-struck friends and said, "Did you know his favorite song is 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star?'"
( I didn't.
It isn't very gracious).
That's a complete no-no around Mandela -- his eyes were damaged during his years of imprisonment on Robben Island and flash photography is forbidden.
I never thought I'd meet him again, up close and personal, until, last year when Zelda, ever the diplomat, like her boss, invited to me to introduce my newly born daughter, Freya, to him.
The ones we sent to friends (and everybody we knew), show us laughing with the world's greatest statesman.
She freaked out some more.
