Gary Lamont Sumner faces a murder charge for his alleged role in the deaths of Byrd and Melanie Billings on Thursday, Escambia County, Florida, Sheriff David Morgan said.
The crime was "a very well-planned and methodical operation," Morgan said.
Coldiron and the younger Gonzalez face charges of murder, robbery and residential home invasion; the elder Gonzalez faces charges of evidence tampering for allegedly trying to disguise a vehicle spotted at the home.
Authorities released two surveillance tapes taken from the front and rear of the Billingses' home.
Melanie Billings' biological daughter, Ashley Markham, told reporters the couple initially had 17 children -- two biological children each for Byrd and Melanie Billings, with the rest adopted.
Nine of the couple's children were home at the time of the incident, Morgan said, and police believe three of them saw the intruders.
One of the first three arrested is believed to be the mastermind behind the crime, Morgan said, but would not say which one.
Two of the people in the photo are Sumner and the younger Gonzalez, but authorities want to know who the other man is, Morgan said.
"It leads me to believe that this was a very well-planned and methodical operation," Morgan said.
Asked whether the suspects entered the home planning to kill the couple, Morgan said authorities do not know.
Markham said earlier the family does not know any of the three suspects.
