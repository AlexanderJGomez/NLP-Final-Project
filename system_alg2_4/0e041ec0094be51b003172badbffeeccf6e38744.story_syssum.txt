But recent polls have shown Americans are very reluctant to support military interventions in Syria.
To better predict whether the U.S. will intervene in Syria, or any other similar crisis, we must understand why Washington selectively engages in humanitarian intervention missions.
We analyzed public opinion polls and congressional votes during four episodes of humanitarian intervention -- Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia and Kosovo -- and found, as recent debates seems to suggest, humanitarian intervention is mired in the mundane world of politics.
The public is generally supportive of humanitarian missions.
Humanitarian intervention is most likely when the U.S. president enjoys a majority in Congress.
This does not mean, however, that humanitarian intervention will only occur when a president enjoys a majority in Congress.
Congress was similarly bypassed in October 2011 when the administration deployed military advisers to Uganda.
For those eager to craft a uniform and effective international response to humanitarian crises as in Syria, they must first turn their attention to domestic politics.
