Everyone has the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.
Individuals with mutations in either of these genes have increased cancer risks, most notably for breast and ovarian cancer.
BRCA testing is a genetic test that looks at the sequence or code of the BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 genes.
A positive test result in BRCA1 or BRCA2 means that the person has a genetic mutation that increases cancer risk.
For example, BRCA2 mutations are also associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer and male breast cancer.
If not, who should be?
Genetic counselors are helpful in determining what type of testing is indicated.
Individuals with a personal or family history of breast cancer appearing before age 50, ovarian cancer at any age, breast cancer in both breasts, male breast cancer, multiple cases of breast cancer within a family, and breast cancer in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry should get genetic counseling to determine whether they should be tested.
While the lifetime risk for breast and ovarian cancers in BRCA carriers are high, the risks increase with age.
Since ovarian cancer screening has not been proven reliably to catch ovarian cancers early, risk-reducing oophorectomy is recommended for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers, ideally between the ages of 35 and 40.
