(CNN) -- A Los Angeles Police officer was caught on an audio recording allegedly making racial slurs during an encounter with some young black men outside a bar in Norco, California.
Apparently, Chief Charlie Beck thinks it is tolerable to have officers on the beat who use the N-word -- as a bar security guard alleged Hillman did -- and refer to young black men as "monkeys," as Hillman can be heard doing on the audio recording.
If black men are more likely to be seen as perpetrators of violence, are cops justified in being more wary of black men?
Should you be tempted to ask yourself "which came first?"
In our communities, police officers are the face of authority.
By allowing the officer who allegedly made these racial slurs to remain on the force -- even after a disciplinary board rules that he should be fired -- LAPD Chief Beck has sent a message to all young black men in Los Angeles that his officers are not to be trusted.
Whatever you say will be put in the police report, and it will be used against you by the prosecutor.
But that doesn't mean anyone should stand by and do nothing.
We can start with demanding action from LAPD Chief Charlie Beck.
