The White House has set a goal of enrolling 7 million people in private insurance plans through the new health insurance exchanges by March 31, 2014, the end of the glitch-plagued open enrollment period that started October 1.
But it has been tight-lipped so far about how many people have actually enrolled in private insurance plans -- those who have both applied and paid the premiums in advance.
Medicaid programs are the public health insurance programs run by states to provide low-income people with health insurance.
But in many of the states operating their own exchanges, new Medicaid enrollees account for more than half of the people who have obtained insurance under Obamacare since October 1.
"In these small handful of states, they're aggressively targeting people they think might be eligible for Medicaid," Salo said.
In Arkansas they've insured more than 62,000 people in Medicaid since October 1.
But in a novel twist they're doing it by using Medicaid dollars to buy people private insurance on the exchanges.
It may very well be that not enough people -- particularly the young and the healthy people who are needed to pay premiums to offset the benefits going out to older and less healthy -- are signing up for health insurance on the exchanges.
But with so little information from the government, it is too early to tell.
