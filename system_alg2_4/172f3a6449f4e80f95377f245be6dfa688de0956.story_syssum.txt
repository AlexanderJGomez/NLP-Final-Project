Glatzer died in Los Angeles on Tuesday after having ALS for four years, his publicist said.
Directing the movie was a challenge that Glatzer embraced, even as he faced a growing number of health obstacles after his ALS diagnosis in 2011.
"Finally, to our filmmakers, Wash Westmoreland and Richard Glatzer, who had hoped to be here tonight, but they can't because of Richard's health," she said.
"When Richard was diagnosed with ALS, Wash asked him what  he wanted to do.
And that's what he did."
