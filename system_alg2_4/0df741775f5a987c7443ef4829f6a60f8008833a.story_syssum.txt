(CNN) -- Former CNN anchor Lou Dobbs said Thursday said neither he nor his companies have ever hired illegal immigrants and it was not his responsibility to check their papers.
But Macdonald said that the situation involved Dobbs and his Dobbs Group hiring contractors that she said used undocumented workers.
"I don't think so," adding he could be sued for stepping in.
That doesn't sit well with me," Dobbs told the author.
Macdonald said Dobbs is responsible for those working at his properties.
In the article, several people identified as current or former workers on Dobbs' properties say they were in the United States illegally at the time.
In particular, he has said that employers who hire illegal immigrants should be prosecuted.
According to the article, the man said an old friend worked at a stable owned by Dobbs and promised the man work as a groom at a Vermont stable contracted to care for horses owned by the Dobbs Group, which is headed by Dobbs.
Another man whom the article says cared for Dobbs Group horses is quoted as saying the job required him to be available at all hours, day and night.
"You put out an article that is being used by the left-wing press as a hammer on me," Dobbs told Macdonald.
"Your listeners deserve to know the truth," said Macdonald.
"Even Lou Dobbs, the emblem of this get-tough approach on immigration enforcement, even he has been unable to manage his property [so that] there will be no undocumented workers," Macdonald said.
