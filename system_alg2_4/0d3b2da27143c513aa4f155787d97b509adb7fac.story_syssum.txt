(CNN) -- California Rep. Maxine Waters is pressing the House ethics panel to set her trial date before the midterm elections in November.
According to a House ethics committee report, Waters helped arrange a meeting in September 2008 between Massachusetts-based OneUnited Bank and Treasury Department officials.
Waters' conduct may have violated" House rules, the report concludes.
...
"All I know is that I have not been charged, that there has been a report that was released that said further investigation," Waters said.
Rangel, the former chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, has been accused of 13 violations of House rules involving alleged financial wrongdoing and harming the credibility of Congress.
It should be fair," Waters said.
Both representatives are leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus, and OneUnited Bank is one of the largest minority-owned banks in America.
