Stephen Colbert's trip to Iraq, facilitated by the USO, was six months in the planning.
The organization, which was founded in 1941 to bring comfort and entertainment to America's men and women in uniform, has been focusing its support on American troops stationed around the world, particularly those in the military theaters of Iraq and Afghanistan, said Phillips.
The Colbert trip was a meeting of the minds between the Comedy Central star and the military, said Rachel Tischler, the USO's vice president for entertainment operations.
He also put in a plug for USO donations: "The USO does more than bring my show to Baghdad," Colbert said on the show.
"They also deliver much-needed care packages to the troops."
"What we try to do is give the soldiers -- the people that are out there putting their lives on the line for our country ... we try to say, one day if you come to Los Angeles, if you want to be a comedian, our door is open to you.
A number of performers return again and again.
Toby Keith has gone on at least seven USO tours; "He insists on going to the smallest, most remote places," said Phillips.
At its core, Phillips said, the USO remains dedicated to the needs of U.S. service members.
"Service members in Iraq and Afghanistan are frequently at small, remote bases," said Phillips.
