Insurance companies are using the referendum process to try to strike down a new law in Washington state.
"Insurance companies have figured out that they can make more money if they don't pay your claim,'' said Washington state Rep. Steve Kirby.
But the very next day a coalition, funded primarily by insurance companies, moved in to stop the law from going into effect by filing petitions for a voter referendum on the law.
"The insurance companies stepped in and said, 'Consumers, you get to decide if you want to do this,' '' said Dana Childers, executive director of the Liability Reform Coalition, which is leading the insurance company charge to defeat the new law.
"If companies act in good faith, [they are] not going to have a problem," Kreidler said.
There's going to be no treble damages, because if companies deal with their customers in good faith there's no penalty."
It's not a new tactic by the insurance companies.
How did they do it?
Washington state resident Michelle Tribble plans to vote for the law because she says she has experienced the strategy first-hand.
Tribble was working for an insurance company when she got rear-ended on the freeway.
An arbitrator sided with Tribble, but Allstate refused to pay.
Allstate said it could not comment on individual claims but said cases like Tribble's prove "that the current judicial system is working."
