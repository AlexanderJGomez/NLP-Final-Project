The lawsuits were filed Thursday in an Atlanta court on behalf of two anonymous women -- listed as Jane Doe and June Doe -- alleging they were sexually assaulted in separate incidents in 2012 and 2014 at the Georgia Tech chapter fraternity house based on a fraternity playbook for targeting women.
Simon's firm said the same fraternity member was involved in both incidents.
The fraternity member who wrote the email apologized in Georgia Tech's student newspaper last year.
The school's chapter was disbanded for three years over accusations of sexual assault in March, Georgia Tech said.
