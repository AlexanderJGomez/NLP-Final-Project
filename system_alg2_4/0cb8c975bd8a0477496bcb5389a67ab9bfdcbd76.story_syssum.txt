Arsenic in apple juice.
The move comes two years after an episode of "The Dr. Oz Show" raised public concern about the amount of arsenic in children's apple juice.
The researchers found about 10% of the samples had arsenic levels higher than 10 parts per billion.
"It's everywhere in the environment and can be found in water, air and soil, in both organic and inorganic forms.
The analysis showed that 95% of the samples tested were below 10 parts per billion for both organic and inorganic arsenic; 100% of the samples were below 10 parts per billion for inorganic arsenic.
Humans have been exposed to it for thousands of years."
The researchers found about 10% of the samples --including ones from well-known brands -- had arsenic levels higher than 10 parts per billion.
The FDA has to accept public comments on their proposal for 60 days before these recommendations can be implemented.
