To help you, Travel + Leisure has assembled the ultimate online guide.
Don't get stuck on the name.
Decide how much you want to spend and when you want to travel, and Getaway Maps will overlay the lowest fares pulled from more than 500 airlines (most of the major U.S. carriers, as well as many international ones) for a select range of cities.
Caveat: Farecast covers only 78 cities, all of them in the United States.
Search hotels by ratings in your city of choice, and the site turns up an impressive mix of reduced rates on rooms at luxury properties.
Caveat: Menus may be a bit stale; 3,000 to 5,000 are updated per month.
Like most airlines these days, the site is no-frills, but you'll never get stuck next to the bathroom again.
Caveat: Not a booking site, so prices usually aren't listed.
Caveat: There are no actual subway maps.
Scan information on 4.4 million miles of road across 42 European countries.
Caveat: Animations and flashing ads create a bit of sensory overload.
Get current conditions for 98,000 destinations worldwide, updated every 20 minutes.
