(CNN) -- Wildlife officials in Colorado say they have killed a bear believed to have been involved in an attack on a teenage boy Friday morning.
Officials had said earlier they would have to kill the bear, pointing to the bold and aggressive behavior it exhibited when it wandered into the site with so many campers.
The bear was then chased away by the teen and other campers at the site.
He is expected to recover but will receive followup treatment.
The bear kept getting more and more aggressive and I didn't think I would have lived if he didn't run," Voss told the affiliate.
Earlier this month, a man was killed in a grizzly bear attack in Wyoming's Yellowstone Park.
