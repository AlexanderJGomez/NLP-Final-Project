New York (CNN) -- A coalition of at least 40 religious and civic organizations Wednesday announced the creation of an alliance to show support for the Islamic community center and mosque proposed to be built near New York's ground zero.
"All those people who died that day ...  they were murdered for being Americans.
"I've had families who have told us their PTSD has come back because of the idea of a mosque being built over where their loved ones died," she told CNN this week.
"I would have told him, if he had come to us, that it would hurt people," she said.
"We were establishing the center in a neighborhood we were already in," she said.

At an Iftar dinner marking the breaking of the Ramadan fast Tuesday evening, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg forcefully affirmed his support for the project.
It will be built on property the center already owns, two blocks from where the World Trade Center was destroyed by Islamic extremists on September 11, 2001.
