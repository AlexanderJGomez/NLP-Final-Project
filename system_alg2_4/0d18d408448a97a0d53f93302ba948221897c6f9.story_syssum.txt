ETA, which is fighting for the independence of Spain's northern Basque region, was said to be behind three bombs that detonated on the island of Mallorca on Sunday without hurting anyone.
ETA, blamed for more than 800 deaths and listed as a terrorist group by Spain the European Union and the United States, began campaigning for Basque independence in 1959.
On September 16, 1998, the organization declared a "unilateral and indefinite" cease-fire, raising hopes that its campaign was at an end.
It was called off by ETA in June 2006 following numerous more ETA attacks.
Spain officially recognizes three Basque provinces, Alava, Guipuzcoa and Vizcaya.
The Basque people are the oldest indigenous ethnic group in Europe and have lived uninterrupted in the same region since the beginning of recorded history.
ETA and its demands for an independent Basque state arose in 1959 in the midst of this suppression.
For many years France provided a safe haven for ETA members, a situation that began to change in the mid-1980s.
The Good Friday peace accord influenced ETA to call its cease-fire in 1998.
