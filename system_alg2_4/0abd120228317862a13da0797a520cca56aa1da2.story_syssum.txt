A Middlesex County Superior Court judge sentenced Mark Kerrigan to 2.5 years after a jury convicted him Wednesday of assault and battery.
The judge sentenced Mark Kerrigan to serve two years in prison, followed by two years of probation, during which he will have to satisfy several conditions, including mental health and alcohol abuse treatment, according to O'Brien.
"My family has never believed at all that my brother had anything to do with my father's death," Nancy Kerrigan said outside the courthouse.
Kerrigan's family has said Daniel Kerrigan had a heart condition.
