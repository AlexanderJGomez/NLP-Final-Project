After helping the Brooklyn Nets to relocate from New Jersey to his hometown borough this season, Jay-Z announced Friday that he will be selling his stake in the pro basketball team.
My job as an owner is over but as a fan it has just begun.
My sincerest thanks goes to Bruce Ratner, who first introduced the idea of moving the Nets to Brooklyn.
For Roc Nation Sports to function at its full potential, NBA rules stipulate that I relinquish my ownership in the Brooklyn Nets.
I will always be a Brooklyn Net."
