He is not gone," Vanessa Fontaine said Friday at a press conference outside of the school in Long Island City where her son ran away October 4.
Fontaine wants police to try new tactics in their search.
"I don't know what the commissioner was thinking of last night by saying that, but my son, he is alive, he is out there ...it's just that we are not looking in the right places," Fontaine told reporters.
The New York Police Department has focused its search on rail yards, train stations, tracks and tunnels.
"My message to my son is that I love him, and we're going to find him," she said.
A reward of $77,500 has been offered for his safe return.
