Maroney hurt her left leg after suffering a fall during a stop on Kellogg's Tour of Gymnastics Champions in September, and she's been recovering slowly but surely, she recently told CNN.
I've always been drawn to it and I've always wanted to pursue it, just like gymnastics," she said.
But "after it's all said and done with the Olympics and Worlds and whatever I get the chance to do, I think that would be my time to really get into acting, something that I want to have as my job when I'm older," she said.
"I'm kind of more into movies, because I'm really into getting into [character] and being that person and selling it as well as she always does."
"It was my first time ever doing anything like that," Maroney said.
"Gymnastics, you're in the gym eight hours a day and acting, that's a full-time job as well.
"Zoe has this guy that she's going on a date with, and Rose really likes this guy, and there's a little bit of drama and I'm kind of backing up Rose," Maroney explained.
I really like the character Rose on the show ... and I thought if I was ever going to be on the show, I'd really want to play her, and then I ended up being her best friend.
Even when things get hard, I just believe that everything happens for a reason," she said.
"I'm really an athletic person and I don't think I could let go entirely of the sport.
I really want to try to go to this next Olympics, [and] after I heal up I'll be back in the gym working as hard as I possibly could just like I did for this Olympics.
