Google+, which launched by invitation only in June, has been a hit among so-called "tech elite" journalists, bloggers and others heavily immersed in the technology and social-networking world.
"Google+ is a knee-jerk reaction, a study in short-term thinking, predicated on the incorrect notion that Facebook is successful because they built a great product," Yegge wrote in what was supposed to be an internal memo.
Facebook is successful because they built an entire constellation of products by allowing other people to do the work.
"Some people spend all their time on Mafia Wars," he wrote.
The memo comes on the heels of a report from Chitika Insights, a Web analytics firm, saying traffic on Google+ has plummeted 60% since it opened to the public on September 20.
"It would appear that although high levels of publicity were able to draw new traffic to Google+, few of them saw reason to stay," Chitika said in its report, released Friday.
Mashable's Ben Parr noted in an October 4 post that the low level of public usage by Google's top brass (he counted a total of 22 posts from co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin) sends the wrong message.
