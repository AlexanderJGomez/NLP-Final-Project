San Diego, California (CNN) -- Nearly six years ago, I left Texas to move back home to California.
That will be second only to California, which has 55 electoral votes.
The other winners in the census lottery include Florida, which picked up two new seats in Congress.
It makes for quite a sea change.
You go to Austin, Houston or San Antonio.
Texas is the second-largest state in area, behind Alaska.
But in terms of population growth, it's second to none.
Texas is still a red state, but there is some evidence that it's trending purple.
First, much of it is coming from transplants from blue states such as California.
Second, much of the rest of Texas' population growth is tied to the phenomenal increase in the Hispanic population.
That's not surprising.
There is no question that, as a result of the population shifts of the past 10 years, Texas and states out West are coming into their own and will have more power and influence to steer a new course for the country.
