(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy's grip on the world number one spot in golf loosened Friday after a disastrous seven-over-par 79 at the European Tour's PGA Championship at Wentworth saw the Northern Irishman miss the cut.
For the 23-year-old, who also missed the cut at the Players Championship on the PGA Tour, it is hardly ideal preparation for his defense of the U.S. Open title next month.
Maybe it's a good thing I have two days off to practice and I'm looking to getting back to the States next week," he told gathered reporters.
"Playing golf is better than standing in the field all day," he jokingly told reporters.
World No.3 Lee Westwood was among a number of star players to struggle in blustery afternoon conditions and was right on the cut line at one-over 145.
