From bragging "mommyjackers" and smug "sanctimommies" to pictures of poop-smeared kids and placenta art, blogger Blair Koenig has seen it all.
I began thinking this was something others might be experiencing when a friend (and mom of two) sent me a few screen shots of her old college friends talking about their "perfect" children in their status updates.
But a couple of years ago, I started getting a lot of submissions from parents, many of whom have parent friends that they find annoying.
More often than not, the person does know the "offending" parent and has been pushed to the edge.
Koenig: The aforementioned poop pictures are probably the most common type of submission I receive.
Koenig: I get e-mails from parents who say they're "reformed" and submit old examples of their oversharing ways.
If you're just posting a cute picture of your kid eating ice cream, it won't get featured on STFU, Parents.
The mom blogger community has unleashed some fury against me and the site, but even in those cases, I think it was just one segment of that community.
Koenig: Social media is the gateway drug to oversharing.
Koenig: That answer depends on the person, because some people don't find poop disgusting but are completely repulsed by vomit or long strands of green snot.
It's all pretty gross.
It's like a funny field guide to parent overshare, and I think it'll be an essential baby shower gift.
Koenig: There are two kinds of people on social media: those who post too much information and those who don't.
I've been collecting pet examples for over three years, and I can report that "pet parents" can be just as bad as human parents.
Some people even take pictures of their pet's poop.
