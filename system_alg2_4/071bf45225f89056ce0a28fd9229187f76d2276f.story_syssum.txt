He said the problems were arising as airlines set aside more desirable window and aisle seats for passengers who pay a premium, leaving those who do not pay with center-row seats, separated from other members of their party unless they have paid the surcharge.
The charges for window or aisle seats in the front half of the plane, costing as much as $29 each way on U.S. domestic flights and $59 on international flights, are the latest of a raft of passenger fees introduced in recent years as the airline industry looks to generate new streams of revenue.
"Offering preferred seats for sale to all Delta passengers means that we are offering different seat selection options to enable more passengers to travel in their seat of choice," she said.
Two U.S. airlines, Spirit and Allegiant, also charge passengers for carry-on baggage.
While gate staff would typically try to seat families together, removing aisle and window seats as options was making this impossible, said Hanni.
"If passengers were willing to pay higher fares at the beginning," he said, the problems could be avoided.
Hulme said that the number of rows in which window and aisle seats were set aside as "preferred seating" varied from aircraft to aircraft, but did not extend through the entire plane.
