Part of its territory is in Eastern Europe and the greater part was given to us."
After all, if a revolution can unseat an unpopular, corrupt government in Kiev, why not in Moscow?
And Crimea is the key to Ukraine.
Moscow and Kiev worked out a deal to divide the Soviet Black Sea Fleet between Russia and Ukraine.
Some 60% of Crimea's population is Russian and appears to support the current Russian occupation.
If the current conflict does not spread to other parts of eastern Ukraine -- where there is a sizable population that is demanding closer ties to Russia -- then Crimea could join the ranks of other "frozen conflicts" in the post-Soviet space.
Occupying Crimea and raising tensions in eastern Ukraine to prevent Ukraine from moving toward more Western influence is a top priority for the Kremlin.
Given Russia's determination not to back down from Crimea, the United States and its allies will have to focus on containing the advance of Russian troops beyond Crimea and trying to ensure that an unanticipated local conflict between groups under the control neither of Moscow nor Kiev could not precipitate a broader armed struggle in Ukraine.
Because if there were an armed conflict, neither the United States nor NATO would get militarily involved, and the result could be the dismemberment of Ukraine and its division into two states on either side of a new East-West divide.
