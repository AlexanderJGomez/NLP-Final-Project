Los Angeles (CNN) -- Zsa Zsa Gabor's Bel Air mansion, which offers an expansive -- and expensive -- view of Los Angeles, officially hits the real estate market for sale Tuesday, according to the realtor who is listing the property.
Music producer Quincy Jones lives next door.
She has been unable to walk since a 2002 car accident.
He would like to move with his wife into a condo along Wilshire Boulevard in West Los Angeles, closer to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where Gabor has spent much of her time in the past year, he said.
Hilton, who has not been allowed by von Anhalt to see her mother in several months, said Gabor would never want to leave her house for a condo.
