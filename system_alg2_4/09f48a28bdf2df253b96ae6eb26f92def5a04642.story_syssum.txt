Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Taliban militants beheaded two children in southern Afghanistan, a provincial governor's office said.
There were no immediate details about the 16-year-old.
The Taliban said the attack was intended to target Americans in Kabul International Airport, one part of which is used by military forces and another by civilians, the officials said.
In eastern Afghanistan, a service member with NATO's International Security Assistance Force died in a bombing on Monday, the latest in a string of coalition deaths.
