Los Angeles (CNN) -- The remaining plaintiff in the sexual battery lawsuit against John Travolta fired his lawyer, but the case could continue with another lawyer and another court, two lawyers told CNN on Thursday.
John Doe #1, who said that Travolta sexually harassed him at the Beverly Hills Hotel, hired Allred on Tuesday, just hours after he withdrew from Okorocha's lawsuit.
Allred said Tuesday that she and John Doe #1 would discuss if a new lawsuit would be filed against Travolta.
Okorocha told CNN the date should have been January 15, but the mistake would have hampered the chances of John Doe #2 in court.
Despite losing both clients, Okorocha told CNN Thursday that he still believes they "absolutely have cases" against the actor.
"Clients come to me," Allred said.
Okorocha, reached by Wednesday afternoon, said he had a text message exchange on Tuesday with his client saying he was called by Allred.
"If Travolta doesn't take responsibility, I'm going to file those cases," he said.
