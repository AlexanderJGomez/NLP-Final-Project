Then earlier this year there was the remix to Rihanna's song "Birthday Cake," in which Brown was the featured guest vocalist offering such coy nuggets as:
In any case, the couple's allusions to their reunion --a Twitter picture showed her embracing a man who appears to be Brown; another showed a man presumed to be Brown face down and shirtless on a bed -- culminated with Brown posting a photo of himself and Rihanna, who appears to be in her underwear.
Normally I don't like to get too involved in grown folks' private business.
When the world first saw the images of Rihanna's face after her fight with Brown, many rushed to blanket the songstress with support.
The way she is flaunting their relationship now, I don't anticipate the same amount of sympathy for her if another incident occurs.
She's right.
After that recording, I thought Rihanna had gotten Brown out of her system.
Since completing a 52-week domestic violence program, Brown has shown about as much control over his temper as Bruce Banner.
Oh, I can hear Brown fans now -- leave him alone.
Stop hating.
And if there's a repeat of 2009, a lot of us won't be interested enough to care.
