(CNN) -- The winner of the 82nd annual Scripps National Spelling Bee said Friday she is "pretty excited" but a little tired.
In an event that has seen contestants crack under the strain of the national spotlight, Kavya -- competing in her fourth national finals -- appeared composed throughout.
Kavya's father, who is her spelling coach, would tap his foot in time as she spelled the words, and at one point he appeared so confident that he waved to someone while his daughter was in the middle of spelling a word.
Kavya said she would miss competing in the spelling bee, as the rules do not permit her to enter next year.
"If my [little] sister gets to D.C. sometime soon, I'd really love to help and coach her," she said.
