DC Comics pulled the cover for the upcoming "Batgirl" #41, which portrays the Joker threatening a frightened Batgirl with a gun, with "Joker makeup" on her mouth.
The cover recalls Barbara "Batgirl" Gordon's encounter with the Joker in the classic story "The Killing Joke."
DC Comics (owned by Time Warner, which also owns CNN) said in a statement late Monday that artist Rafael Albuquerque's cover was going to be pulled.
'The Killing Joke' is part of Batgirl's canon and artistically, I couldn't avoid portraying the traumatic relationship between Barbara Gordon and the Joker."
For that reason, I have recommended to DC that the variant cover be pulled.
There's no 'censorship' here."
1 variant cover caused an uproar for being "over-sexualized."
(The company later said there was no connection between the two events.)
