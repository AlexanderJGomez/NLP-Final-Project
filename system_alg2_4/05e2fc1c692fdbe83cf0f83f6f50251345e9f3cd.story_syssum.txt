Boy?
The man on the phone was offering us young children with the casualness of a market trader.
It had all been heartbreakingly simple.
When our colleague want to see them, he was shown a group of children and asked which one he wanted to take.
I told him we wanted to know what we'd need to do, if we decided we did want to "foster" the children.
He told me, "Sister, Jesus will reward me," so the "fostering" was free, he said.
The Global Slavery Index says Nigeria has the highest number of people in modern slavery of any sub-Saharan country.
Did I want to consider an older girl?
She could look after the 3-year-old, and cook and clean.
He then proceeded to do just that, laughing down the phone at my first tentative guess of $200.
I put the phone down and we traveled back to the capital that day to show Naptip what we'd found.
