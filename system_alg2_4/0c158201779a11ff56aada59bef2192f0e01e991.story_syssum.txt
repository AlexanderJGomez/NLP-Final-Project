(CNN) -- As a child, Ranjan Avasthi was once bitten by the family's German shepherd.
He also knows that kids will be kids.
"Kids naturally do things that upset cats and dogs — hugging, staring, petting on the head," says animal behaviorist Kristen Collins of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA.org).
We all know that kids and pets can peacefully coexist.
Avasthi says.
Reinforce healthy interaction: Help kids understand how to safely approach a cat or dog.
She also recommends that kids and parents practice the proper way to pet a cat or dog using stuffed animals.
"We sit with kids and talk about things dogs don't like and cats don't like," Collins says.
The goal is to help kids overcome a fearful response when they think about the pet.
"Then the child is not afraid and doesn't learn the wrong behaviors," Avasthi says.
Encourage a healthy respect for Mother Nature: "Educate kids that our house pets — even though domesticated and pets — they are animals," Avasthi says.
