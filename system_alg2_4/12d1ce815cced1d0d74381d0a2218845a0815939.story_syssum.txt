(CNN)Five young men were arrested Saturday in Melbourne, Australia, in what police called a major counterterrorism operation.
"Some evidence that we have collected at a couple of the scenes and some other information we have leads us to believe that this particular matter was ISIS-inspired," said Neil Gaughan, acting deputy commissioner of the Australian Federal Police.
Police said the suspects were targeting a ceremony on Anzac Day (Australia and New Zealand Army Corps Day), which is April 25 and this year is the centennial of the Gallipoli Campaign in World War I.
"I think the entire Australian community should be concerned about the young age of those particular men," Gaughan said.
The suspects were associates of 18-year-old Nadun Haider, who was killed while stabbing officers at a police station in September, police said.
In February, two men were charged with plotting terror activities in Sydney.
Australians should be stoic about the threat of terrorism, Abbott said Saturday.
Police said this particular threat had been fully contained.
