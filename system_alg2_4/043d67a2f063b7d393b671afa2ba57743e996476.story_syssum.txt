The eyewitness -- a man we will call Abu Ibrahim -- does more than watch.
His photographs document the story of a body staged to look like a crucifixion -- and to send a message -- in the northern Syrian city of Raqqa.
The jihadist group carried out a total of seven public executions in Raqqa on Tuesday, but only two bodies were displayed afterward, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group.
"It has become a standard feature of fringe Islamist groups to revive these outdated practices in an effort to bring back what they believe is authentic."
All three men in Raqqa were shot in the head prior to being affixed to crosses.
"All shop owners must close their stores immediately upon the announcement of prayer and go to the mosque," a decree posted this week reportedly reads.
After nearly a year under the repression of ISIS, Abu Ibrahim and about 20 other activists formed a campaign in April that they called "Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently" to push the vigilante group out of their hometown.
On their Facebook page with nearly 12,000 followers, activists post updates on alleged crimes committed against the people of Raqqa and issue calls to action such as proposing a strike by store owners on Saturday to protest an ISIS tax hike.
"Life here is very hard.
It's that easy for ISIS," Abu Ibrahim says.
The worst part is people are too afraid to ask about their husbands or sons," Abu Ibrahim says.
There are more and more executions and now the children watch like they are used to it.
"The word is often more powerful than the bullet, and the will of the people is the most powerful of all," Abu Ibrahim says.
