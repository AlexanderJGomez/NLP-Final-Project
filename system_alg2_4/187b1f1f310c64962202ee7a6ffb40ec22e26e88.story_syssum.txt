Members of the Writers Guild of America manned picket lines Monday morning outside NBC studios at Rockefeller Plaza, carrying signs and yelling, on the first day of the Writers Guild of America's strike against studios and production companies.
"I support them," Leno said of the writers.
A last-day effort to reach a new work agreement collapsed Sunday night despite the writers conceding a demand for a doubling of how much they are paid for DVD sales.
While studios have been hoarding scripts for months in anticipation of a strike, some television shows that are more topical -- particularly late-night TV talk shows -- are expected to immediately go to reruns.
"It's affecting us in the most visible way possible," John Oliver, a writer and correspondent for "The Daily Show," told CNN on Monday as he stood amid the pickets, who carried signs that read "On Strike" and "Pencils Down."
However, he said, the writers need new contracts that incorporate new media's impact.
The WGA said producers want to deny the union future jurisdiction over scripts written for most new media and have offered no economic proposal for the parts of new media writing the guild wants covered.
"We made an attempt at meeting them in a number of their key areas, including Internet streaming and jurisdiction in new media," Counter said.
And, as video iPods and Internet downloads increasingly supplant traditional television and movie theaters, writers confront a changing industry.
A spokeswoman for the guild, Sherry Goldman, told CNN on Monday that the strike would not affect news divisions.
But networks would have to resort to reruns, news programs and reality shows to fill the schedule in 2008 if a strike were to drag on.
