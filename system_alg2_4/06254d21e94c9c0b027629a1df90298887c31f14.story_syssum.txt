More than 4.2 million Iraqis have fled their homes, around 2 million to neighboring states, mostly Syria and Jordan, and another 2.2 million displaced inside Iraq.
Jolie has been working to help draw attention to the problem and has called for governments to bolster their support of the U.N.H.C.R.
In August, Jolie first visited Iraq and Syria to get a sense of the problem.
Jolie said it was crucial that the government prepare a plan to deal with refugees who return home from Syria and Jordan and find that their homes are "occupied" by others or "bombed out."
Jolie also is talking to people about moving forward the U.S. effort to resettle Iraqi refugees in the United States, which has set a goal of taking in 12,000 of those people by September.

Last month, the UNHCR announced a plan to seek $261 million this year for its work to help these refugees.
