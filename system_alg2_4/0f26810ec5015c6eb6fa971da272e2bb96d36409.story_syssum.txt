The National Court previously has taken on other high-profile human rights cases outside of Spain, such as charges against former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and more recently against former military leaders of El Salvador.
Some of their relatives brought the suit to the court last August.

The court said it will notify Israel to request that those named in the complaint be formally notified, so that they could called by the Spanish court to testify.
