No one knows what was said amongst Solange Knowles, Jay Z and Beyonce in that elevator in the Standard Hotel in Manhattan or even what led up to the video that appears to show Solange kicking and hitting her brother-in-law.
Quoting an anonymous source, Us Weekly reported that Solange Knowles had an earlier run-in with designer Rachel Roy.
This, according to the Daily News, did not sit well with Beyonce's younger sister.
So far, some of the principal characters seem to be letting Instagram speak for them.
I am actually impressed with her independent spirit... She seems like a fighter #festivallife."
