(CNN) -- Navigating the political waters in her own family, says one ally, likely prepared Kathleen Sebelius well for the partisan cauldron she's now enduring in Washington over the rocky rollout of the Obamacare website.

One of her responses: "I think my job is to get this fully implemented and to get the website working right.
A Catholic, she drew the wrath of the Church when, as Governor of Kansas, she vetoed a restrictive anti-abortion bill.
"There was a significant rise in regulations placed on healthcare, which drove the cost of providing healthcare in Kansas up," said Todd Tiahrt, a former Republican Congressman from Kansas.
But Pollack defends Sebelius on that score.
Born in Cincinnati, Sebelius was the daughter of the late John 'Jack' Gilligan, who served as Ohio's Governor from 1971-1975.
Sebelius's father-in-law, Keith Sebelius, was a conservative Republican congressman from Kansas from 1969-1981.
One of Keith Sebelius's top aides was current Republican Sen. Pat Roberts, who considers himself a longtime friend of the Sebelius family.
She says Roberts was a longtime opponent of Obamacare, but the "last straw" for him was when Sebelius went on a public speaking tour just as the rollout calamity began.
