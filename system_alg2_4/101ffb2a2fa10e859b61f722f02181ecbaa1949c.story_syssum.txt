Dandong, China (CNN) -- The sun is rising over the Yalu River and North Korea.
Tourists often do just that when they go right up to the fence that separates the two countries and leave cigarettes, old watches and other goodies for the North Korean border guards.
Chinese tourists now flock to Dandong -- which lies along China's western border with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea -- to ogle at their unfortunate neighbors.
"Go inside North Korea!"
China is North Korea's largest trading partner by a long way, and despite Beijing's official displeasure with the DPRK's pursuit of nuclear weapons, this trade continues to grow.
We meet "Chen," a smuggler who makes a midnight run across the Yalu several times a month to trade with North Korean soldiers.
But Chen says he can never trade with ordinary North Koreans, the soldiers wouldn't allow it.
And you can find them all across Dandong in North Korean themed restaurants, karaoke bars, and musical review shows.
And as the four-piece all-female North Korean band plays to the Chinese tourists drinking North Korean beer, I think how perfectly it sums up this city: extremely bizarre and perhaps a little tragic.
