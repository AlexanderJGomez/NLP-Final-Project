For just two eerie minutes in the early hours of the morning local time, the country - known for its blistering sunshine - was plunged into a chilly darkness.
iReporters were on hand to capture this extraordinary astronomical moment for CNN, sending in images from across the region -- from Australia, New Zealand and even from a cruise ship hundreds of miles off the Australian coast.
Maj Coop from Brisbane, Australia, sent in an unusual image of the eclipse -- as seen through an X-ray of her mother's hand.
"I thought it would be cool to take a few photos because I haven't seen an eclipse in my lifetime," he said.
Dave Thompson sent in his image of the eclipse in Pormpuraaw, rural northern Queensland, Australia, via Instagram.
