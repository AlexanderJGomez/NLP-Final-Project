(CNN) -- Delta Air Lines is reviewing surveillance video from an incident last week in which a 9-year-old boy boarded a flight from Minneapolis to Las Vegas, apparently alone and without a ticket, a spokeswoman for the airline said Monday.
The boy went through security with other passengers, the Transportation Security Administration said in a statement Sunday, but officials are still trying to figure out how he did it -- and how he then got on the flight Thursday.
The boy spent a good amount of time at the airport before boarding the plane, KARE reported.
He was there the day before, the station reported, citing airport officials.
A flight security expert said the incident highlights the gaps in security, especially when it comes to children.
Last year an 11-year-old boy in Manchester, England, managed to slip away from his mother during a shopping trip.
He made it all the way to Rome without a boarding pass or a passport.
