We've compiled a list of 10 of the best.

Bruce Lee's last movie before his untimely death, this is him at his very best.

It spawned a spate of copycat films, while thousands of children signed up to after-school karate; everyone now knows how to defend themselves by waxing on or off and that the best fighting move is obviously The Crane.

Once described as "the best kung fu football film of all time," this is one of the more ridiculous films of the genre.

Jean-Claude Van Damme has made some good films, really he has.
The franchise came out of part two with a little credibility intact, but this last installment -- unless you include "The Next Karate Kid" (which no self-respecting "Karate Kid" fan would) -- managed to kill off our last shred of enthusiasm.
The first "Under Siege" was a surprisingly good film, and Hollywood's best martial arts expert acquits himself well, but this follow up is laughable.
Through no fault of his own, this is Bruce Lee's posthumous contribution to the list.
This tacky movie features fight scenes shot before Lee died, interspersed with material filmed using lookalikes and a cardboard cutout of the great man.
