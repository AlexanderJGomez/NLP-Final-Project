(CNN) -- Apple appears to be testing out motion control features that will let people control their iPhones by moving their heads.
The left or right head movements can be assigned to different tasks, including returning to the main home screen, displaying notifications or activating voice assistant Siri.
The head-movement feature is meant as an accessibility option, but it's easy to imagine similar motion control features becoming more commonplace on devices in the future.
The Microsoft Kinect and a soon-to-be-released device from Leap Motion use powerful depth sensor cameras.
If you look away from a video while it is playing, it can automatically pause.
