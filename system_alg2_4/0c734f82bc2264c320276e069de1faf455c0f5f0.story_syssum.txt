But "Mad Men" misrepresents the advertising industry of my time by ignoring the dynamics of the Creative Revolution that changed the world of communications forever.
And with two copywriters as partners, started what was unthinkable at the time, the first ad agency to have the name of an art director in its masthead, and later, the first to go public.
It was a testy time to be a graphic designer like me who had the rage to communicate and, to create icon rather than con.
Of course the producers of "Mad Men" are making TV drama and not documentary.
