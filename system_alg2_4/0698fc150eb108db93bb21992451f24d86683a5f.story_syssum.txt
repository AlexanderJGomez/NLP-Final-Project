Jett Webb killed the massive animal last month in eastern North Carolina.
It's not every day you see something that size," Webb said.
"They can't believe something that big is running around the woods of eastern North Carolina."
"The meat the pig provided and the memory that hunting provides is worth more than any trophy," he said.
Webb said he used an AR-10 with a .308-caliber round.
It topped out, but Webb said he didn't think the boar weighed much more than 500 pounds.
In North Carolina, wild boar may be hunted year round during normal hunting hours.
In 2004, a hunter in Georgia killed an 800-pound boar dubbed Hogzilla.
