A group of UK transport and technology experts has come together to create a new digital platform that would map the emotions of people using different types of public transport in real time in the hope of improving daily journeys.
Ultimately, developers say, the aim is to use a number of sources, including weather data or information about events, to help bus and rail customers plan their journeys better and save their money and time -- and frayed nerves too.
While the project is still in its infancy, the team unveiled Thursday morning a live tool mapping passengers' sentiment based on Twitter.
Based in Milton Keynes, the Transport Systems Catapult's space will bring together innovators, research and entrepreneurs to trial and develop smart mobility solutions ranging from sentiment mapping and driverless vehicles, intelligent traffic lights and improved airport data systems
"The way you get from A to B often involves loads of different methods of transport -- you might walk, take the bus, train, bicycle; how do you make all those different modes of transport more connected, how do we use emerging technologies like GPS, satellite technology, mobile phones, open data or sentiment mapping and how do we use these technologies to improve transport systems."
