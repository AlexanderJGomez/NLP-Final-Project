The family of Cameron Todd Willingham has asked a judge to posthumously clear his name, arguing that he was put to death based on "junk science."
He burnt them," she said.
Kuykendall spoke before an Austin judge opened a hearing into the Willingham's family's request for an inquiry into the execution.
Lowell Thompson, the district attorney for Navarro County, which includes Corsicana, did not return a phone call seeking comment Wednesday.
In asking Baird to open a "court of inquiry" into the execution, Willingham's family argues that he was put to death for a crime "that modern science reveals may never have been committed."
"Despite overwhelming scientific evidence, state officials have continued to demonize Mr. Willingham and defend the arson evidence on which he and others have been convicted," the family's petition states.
A spokeswoman for the governor's office told CNN on Tuesday that Perry, who allowed the execution to go forward, remains convinced of Willingham's guilt.
