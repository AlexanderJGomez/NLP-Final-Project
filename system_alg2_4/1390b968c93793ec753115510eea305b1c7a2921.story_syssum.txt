(CNN)  -- Actor Wendell Pierce's biggest role today is running the Pontchartrain Park Community Development Corp., which is hard at work trying to rebuild the New Orleans neighborhood devastated by Hurricane Katrina.
WENDELL PIERCE: Pontchartrain Park started in 1952 as a result of the civil rights movement.
...
In the middle of it was this wonderful golf course created by Joseph Bartholomew, who did most of the golf courses in New Orleans but couldn't play on any of them.
I put out a call to action to people in my generation.
PIERCE: It's going great.
We have 200 people in line to purchase homes, and that's before any marketing.
The money to assist people comes through the state.
That's because the state is hostile to the city and is trying to reappropriate the money to other parts of the state and not to the city of New Orleans.
PIERCE: Right now in New Orleans, it's worse than the week of the storm.
Because it's a concerted effort to reappropriate the money and keep the poor and black people out.
The only large-scale thing they did was to destroy public housing and get rid of a large population of minority people and the poor.
We plan to do 550 [homes in the Park]; compare that with the fact there are 30,000 to 50,000 blighted properties here.
PIERCE: We have everyone imaginable; we have elderly, we have young couples trying to get in, we have 80-year-olds trying to get back into their properties.
CNN: The government's not rebuilding New Orleans.
This is happening all over the city.
What surprised me the most [when I began this] was the lack of skill and competence on the government's part to know how to put this together, and how strong the effort to stop people from moving back to New Orleans is.
Our goal is 7,000 in the city, about 550 in the Park.
PIERCE: Yes, I do play the trombone, but I play very poorly, so they turn my mic off, and my sound double plays.
But I learned every song, and I'm getting better!
