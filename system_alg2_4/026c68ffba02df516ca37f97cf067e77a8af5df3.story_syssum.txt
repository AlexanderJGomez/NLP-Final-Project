As darkness enveloped Medinah Country Club in Chicago, Europe's captain Olazabal talked of how the spirit of Seve Ballesteros had been key to his team's success.
"The thing that Europe had -- distinct to the United States -- was the notion of playing for Seve, and teams are often at their best when playing for an idea," says Tu, whose book 'Superteams' will be published next month.
"I'm not sure the U.S. did a lot wrong.
The 46-year-old may have lacked the organizational ability of previous European captain Colin Montgomerie, whose side triumphed in another nail biting clash in Wales two years ago, but he compensated in other areas, says Tu.
"Montgomerie was about thorough preparation and leaving no detail unturned in an attempt to ensure the players were given the best platform to produce victory.
Despite that glitch, Tu believes Olazabal built a team where belief became an intrinsic value and where his man management skills produced inspired results.
"Teams play for a leader," says Tu.
"This would have liberated Kaymer -- and just look at the way both he and Stricker handled the pressure in their clash late on.
Stricker's misery was compounded by the fact he was the only player among the two dozen involved who failed to win a point all week -- a statistic that history will not look kindly upon as Americans try to understand how they snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.
"If it were just this U.S. team that lost when on paper it seemed to have the better players, the blame might be easier to assign.
