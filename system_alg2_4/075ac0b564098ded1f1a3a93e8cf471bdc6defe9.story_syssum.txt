London (CNN) -- After three marathons, I really should know what to do by now.
Ideally a marathon runner should be doing 40 to 50 miles a week for at least three or four months before race day.
It can leave you feeling nauseous -- again, training helps to condition the body to running long distances.
The only real distances under my belt are the three miles that I walk each day from Victoria Station in London up to CNN's bureau in Soho.
But three demanding children and a house restoration project mean the only time I've had to run is late at night.
Last night I ran 17 miles and felt shattered.
After worrying that I hadn't done nearly enough training for Sunday's Brighton marathon, I finished in a creditable three hours and 35 minutes -- only a couple of minutes slower than last year's time.
It only really became an ordeal for the last two or three miles, when my legs and feet felt like concrete and my chest started to tighten.
I felt pretty rough straight after the race, but better than last year when I was sick after I crossed the line.
On Monday I went to work in London and my legs were more stiff but not painful, but I managed to walk three miles.
It certainly saved me a lot of time -- I always find the worst thing about preparing for a marathon is the monotony of running mile after boring mile for months beforehand
So I would implore anyone considering a marathon to get out and give it a go: it's really not as hard as you might think.
