To veto or not to veto: It's up to Arizona Gov.
Earlier, Brewer told CNN that her decision will come after she returns this week to Arizona from Washington, where she has been attending National Governors Association meetings.
The bill was sent to Brewer on Monday and she has five days to sign it, veto it, or do nothing and it would become law.
Just over a year into her tenure, Brewer rose to national prominence after signing SB1070 into law, a strict immigration measure also known as the "show me your papers" law that allows law enforcement to ask people for legal documents, which critics say leads to racial profiling of Latinos.
Under her, Arizona became one of three states to allow people to carry concealed weapons without a permit.
While social and religious conservatives hope her conservative principles continue to guide her action regarding the LGBT measure, her record on lesbian and gay issues is thin.
Brewer said the state couldn't afford it, and she defended her decision in court.
Some influential business groups in Arizona oppose SB1062, the "religious freedom bill."
And Brewer is well liked in the business community.
"We believe she's done more than any governor nationwide to improve the economic competitiveness in her state," said Garrick Taylor, a spokesman for the Arizona Chamber.
Brewer is also facing growing support for a veto.
While the measure is not about same-sex marriage, a likely indicator of where Arizonans stand on the SB1062 is a Behavior Research Center's Rocky Mountain Poll from last year.
A spokesman for the NFL, which will host Super Bowl XLIX, in Glendale next February, said the league is watching developments in Arizona.
