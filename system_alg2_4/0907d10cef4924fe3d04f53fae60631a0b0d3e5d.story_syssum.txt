(CNN) -- A Sikh farmer in India has surpassed a month on a hunger strike, demanding the release of six men from his community jailed since the 1990s during a period of a deadly Sikh separatist movement in the country.
Those who support Khalsa's hunger strike say it is long overdue that the cases of those Sikhs be reviewed.
Phoolka said.
"It is not unusual to set lifers free after they have served 14 years in prison," Phoolka said.
Khalsa is "weak but says he will not end (his hunger strike) until he sees those six prisoners free," his aide said.
In India, state authorities can review a lifer's case after a prisoner serving that sentence has spent 14 years, Bains and lawyer Phoolka said.
"There are numerous examples where life convicts have been prematurely released after undergoing imprisonment of 12 to 14 years or even less," Phoolka said.
"There were serious human rights abuses during the Punjab insurgency," the human rights group said.
"Despite the findings of independent commissions, government forces or officials responsible for excesses, including during the 1984 riots, are yet to be properly prosecuted," Human Rights Watch said in its statement.
So, I am not standing on any false prestige.
