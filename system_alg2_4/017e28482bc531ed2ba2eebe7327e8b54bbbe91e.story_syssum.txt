(CNN) -- Last year we published a list of quintessential Americana experiences.
Apparently, plenty.
1.
The first boardwalk was built in Atlantic City in 1870, when a railroad conductor was asked to find a way to prevent sand from filling shorefront hotel entryways.
2.
One of the most inspiring American experiences is witnessing the culture of the first Americans come alive in a spectacle of swirling, pulsing color.
3.
Wrigley Field in Chicago, regardless of denomination, is their Vatican.
There's truly no better place to watch a game if you want a direct link to nearly a century of baseball history.
4.
While it doesn't get much more American than the Super Bowl, we'd argue that the most enjoyable, purest way to experience the unique American-branded mixture of militant strategics, refined athleticism, brute force and exploitation of young labor is at a college football game.
5.
There's one more sporting event we have to include on the list.
Also, those races don't have a traditional drink made of bourbon (mint julep), nor do they encourage everyone to dress like a flamboyant Southern aristocrat.
6.
The world's largest festival of artistic expression is Burning Man.
7.
Almost every candidate has roots in other countries, but, of course, that's what makes them American.
8.
While we're in the region, one of America's great art forms, Blues music, grew up in the juke joints of the South.
9.
The lighting of the approximately 80-foot tall Norwood spruce at Rockefeller Center in New York is practically a national event.
In modern times you needn't look much further than Gospel brunches (wash away your sins from the night before with spiritual songs and mimosas) and megachurches.
The mega-ist of American megachurches is Lakewood Church in Houston, led by senior pastor Joel Osteen.
