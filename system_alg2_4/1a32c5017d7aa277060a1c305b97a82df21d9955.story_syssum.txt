"This used to be a land of bandits, wolves and bears," says Daniele Kihlgren, surveying the countryside around ancient houses of Santo Stefano di Sessanio.
Sextantio (Via Principe Umberto, Santo Stefano di Sessanio; +39 0862 899112) in Santo Stefano is one of several so-called "diffuse hotels" that eschew the usual hotel model of grouping rooms and facilities under one roof.
The hotel even makes use of a medieval brothel.
"That way you'll never lose it," she says.
A path leads to my room -- La Bianca -- one of the closest cottages to the reception (the farthest one lies 200 meters away).
Lying back on my wrought iron king size bed, I spot an old bird's nest among the wood ceiling beams.
"This is what I call 'authentic' Italy," says Kihlgren.
No cars are allowed.
"It's one thing coming here as a visitor, and another living here" says Dina Rusciolelli, owner of La Bettola di Geppetto, the village tavern.
Sitting at the scarred wooden tables of the Cantinone, a large dining room 50 meters from reception, Franco Cannioli serves me pan bagnato -- a dish of bread and vegetables -- with cured meats, lentil soup, pecorino cheese, pears and nuts.
After an afternoon nap, I'm greeted in the hotel's tea room and craft shop by Giovanna Fiorenzi, who sits at an old spinning frame making wool carpets, bed covers and giving weaving lessons to guests.
Breakfast is a buffet table laden with homemade yogurt, pies, ricotta cheese and a ham leg over in the restaurant.
Scicli Albergo Diffuso sits among the ruins of a temple and has Baroque dwellings spread across a UNESCO-listed historical center.
The reception area is a former monastic cell and the restaurant sits inside a crypt.
The Degustation Room, an old mill, serves Tuscany's top cured meats and cheese.
