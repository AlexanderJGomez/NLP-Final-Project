The only one in her Hungarian Jewish family to make it out of the Nazi death camps, life for a long time felt like punishment.
"I told him to go with my mother because mothers are the people who take care of sick children," she cried, while sitting in her Los Angeles, California, home.
Given the horrors she's lived and witnessed, one might think Mann, now in her 80s, would be among those demanding that Nazi war criminals be brought to justice.
Mann doesn't think going after war criminals now is worth the cost and energy, nor does she think the legal process will make a difference to such men who've already lived a full life.

Others on the list include Sandor Kepiro, a former Hungarian officer who allegedly helped kill 1,200 people in Novi Sad, Serbia, as well as Milivoj Asner, a onetime Croatian police chief, now believed to be living in Austria, who allegedly persecuted and deported to the Nazi camps hundreds of Jews, Serbs and Gypsies.
In a written statement about the report, Zuroff said that since the start of 2001, there have been 76 convictions, at least 48 indictments, and hundreds of investigations have been launched.
Like Zuroff, they think pursuing Nazi war criminals is the least that can be done to honor victims.
Thomas, Mann's son, said that going after Nazi war criminals "sends a message to our society and the world that it's not OK to do these things," and that it helps bring awareness "to people who don't know about the Holocaust, and there are lots of them."
By pursuing suspected Nazi criminals, the process "reminds people that this did happen" and shows that "people do care that this happened."
