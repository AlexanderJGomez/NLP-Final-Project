Barcelona moved up to second with a 3-2 win at Villarreal in the late match, their first since the death of former coach Tito Vilanova this week.
Atletico were able to register a ninth straight win in their relentless march to the title with a goal from Raul Garcia just before halftime proving the difference in the Mestella.
Both teams are involved in European competition next week, with Atletico fielding a strong team despite a Champions League semifinal second leg against Chelsea on Wednesday.
Sochaux remained four points from safety in 18th place despite the battling draw.
