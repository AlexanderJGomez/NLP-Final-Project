After nearly 40 years on the throne, King Juan Carlos I of Spain said Monday that he will be stepping down.
Spaniards generally hold King Juan Carlos, 76, in high regard for his service to the nation and his defense of democracy after the death of the dictator Francisco Franco in 1975.
But the King's popularity took a hit in 2012 over a controversial elephant-hunting trip to Africa while the nation was mired in a deep economic crisis.
Most were from people indicating that they were in Spain.
In Franco's Spain, he carried out military training and became the first Spanish officer to hold the rank of lieutenant in all three branches of the military.
On November 22, 1975 -- two days after Franco's death -- Juan Carlos was crowned king of Spain, restoring the monarchy after a 44-year interregnum.
The private trip to Botswana in 2012 became public only after King Juan Carlos fell, broke his hip and was rushed back to Madrid for surgery.
Princess Cristina, the king's youngest daughter, is caught up in a tax fraud and money laundering investigation.
There have been open calls for the King to abdicate in favor of Prince Felipe, who is seen as untouched by the scandals.
