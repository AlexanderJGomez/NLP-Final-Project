Last Thursday, Jeff Courcelle came home from work to find 5-year-old Mocha -- a pure bred fawn-colored Doberman pincher -- hovering over a pile of screws, metal pieces, three watch heads and some chewed leather straps.
Parkinson knew that Mocha wouldn't be able to pass all that leather on her own.
Parkinson and her husband were just expecting to see a couple metal pieces.
The veterinarian removed "about a pound of leather straps and metal pieces and detritus" during the endoscopy, and let nature take its course for the remaining pieces, MSPCA spokesman Rob Halpin said.
The night Mocha stayed in the hospital, a nervous Parkinson stayed awake reading stories about dogs ingesting watches and other objects.
"We've taken every imaginable thing that could fit down the gullet of a dog out with surgery," Halpin said.
"She had a dog that actually consumed her whole dog bed," Parkinson said.
From now on, Parkinson said she will put Mocha in a crate if the dog will be staying somewhere new.
"I am convinced that he and Mocha joined forces here to destroy all of his current watches in order to make room for Apple's new watch."
