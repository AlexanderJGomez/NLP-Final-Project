"The earthquake-proof table started when I was a student in industrial design at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design, Jerusalem," says co-inventor Arthur Brutter.
I looked at pictures of a school that was crushed in the earthquake in Haiti and they really shocked me."
The earthquake-proof table "transforms energy and absorbs it," says Brutter.
Brutter and Bruno estimate that 300 million children live in areas of the world prone to earthquakes with weak school buildings.
Bruno says the awards are nice, but what is more important is to see the product adopted broadly, and used to save lives.
"It's always a good feeling to be recognised, but really it's not awards but exposure leading to the possibility of the table being used ... we want there to be no earthquakes, and we want it (the earthquake-proof table) to be used to save lives."
