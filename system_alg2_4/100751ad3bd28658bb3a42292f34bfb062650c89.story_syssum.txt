Philadelphia (CNN)Hazel Donnelly was taking her husband to the doctor when they got a call that their apartment building was on fire.
Then Red Paw Emergency Relief arrived.
Donnelly was thrilled to learn that Red Paw could provide free short-term care for Kramer.
"Letting them know, 'We'll take care of your animal like it is our own,' it means the world to people."

How is my pet going to get medical care?"
Now, whenever the Red Cross responds to a disaster and discovers that an animal is involved, they call Leary.
She believes it's the only partnership of its kind in the United States -- one she hopes to replicate in other cities.
Rescuing animals is only part of what Red Paw does.
Leary's home is the first stop for most animals that don't need immediate medical care.
Red Paw, which runs on donations, provides care for most animals for around 60 days.
"I cried when we were reunited," said Donnelly.
For Leary, helping families and their pets is what her work is all about.
