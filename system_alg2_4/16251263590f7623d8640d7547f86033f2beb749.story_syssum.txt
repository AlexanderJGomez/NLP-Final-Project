According to the IATA (International Air Transport Association)  2013 is expected to be another profitless year for the European airline industry.
According to the Association of European Airlines, the sector is expected to lose $1.5 billion this year.
As an example, he cites delays: "There can be delays absolutely outside the control of the airline, but the airline still has to not only compensate the passenger but also to meet a whole lot of costs of those delays for passengers."
Despite cutting legacy costs through mergers, consolidation and restructuring, European carriers are still facing the heavy hand of regulation and government, adds Tyler.
Tyler is referring to battle between IAG (International Airlines Group) and the Spanish government.
But in a time of great economic crisis in Europe, where each country is facing their own internal struggle, backing off may just be too painful for government.
