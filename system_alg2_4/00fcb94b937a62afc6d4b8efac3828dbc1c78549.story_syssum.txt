According to the survey, 51 percent feel their own member of Congress should be re-elected -- also an all-time low in CNN polling -- while 44 percent say their representative doesn't deserve to be returned to office in November.
The numbers on both questions are even lower than in 1994, when an anti-incumbent fever helped Republicans win back control of both the House and the Senate from Democrats.
Fifty-six percent of people questioned in the survey say that most Democrats in Congress do not deserve to be re-elected.
The voters' cool view of incumbents of both parties "may hurt the Democrats more because there are more Democratic incumbents," Holland said.
According to the poll, 44 percent of registered voters say Obama deserves re-election, with 52 percent saying the president does not deserve a second term in office.
But a 45 percent plurality say that Obama belongs to the upper class, with 42 percent saying he is from the middle class and 12 percent describing him as working class."
The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points both for all Americans and for registered voters.
