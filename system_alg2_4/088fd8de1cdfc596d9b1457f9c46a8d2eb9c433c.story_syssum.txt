On Sunday, it was discovered that the 900 million-person social network was "testing" a feature that would let people see a digital list of the people who were nearby in real life.
and generally complaining that the feature, which was difficult to find, much less use, invades privacy and will lead to stalking.
It's easy enough to change back, as the site Lifehacker and others have detailed, but that little invasion of the hub of digital identity -- the Facebook Timeline -- was enough to make quite a few Facebookers fire back at their digital overlords.
But it seems like every week has been feeling a little like that.
When the company introduced the now-popular News Feed in September 2006, users threw a fit -- and many abandoned the young network, at least for a moment.
Is the social network turning its back on users?
This theory is put forward by the blog the Next Web, which says Facebook is buying too many new companies -- Instagram, Glancee -- and trying too many new things.
"After all, that's why people started leaving MySpace to go to Facebook in the first place, because it simply tried to do too much."
At Facebook, 2 million complaints per week are handled largely by computers and a staff of a few hundred people.
Even when the site does give its users a chance to weigh in on policy, Madrigal says, users don't take up the offer.
Here's a list of alternatives from our What's Next blog, but none of them seems like actual competition in terms of numbers.
"How much does Facebook value its users?
"Facebook started as a social network that was 'fun' to update your friends and classmates (since it started for-college students only) and grew into something that can affect your career, reputation and invade your privacy," one user, identified as Julie Hancher, wrote.
The more content you absorb, the less valuable your own posts seem."
