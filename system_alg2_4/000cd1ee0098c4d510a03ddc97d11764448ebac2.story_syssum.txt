Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- A ferocious leopard may have killed 15 people in Nepal in a 15-month span, its latest victim a 4-year-old boy that the creature dragged away into the jungle to eat.
More human victims could also be expected if there were more than one or two man-eaters around, he said.
"It could be the same leopard," he said.
After killing its victim, the leopard takes the body away into the forest to eat.
The local administration has sought to raise public awareness of the dangers of going alone into nearby forests and has mobilized the police, armed police force and local people who have licensed guns to hunt for the animal.
The chief district administrator has granted permission for this particular leopard to be killed.
While cases of leopards killing domestic animals are common, and there are sometimes instances of leopards killing people in Nepal, this case is "extreme," Dhakal said.
