Tel Aviv, Israel (CNN) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Sunday he will gather a round table to form a plan aimed at easing the financial burden on Israeli citizens in the wake of protests across the country.
"They open too many doors for rich people to make their own rules, to take our money to get richer.
This is a democracy, it should act like that."
The prime minister agreed with activists' claims that imbalances in the Israeli economy are contributing to the hardships.
Some of them are the result of distortions in the Israeli economy that have taken root here over many long years."
We must not abandon the principals of our economy," Steinitz said Sunday.
Israeli President Shimon Peres also expressed his will to serve as mediator between the activists and the government Sunday.
"Now the young people don't have any hope, and I cannot help them."
