Chris Brown's assault trial has been delayed until Wednesday as lawyers regroup after the conviction of the singer's bodyguard, who was to have testified.
Wynn, who will also decide Brown's case, said she believed the testimony of a limousine driver who said Brown hit Adams before Hollosy attacked.
He could receive probation in the District of Columbia if found guilty, but a Los Angeles judge is waiting on the verdict before deciding whether Brown, 24, will remain jailed in California.
Howard University student Jalen Garrison testified in the Hollosy trial that she and a friend were posing for photos on the sidewalk with Brown when Adams, her boyfriend, tried to snap his own photo with Brown.
A limousine driver testified he witnessed Brown and Hollosy hit Adams.
Hollosy, he testified, packed a 10.
He pleaded guilty to felony assault in June 2009, which resulted in a sentence of five years' probation and 1,400 hours of community "labor-oriented service."
Brown voluntarily entered a rehab program a day after being released from a Washington jail in October, but he was kicked out a few days later for "throwing a rock through his mother's car window" after a family session at the center, a probation report said.
If he is convicted in that case, the judge would decide at a hearing Wednesday whether Brown should complete his probation in jail.
The rehab program told Brown to leave because of that statement and two other rules violations, the document said.
Brown had been working on a highway cleanup labor crew in Los Angeles three days a week to fulfill the 750 hours of service remaining in his probation requirements, his probation report said.
