The Syrian Observatory had said previously that a self-proclaimed ISIS court ordered the release of 29 Assyrian Christian hostages, citing an Assyrian commander.
It was also not clear why only 19 people were let go Sunday.
Also this weekend, the Syrian Observatory reported that ISIS has killed 1,969 people, since the declaration of its "caliphate" last June.
ISIS also executed 125 of its own members for "exceeding the limits in religion," the Syrian Observatory said.
