(Wired) -- Joe Wilkins knew there was only one way to give his supercharged, alcohol-injected Hemi-engined hot rod more power: Put a jet engine in the trunk.
Most people say "Nice car" and assume he's got the obligatory small-block Chevrolet engine under the hood.
Wilkins says the jet engine was probably used as an APU and weighs 110 pounds.
"We want to be the fastest street legal car in the world," he said.
"I'm more than certain the car will go over 300," Wilkins said.
We'll have to experiment in some wind tunnels and end up with a spoiler on the back to keep the front end on the ground."
"I know several people who would be more than interested."
