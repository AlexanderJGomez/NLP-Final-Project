NEW YORK (CNN) -- The Justice Department and federal prosecutors will investigate allegations of discrimination against Latinos by police in Suffolk County, New York, officials said.
In November, seven teenagers were arrested in connection with what authorities said was the racially motivated stabbing death of 37-year-old Marcelo Lucero of Patchogue, New York.
Lucero's stabbing also prompted the Southern Poverty Law Center to undertake an investigation in Suffolk County.
They are frequently run off the road while riding bicycles, and many report being beaten with baseball bats and other objects.
Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer said law center researchers did not speak with him during the course of their investigation.
In January, hate-crime charges were extended against the seven teens charged in Lucero's death to include other assaults on Latino men.
Justice Department spokesman Alejandro Miyas said the department hopes police will cooperate with the inquiry and work with investigators.
"We have very good relationship with our minority community," Dormer said.
