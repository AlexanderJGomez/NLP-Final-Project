But a state investigation into the claims -- which date back to the 1950s and 1960s -- found insufficient evidence to prosecute any former workers at the Dozier School for Boys in Marianna, Florida.
The FDLE investigated allegations made by a group of men who said they were beaten and sexually abused when they attended the school about five decades ago.
"FDLE is whitewashing this thing like you wouldn't believe," said Colon, who was interviewed by the FDLE in the investigation.
Colon said he was sent to the school for stealing cars, and went to the "white house" 11 times during his 30 months there, where he suffered unimaginable beatings.
The FDLE said its investigators interviewed six former staff members from Dozier and more than 100 former students and their relatives.
Most of the former students interviewed during the investigation agreed that a wooden paddle or leather strap was used for punishment, the report said, but there was disagreement about the number of spankings and the severity.
Crist also asked the agency to look into 32 unidentified graves on the school grounds.
Some of the accusers said the graves -- marked only by white steel crosses, rusted with the passage of time -- contained the bodies of boys who were beaten to death by school workers.
He said he walked into the school's laundry room one day and saw a black teenager inside a large tumble dryer that was running.
Do it!
But the FDLE report said there were inconsistencies in the story and a lack of evidence.
Colon said angrily.
One of the men named in the original lawsuit is Troy Tidwell, a former reform school administrator, who still lives near the school grounds in Marianna.
He said the boys at the school who misbehaved were "spanked."
Colon says the FDLE's report about what happened at the school is wrong, and he wants to do his own investigation.
