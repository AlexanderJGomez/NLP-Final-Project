(CNN) -- After the New Year, it'll be "Downton Abbey" season.
And while she's feeling more open to love -- although not with Allen Leech's Tom Branson, to some fans' dismay -- Mary and her sister Edith are still as combative as ever.
"Mary doesn't know Edith has a daughter," Dockery said.
"There are a lot of questions for Anna and Bates still," Froggatt said.
Now, in the fifth season, "it's an individual journey for each character more so than it ever has been before."
