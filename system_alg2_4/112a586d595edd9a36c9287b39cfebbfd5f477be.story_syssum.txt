Just down the road in Oxford Circus is Tiwani Contemporary, a gallery that specializes in Nigerian art, also run by a woman, this time Maria Varnava who spent her childhood in West Africa.
If female curators are a rarity, Africa-focused female curators are even more so.
Yet the message of these women is not a gendered manifesto but a simple statement of fact: contemporary African art exists.
The page boasts a smiling mysterious mask from Gabon, a bellicose Ife bronze head from the 12th century and a Nok terracotta sculpture from the 6th century BC.
Yet African art is alive.
The art coming from Africa today is as varied, vibrant, exhilarating and bewildering as contemporary art from anywhere in the world.
First the rise of afro-pop music (D'banj, Fuse) then the rise of the African actor (Lupita N'yongo, Chiwetel Ejiofor) and now perhaps the rise of the contemporary African artist (Victor Ehikhamenor, Tamrat Gezahegn) .
To the female curators at the forefront of the movement, I salute you.
