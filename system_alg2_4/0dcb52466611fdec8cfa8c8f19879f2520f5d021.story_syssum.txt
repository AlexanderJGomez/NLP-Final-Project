It's doable, according to the Union for International Cancer Control and International Agency for Research on Cancer, if countries adopt measures to meet the "25 by 25" targets the World Health Organization set last year.
The Union for International Cancer Control -- the largest nongovernmental cancer-fighting organization with more than 760 partners in 155 countries -- organized the day to raise awareness among individuals and governments about cancer and cancer prevention.
In fact, "more (cancer) deaths occur in lower and middle-income countries, than in high-income high cancer countries, even though there are twice as many cases in high-income countries," said Peter Boyle, president of the International Prevention Research Institute in Lyon, France.
According to his report, more than 1.6 million women worldwide will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year, compared with about 641,000 in 1980.
"I was shocked by some of the things we found," Boyle said, adding he believes there are various reasons why women in poorer countries are diagnosed late.
Metastatic breast cancer means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body; advanced breast cancer means it's the most advanced stage of breast cancer that has not spread outside the breast.
By comparison, the report said, "It is calculated that less than 10% of the breast cancer patients in the U.S. are diagnosed with LABC (locally advanced breast cancer).
Two had breast cancer, and one had cervical cancer.
"If every woman in the world had adequate knowledge of breast cancer, had access to early diagnostic programs, had access to high-quality diagnostic services and (was) treated according to the most appropriate protocol for their particular disease, then breast cancer mortality would drop rapidly and significantly and have a profound effect on global women's health," according to the breast cancer report.
