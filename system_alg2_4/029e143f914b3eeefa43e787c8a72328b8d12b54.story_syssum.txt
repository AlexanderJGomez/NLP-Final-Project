Munyonyo, Uganda (CNN) -- Heads of 35 African nations observed two minutes of silence Sunday to honor more than 70 people killed in terrorist bomb blasts in Uganda earlier this month as the African Union summit opened.
The Al-Shabaab militant group, which is currently battling the weak transitional government in war-torn Somalia, claimed responsibility for the bombings, saying they were in retaliation for Uganda's contribution of troops for peacekeeping operations in Somalia.
However, AU Commission Chairman Jean Ping said on Friday that Guinea and Djibouti have battalions of soldiers ready to be be deployed to Somalia.
"While people were enjoying the World Cup, Uganda was having the dark side of it," Jonathan told the conference.
Ping said he has been discussing the issue throughout the week with various African authorities and by the end of the summit, he expects more nations to pledge troops to Somalia peacekeeping efforts.
We have just witnessed AU leadership during the opening of the summit today paying more attention on terrorism coming (from) Somalia," Piebalgs said.
That is why we are working closely with the AU to support the African Union's mission in Somalia ... we pledge to maintain our support."
Some 20 people have been arrested in connection with the Kampala blasts, Ugandan leader Yoweri Museveni told the summit, and have been giving investigators "useful" information about terrorist operations.

Museveni told the summit the mandate of the AU peacekeeping mission in Somalia should be changed, with troops able to beyond Mogadishu and hunt Al-Shabaab and other militant groups.
