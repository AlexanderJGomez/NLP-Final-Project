Indian police have arrested a second man in connection with the rape of a 5-year-old girl in New Delhi, a police spokesman said Monday.
She was found semiconscious three days later.
She later died at a Singapore hospital.
In a recent report, the Asian Center For Human Rights cited statistics it said showed 48,338 child rape cases were reported in India between 2001 and 2011.
Many demonstrators are members of a political party of the leading anti-corruption activist, Arvind Kejriwal.
