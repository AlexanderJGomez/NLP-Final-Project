Hong Kong (CNN) -- Their faces stare from old photos, their voices silent since Super Typhoon Haiyan swept through Tacloban in the Philippines on Friday.
"It's my uncle, my mom's brother is missing.
My cousin is missing with her six children, they range in age from 9 to 19.
"If no one can or is even willing to do it, I can't even begin to imagine the situation there," she said.
So if we can't even pay someone to go in and look for them..." Nemeth said, her voice trailing off.
Nemeth is hoping for a similar tale of survival but so far has seen nothing that has offered anything beyond graver fears that her family has disappeared without a trace.
"According to some Facebook groups, the area my uncle was in, it isn't even there any more."
