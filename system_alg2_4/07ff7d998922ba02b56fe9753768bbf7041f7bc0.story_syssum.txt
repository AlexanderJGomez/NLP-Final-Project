What followed immediately afterward proved it, as a news helicopter tumbled to the ground and burst into flames, with those flames spreading to several parked cars in its path.
The two people aboard the helicopter died in the crash, and another person who'd been in one of the three vehicles that caught fire was critically burned, officials said.
"We want to understand what actually happened, so we can understand what we can do in the future to prevent this from happening," Mayor Ed Murray said.
While KING indicated on its website that it sometimes made use of the helicopter, it was being leased at the time by CNN affiliate KOMO.

Hogenson, from the NTSB, said that his agency would issue a preliminary report in about five days and a full report -- including the probable cause of the crash -- within a year.
