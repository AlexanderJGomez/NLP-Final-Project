"I just thought that no mother should ever be faced with that choice."
The following day, Cutler called her "mom friends" and started collecting gently used baby items.
"So many people have such an abundance, and so many others strive to afford even the basics," Cutler said.
Today, Cutler and her volunteers solicit donations of new or gently used baby items in their neighborhoods.
She works with homeless mothers, teen moms and families who have fallen on hard times and just need a boost.
At a recent Moms Helping Moms event, Harding received clothing, diapers and a stroller.
"New clothes, diapers and wipes, they're a constant expense," Harding said.
Cutler and her group aim to provide more than just goods to the moms they serve.
They deserve all of the basics," Cutler said.
