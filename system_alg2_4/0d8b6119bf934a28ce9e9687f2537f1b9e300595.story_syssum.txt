Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- President Barack Obama held a town hall meeting Saturday with a group of young people in the Soweto section of Johannesburg, with video links to similar groups in other cities in Africa.
"Obviously, he is on our minds today, and we join the people of the world in sending our prayers to Madiba and his family, because he still inspires us all," Obama said, referring to Mandela by his clan name.

Though "some progress" has been made in dealing with extremist groups, "the problem has metastasized" to include more regional terrorist organizations such as Boko Haram in Nigeria, Obama said.
"The number of people killed by terrorist attacks in Africa or South Asia far outstrips deaths by Westerners," he said.
"This idea somehow that we want to get more involved militarily around the world is simply not true," he said.
"We are going to all have to work together to find ways in which, collectively, we reduce carbon," but wealthy countries must do more than companies that are still developing, he said.
If, however, everyone buys cars, installs air conditioners and moves into big houses, "the planet will boil over unless we find new ways of producing energy," he said.
