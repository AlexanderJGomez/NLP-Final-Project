(CNN) -- Lionel Messi scored twice for Barcelona as the European champions crushed BATE Borisov 5-0 to claim their first Group H win in this season's Champions League.
Barcelona are level on four points with Milan at the top of the group, after the Italian champions saw off Czech side Viktoria Plzen 2-0 at the San Siro.
Chelsea are top of Group E with four points from their first two matches, despite conceding a late penalty in a 1-1 draw at Spanish side Valencia.
Valencia are third in the table on two points, after drawing their opening two games, with Genk propping up the others with just a single point from their two matches.
Arsenal are second in the table with four points, two behind French champions Marseille, who lead the way with a maximum six points after cruising to a 3-0 home win over Borussia Dortmund.
Europa League winners Porto went ahead in the 10th minute when Colombian James Rodriguez netted from Hulk's right-wing cross, but the home side drew level 10 minutes later when Roman Shirokov scored from the edge of the area after goalkeeper Helton had deflected a Viktor Faizulin cross into his path.
Shirokov scored his and Zenit's second when converting from close range and Danny added a third 18 minutes from time when turning home Alexander Kerzhakov's cross.
