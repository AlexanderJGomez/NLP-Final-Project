Save the Children Chief Executive Jasmine Whitbread said the "vast majority" of children on their own in Haiti are not orphans, but were simply separated from their families in the chaos.
"Taking children out of the country would permanently separate thousands of children from their families -- a separation that would compound the acute trauma they are already suffering and inflict long-term damage on their chances of recovery," Whitbread said.
The United Nations Children's Fund, or UNICEF, does not facilitate adoptions, but it has been bombarded with calls from people who want a Haitian orphan, said Christopher de Bono, a UNICEF spokesman.
Haitian children must first be fed, sheltered, clothed and given medical attention; the next step is to register them and trace their relatives.
Adoptions without consent are child trafficking.
"It's a bit sad, as I have several wonderful children who waited literally for years for new families, and no one ever came," she said.
For those who want to help Haitian children, Whitbread said, they should donate to aid agencies that are working on reuniting children with their families.
The Red Cross also has set up a Web site to help people searching for relatives, he said.
