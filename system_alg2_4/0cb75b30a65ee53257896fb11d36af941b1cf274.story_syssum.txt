"And I think that understanding the history of the Confederacy and understanding the history of the Civil War is something that every American and every young American should be part of."
As we approach the 150th anniversary of the Civil War, we look back to its centennial in the 1960s.
The crucible of war defined the nation as we know it today, as we became "indivisible" and "with liberty and justice for all" for the first time.

And to know the Civil War, we must know and understand the Confederacy -- in all of its diversity.
