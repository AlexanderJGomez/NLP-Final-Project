Nicholson, roughly 13 years of age, is shown here with five of her sisters and two of her mothers.
Today, as Warren Jeffs sits at Utah's Purgatory Correctional Facility awaiting trial, Nicholson has started talking publicly about her childhood in the church Jeffs led -- the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS).
Jeffs, whose approximately 10,000 followers practice polygamy mainly in Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona, is charged in Utah with being an accomplice to rape by arranging the marriage of a 14-year-old girl to her 19-year-old cousin.
At the age of 14, Nicholson started sewing her wedding dress in anticipation of getting married.
And when it hit me that I could possibly and most likely absolutely would be sharing my husband, I began doubting that I could live that way," she said.
That perspective got Nicholson in trouble at Alta Academy, the FLDS-run high school whose headmaster was Warren Jeffs.
" she said.
It was a common destination for FLDS kids kicked out of high school.
So they packed up a U-Haul and headed toward California.
Within months, her birth mother came for a visit and she also never returned to the church.
As glad as Nicholson is to see Jeffs behind bars and awaiting trial, she finds it unsettling to see a man who led the community in which she was raised now reduced to such a pathetic state.
... And then he looked up at the camera and gave this smirk, and that was the smirk that he would give before he damned you straight to hell or gave you the beating of your life or altered a rule that would absolutely devastate your household," Nicholson said.
