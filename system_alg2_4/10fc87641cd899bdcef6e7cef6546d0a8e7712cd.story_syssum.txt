NEW YORK (CNN)  -- More than $20 million from dozens of clients is unaccounted for in the aftermath of what police say was a murder-suicide by the attorney who invested the money, according to a source with direct knowledge of deceased lawyer William Parente's financial dealings.
Baltimore County, Maryland, police say Parente, 59, killed his family before committing suicide.
The source did not know whether Parente, of Garden City, New York, had actually used the money for any legitimate investments.
Investigators say they found a receipt for the knife in the hotel room where the deaths took place, and the time stamped on the receipt was 5:25 p.m. Sunday.
One of Parente's investors was Queens lawyer Bruce Montague, and Montague's office has heard from 10 Parente clients whose investments are unaccounted for.
The office has referred those clients to the FBI.
On April 16, Montague tried to deposit a check from Parente for $245,000.
Then Montague called the New York attorney general's office.
Gardy said Montague believed he was making money on interest from those loans and would sometimes get a check when the note was paid off.
He would not identify them.
