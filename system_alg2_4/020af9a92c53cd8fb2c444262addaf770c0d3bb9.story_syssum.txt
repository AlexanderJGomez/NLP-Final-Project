Below is an excerpt from CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta's new book,  "Cheating Death: The Doctors and Medical Miracles that Are Saving Life Against All Odds" published by Wellness Central, an imprint of Grand Central Publishing.
Mike Mertz was driving home, an hour after finishing his run as a school bus driver in Glendale, Arizona.
Maybe he was looking for a cheaper gas station than the one on his usual route or was just trying to avoid taking his Saturn over a nasty set of new speed bumps.
The small silver car was piled up against a palm tree, the engine revving at top speed.
The only thing keeping it in place was a stucco wall a few feet from the tree; the car was wedged between the two.
He dragged Mertz out of the car and laid him on the ground.
With a few simple measures -- going against the grain of the medical establishment -- they have found that they can radically improve the odds of surviving a cardiac arrest.
As fellow firefighters scrambled down, Florez thumped an urgent rhythm on Mertz' chest, two hundred compressions over two minutes, before a medic stepped in and delivered an electric shock from the paddles of a defibrillator.
Mertz was back from the dead.
In reality, survival from cardiac arrest outside the hospital is rare.
If your heart gives out while you're walking down the street, the number-one thing that can save your life is to have a bystander who is not only trained in CPR , but willing to help.
Published studies put the rate of bystander CPR at around 20 percent.
In Seattle, which has run massive training programs and public education campaigns since the 1970s, the rate of CPR assistance from bystanders is close to 50 percent.
But how?
