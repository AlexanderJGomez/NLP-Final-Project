Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- A battle raged in a strategically located Libyan city Saturday as state television showed a fist-pumping Moammar Gadhafi visiting a school, his first public appearance in days.
NATO said in the past 24 hours its aircraft destroyed loyalist ammunition stockpiles east of Tripoli that were supplying troops shelling Misrata and other cities.
Opposition spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah told CNN that rebels flew two attack helicopters from Tobruk to join the fighting in Ajdabiya.
The African Union's special committee on Libya -- represented by Mauritania, Congo Republic, Mali, Uganda and South Africa -- will then travel to the Libyan rebel stronghold of Benghazi to meet with the opposition leaders Sunday and Monday, according to the South African government.
Libya also holds a seat on the 15-member Peace and Security Council.
State TV also aired images Gadhafi visiting on Saturday what appeared to be a primary school in Tripoli.
Weldon visited Libya in 2004 when he was a Republican congressman from Pennsylvania and said he was invited this time by Gadhafi.
Peace efforts seemed distant Saturday in Ajdabiya, where Gadhafi's forces attacked with a barrage of artillery fire at the city's western gates.
Burnt carcasses of Libyan army tanks taken out by coalition aircraft three weeks ago litter the road.
"The troops of Gadhafi have good weapons and have training and have leadership and have experience," one rebel fighter said.
