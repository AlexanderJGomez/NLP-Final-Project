PetMatch lets you upload a picture of a dog or cat, or use one from its gallery.
It then tries to find you a pet available for adoption that is the closest possible match to the one you posted.
Of course, it's not perfect.
And, of course, we love our animals for reasons other than their appearance.
We tested the app with a photo of Cash, a gray-and-white Scottish Fold cat in Atlanta, and it returned matches of cats with similar coloring in Jefferson, Georgia; Knoxville, Tennessee; Huntsville, Alabama; Charlotte, North Carolina, and other neighboring states.
And while it will no doubt be helpful to pet seekers, PetMatch is not the only product the folks at Superfish have in mind.
