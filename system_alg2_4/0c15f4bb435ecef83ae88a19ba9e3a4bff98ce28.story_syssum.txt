"He was outgoing -- loved everybody, (was) very known in the community and got along with everybody," his brother Anthony Scott told CNN's Don Lemon.
Dash cam video released Thursday shows the two talking, then shows Scott get out of his car and run.
At the time of his death, Scott owed over $18,000 in back payments for two children and hadn't made a payment since July 2012, according to Charleston County family court documents.
Regardless of why Walter Scott ran, "running from an officer doesn't result in the death penalty," Stewart said.
Anthony Scott said he watched the video that showed his brother getting shot dead, footage that has traumatized the family.
"It was a great celebration," Anthony Scott said.
"It's so tragic."
