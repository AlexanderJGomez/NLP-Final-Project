Washington (CNN) -- We're doing well, President Barack Obama told business leaders Tuesday, but it could be better if not for political hijinks in Washington.
"We have to stop governing by crisis in this town," Obama said, making clear he blamed Republicans for a failure to achieve compromise on major issues such as immigration reform and a comprehensive deficit reduction agreement.
"Congress shouldn't, either."
"We probably need to blow up how" the government contracts information technology services, Obama said.
In a lighter moment, Obama noted that some people call him a socialist, and he said to laughter his accusers need to get out into the world more.
