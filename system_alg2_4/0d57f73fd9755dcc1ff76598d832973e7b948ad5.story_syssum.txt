(CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI's resignation captured the world's attention, and rightly.

We should be concerned about media and popular takes on what Catholicism does look like.
The media covers the pope as Catholicism because it is easy to cover the pope as Catholicism.
Also, despite the Vatican II council of the 1960s, popes kept expanding their authority.
Finally, the U.S. has always had an obsession with the pope.
U.S. Roman Catholics felt pulled between nation and church.
The infamous publisher of anti-Catholic comics, Jack Chick depicts decadent popes lofting ominous speech bubbles, precisely capitalizing on the fact that such scenes make gripping graphic art.
But the pope is not the dope.

Most news accounts added that a majority of U.S. Catholic women used it anyway.

The Old Catholic churches of Europe formed in the late 19th century as harbor for Catholics who rejected papal infallibility; they are in communion with Anglicanism.
Some are CORPUS, a corps of married priests who celebrate the sacraments; Roman Catholic Womenpriests, who like many others are ordaining women; and the Ecumenical Catholic Communion, which has partnered with the other two groups.

Understanding one of the world's most populous faiths needs to encompass all of Catholicism -- not just the Roman version.
