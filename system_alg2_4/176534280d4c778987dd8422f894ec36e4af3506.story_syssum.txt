In June 2006, al-Zarqawi was killed in a U.S. strike.
Its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi said his group will now be known as Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant.
President Obama, the United Nations and some news organizations refer to the jihadist group by the acronym ISIL, which stands for Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant.
The 'L' stands for Levant which is a translation of "al-Sham" -- the word the group uses to refer to itself, Bergen said.
It's the same word in Arabic.
ISIS is an English translation of  the acronym in Arabic for Al-Dawla Al-Islamiya fi al-Iraq wa al-Sham, or the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham.
CNN has been referring to the organization as ISIS, shorthand for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
They prefer to be known either as the Islamic State -- al-Dawla al-Islamiya in Arabic -- or just the State, al-Dawla.
"Those who disagree with them, call them DAIISH," Khalidi said, adding that the jihadists have objected to the name.
