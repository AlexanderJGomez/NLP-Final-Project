ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Officials monitoring the River Tiber in Rome fear it could break its banks as early as Friday evening after a spate of bad weather in Italy -- but do not expect major flooding.
"If there will be no more rain, the situation is expected to stabilize," he said.
"I just recommend people to stay at home and not to rush to the river banks to watch the river swelling," Alemanno said.
One woman died near Rome early Thursday when her car was submerged by a wave of water and mud in an underpass.
The body of a second victim was found in the southern region of Calabria after a bridge collapsed.
