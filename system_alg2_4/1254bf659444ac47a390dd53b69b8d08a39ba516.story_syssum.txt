(CNN) -- Michigan authorities are pursuing a new lead in the case of the infamous Oakland County child killer who abducted and murdered at least four boys and girls in the 1970s.
"Right now we are continuing to excavate the site to see if there is any more evidence we can locate," Shaw said.
The Oakland County Child Killer Task Force was also notified, Shaw added.
Her body was found four days later.
His body was found one week later.
Since this is a vehicle that we have been looking for for years, we will make sure if it's part of the crime scene or isn't, and rule it out.
