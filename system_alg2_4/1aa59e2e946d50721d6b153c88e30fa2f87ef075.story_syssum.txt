Here we present a selection.
--- Reiza Guida, a Jewish girl from South Africa, moved to Italy in 1937 to pursue her studies as a musician, her daughter Rosa Larsen recalls.
"Alone and bereft, my mother ran for her life, escaping the SS (Gestapo) by a hair-breath each time," recalls Rosa, who was just one when war broke out in 1939.
"Here too, we had some very narrow escapes," recalls Rosa, "and my brother and I vividly remember a Nazi officer going from house to house looking for Jews and the two of us hiding and shivering below the boards under the big feather-bed."
With help from British intelligence, Rosa says, she and Mario were reunited with their mother and lived at the large villa from which Reiza hosted ENSA events.

"As I understand it, this was the first U.S Jeep into any concentration camp in Europe," says Heddy, who now lives in Jerusalem.
"I am just skimming over the lives of these people, which were very full," Heddy says.
