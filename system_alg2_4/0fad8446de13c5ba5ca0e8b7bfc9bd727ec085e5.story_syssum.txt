The singer didn't plan on releasing her new album "Rebel Heart" anytime soon, but that all changed after unfinished versions of her newest songs found their way on the Internet.
Madonna took to Instagram this past week, thanking fans for not listening to the tracks floating around online.
"Thank you for not listening!
I have been violated as a human and an artist!"
Rolling Stone reported that Madonna had wanted her newest single, "Living for Love," to be released on Valentine's Day, with the rest of the album coming out in spring.
