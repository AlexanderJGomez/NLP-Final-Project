"One of 'em, I think, is Sen. Chuck Hagel."
Now Hagel has been nominated for that same job, by McCain's 2008 campaign rival, President Barack Obama.
When Hagel was elected to the Senate, the two men shared a bond over their service in Vietnam.
Then, Hagel said his friend felt he owed the country his service.
Back in the Senate, the long-time friends and combat veterans both voiced early concerns about the handling of the Iraq war.
A source close to McCain said the friends just drifted apart as friends sometimes do, not because of policy differences.
But citing their long friendship, McCain said he would not oppose Hagel before the hearing.
"Sen. Hagel and I are, are old friends and we had a very frank and candid conversation and I'll be looking forward to the hearing and asking questions," McCain said on January 22.
