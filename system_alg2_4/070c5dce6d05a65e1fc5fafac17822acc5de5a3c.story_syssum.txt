Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- What is most shocking about Gabby Giffords now is how much she looks like her old self.
Stronger, better, tougher.
Being with Giffords, who was shot in the head two years ago during an appearance in front of an Arizona supermarket, it is obvious that she understands and absorbs everything around her.
The right-handed Giffords still has no use of that hand and that arm is paralyzed.
Her right leg is also paralyzed.
She is also still aided by nurses, who come to her home, and by speech therapists, who constantly work with her to help improve her ability to communicate.
That makes Giffords giggle.
For Kelly and Giffords, this is the new normal -- a life together that neither could have ever imagined when they first got together.
Before Giffords was shot, she jetted between her home in Tucson and work in Washington, while Kelly lived and worked in Texas, home of Johnson Space Center.
Giffords says she would like to learn to shoot again, but it's not a high priority.
"It doesn't work!"
"No.
Move ahead," said Giffords.
