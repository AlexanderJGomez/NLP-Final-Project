(CNN) -- Nine civilians died in an attack on a luxury hotel in the Afghan capital, a government official said Friday.
The hotel also was the site of a shooting, in January 2008, that killed seven people.
In January, a bomb and gun attack by the Taliban on a restaurant in Kabul killed 21 people, most of them foreigners.
This came as the militant group threatened to carry out attacks before next month's presidential election.
