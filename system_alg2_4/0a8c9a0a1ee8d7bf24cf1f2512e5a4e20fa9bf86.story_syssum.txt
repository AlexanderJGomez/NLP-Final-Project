(CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of marriage equality this week.
In 2013, the vast majority of Americans have moved beyond prejudice toward gays and lesbians.
What many public figures have known to be true about gay people in their personal lives has been -- until recently -- unacceptable to acknowledge openly in the political realm.
The problem is that even while public opinion has reached an all-time high on marriage equality, old laws discriminating against gay and lesbian Americans have stayed on the books, hurting gay couples and their families.
The court found DOMA to be unconstitutional -- and it also allowed marriage rights for same-sex couples to return to California.
Importantly, the court also strengthened the foundation upon which advocates and officials will one day achieve marriage equality nationwide.
