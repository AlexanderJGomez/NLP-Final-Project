Delayed for months by chaos and conflict, the recovery of wreckage from downed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 has finally begun in war-torn eastern Ukraine, Dutch officials said Sunday.
Dutch officials have commissioned the recovery and transport of the wreckage back to the Netherlands as part of the investigation into the cause of the crash.
Several western nations and the Ukrainian government have accused the pro-Russian separatists operating in the region of shooting down the plane with a missile.
It noted at the time that Dutch investigators still hadn't been able to visit the site amid the unstable situation in eastern Ukraine.
Australia had 38 of its citizens and residents on the plane.
