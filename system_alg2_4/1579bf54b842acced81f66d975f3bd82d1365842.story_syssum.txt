NEW YORK (CNN) -- Early last month, beautiful 25-year-old Laura Garza went missing.
Security video shows Garza leaving the club with convicted sex offender Michael Mele, according to the New York Police Department.
New York state police searched Mele's apartment and court documents indicate officers observed apparent bite marks on Mele's hand and scratches on his back and shoulder.
Laura Garza is still missing more than a month later.
Laura Garza had no idea she was leaving that club with a sex offender.
Laura Garza may have been unaware who she was with that night, but the legal system certainly knew him.
In a sane world, Mele is not a free man on that night, able to allegedly target Laura Garza.
As a nation, we must realize there is no such thing as a "minor" sexual offense -- because sex offenders often start small and graduate to more serious crimes.
Sex offenders start off by nabbing the easy prey -- committing the so-called "minor" sexual offenses like flashing random women, or the crimes Michael Mele committed.
But it's too late.
In the same Justice Department study, on average, the sex offenders served less than half of their sentences.
They can't be worse than sex offenders on the prowl who, compared with non-sex offenders released from prison, are four times more likely to be rearrested for a sex crime, according to a government study.
I see it.
