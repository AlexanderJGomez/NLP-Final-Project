MUMBAI, India (CNN) -- Shweta Gupta knows exactly what kind of groom she wants: he should be educated, well settled and live in a good location --- one that must be in India.
"Yeah, I hate to say it but the NRI man seems to be out of favor with the Indian woman," said Gaurav Rakshit of Shaadi.com, a matrimonial search engine used by 14 million people globally.
Why?
"Suppose there is no job security, then again he would have to come to India, then again he would have to find a job for himself, so I would prefer both of them to be here.
Arranged marriages are still the norm in India and parents play an active role in choosing a life partner for their children.
Shweta Gupta is currently pursuing an MBA in Mumbai and is confident of getting good job offers in India --- another reason she would not want to risk that by going abroad.
So, who is in?
"It will be a help -- more than a help -- to have a working partner," he said.
That is one tradition Shweta Gupta won't give up.
"My marriage should be fun, it should be remembered by all people," she said.
