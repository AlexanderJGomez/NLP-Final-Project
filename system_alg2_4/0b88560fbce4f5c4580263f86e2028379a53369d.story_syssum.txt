Lahore, Pakistan (CNN) -- Police officer Muhammad Azad spends an hour a day running laps because he is running out of time.
The Punjab police department ordered Azad and tens of thousands of his fellow officers to shape up because police officials said they couldn't find enough fit officers to fill jobs at 40 new state-of-the-art police stations that are scheduled to open by the end of the year.
"They are responsible police officers.
They can do it," Iftikhar said, when asked if the police force will shape up.
His form is far from perfect, and the exercise equipment is old and rusty, but he is determined to shrink his waist and keep his job.
