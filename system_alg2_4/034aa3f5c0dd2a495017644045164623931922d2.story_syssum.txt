Scientists placed the six male volunteers in isolation in 2010 to simulate a mission to Mars, part of the European Space Agency's experiment to determine challenges facing future space travelers.
The simulated trip replicated all aspects of a real spaceflight to Mars, including orbiting the planet, landing and returning to Earth.
"This was like taking a psychological trip to Mars ... it was the first full-duration of a human mission to Mars," Suenson said.
Extra seclusion will allow them to get reacquainted with their surroundings, including sound and light, Suenson said.
