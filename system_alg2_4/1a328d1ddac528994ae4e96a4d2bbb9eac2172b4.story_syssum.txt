And another one.
1.
Why?
Republicans were stunned after the speech.
This convention is done.
"Highly effective Clinton speech.
Mitt's speech should have done this."

While speakers at the DNC Tuesday and Wednesday mostly stayed away from the topic, Clinton answered it head-on in his speech, delivering perhaps his biggest moment of the night.
No.
But are we better off than when we were when he took office?

One week after criticizing the platform that Republicans approved at their convention last week, Democrats got a taste of their own medicine on Day Two of their convention.
Another change restored the word "God" to the platform after the 2012 version omitted it, though it included language on faith as part of American society.

But in speech after speech about the slowly recovering economy, Democrats aggressively pushed a common message: We're all in this together.

"Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are correct when they say that each individual should be responsible.
Van Hollen, who's been tapped to play the role of Ryan in debate prep for Vice President Joe Biden, said Romney and Ryan's "obsession with tax breaks for the wealthy is part of a rigid ideology."
"So when they say they'll turn around the economy, beware.
Watching the convention this week, it seems those attacks fuel plenty of fire against Romney, one that may not die down anytime soon.
