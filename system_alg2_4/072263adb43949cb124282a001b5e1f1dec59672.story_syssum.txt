HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's central bank introduced a $10 billion note worth less than 20 U.S. dollars, as the once-prosperous southern African nation battles against spiraling hyperinflation.
President Robert Mugabe apologized to his ZANU-PF party supporters Thursday for the problems Zimbabweans were facing but insisted his nation has turned a corner in its fight against its worst humanitarian crisis, the state-owned Herald newspaper reported.
But Mugabe -- blamed for the crisis by his critics -- said the worst was over.
Mugabe said Western nations and neighboring Botswana were against the formation of an inclusive government in Zimbabwe.
How could African leaders ever topple Robert Mugabe, organize an army to come?
They are just hollow noises to assure the MDC that the Botswana government supports it and also in response to Britain and America that Botswana is a good mouthpiece of the white men."
