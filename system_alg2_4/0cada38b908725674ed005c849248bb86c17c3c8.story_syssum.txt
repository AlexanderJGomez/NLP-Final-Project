The woman, who was pulled out Friday from the remains of the garment factory, was found in that pool of water, rescue official Lt. Col. Moazzem Hossain told CNN.
The rescue was a bright spot against the grim recovery.
Water may have trickled to the building's basement, where Reshma was found, from recent rains and from water sprayed by rescuers.
Gupta said the woman likely had some sort of access to food, although people have been known to survive a couple of weeks without it.
State-run news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) reported Reshma told her rescuers that she survived on dry food and water that was tossed into the rubble in the first days after the collapse.
She spent the entire time in the dark between floors that had collapsed, according to the BSS report.
