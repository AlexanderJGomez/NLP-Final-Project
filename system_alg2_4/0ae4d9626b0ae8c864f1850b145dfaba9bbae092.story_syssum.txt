I thought 'this is it - I'm not coming out of here,'" said earthquake survivor Anne Vos.
In the 24 hours she spent under the rubble, Vos, 57, said she gave up hope, and accepted she would die.
There wasn't any time to think, but I am lucky I didn't go to the stairs.
I don't know what might have happened.
It was then, in severe pain and struggling to breathe, that Vos realized she may not survive.
Some time after those initial calls, Vos says she passed out.
"When I came to, it (the piece of concrete on her) had moved and I was able to wriggle a bit.
The whole time I was thinking about my family and my friends and I just wanted to make it out.
She said the feeling of relief was hard to describe, especially when she saw the state of the building.
I was just trapped under my desk, you know.
I am scared.
I feel a bit like I have nothing keeping me here.
I think I would be too afraid to go into a tall building for a while," she said.
