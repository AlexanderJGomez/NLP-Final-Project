This next version of Android, called 3.0 or Honeycomb, is its first designed for tablets but will also run on smartphones.
From the website, users can beam the app to any number of phones or tablets connected to their accounts.
Previously, you'd have to open the Android app on a smartphone in order to search for and download programs.
"There are no wires, no syncing to computers, none of that kind of nonsense," Chris Yerga, Android's engineering director for cloud services, said onstage at the Android event.
A new app called Music brings the Android system closer in line with Apple's iPod-iPhone-iPad model.
Honeycomb also has a live video chat function that will let tablet users talk with other people who are using Gmail on a computer.
The new Android software includes improved multitasking functionality, so you can see a window of what apps you were previously using looked like when you closed out of them.
CNN  announced onstage it will offer an Android app with iReport functions and live video capabilities.
The tablets also will be able to run all of Android's 130,000 apps designed for smartphone-sized screens.
You'll need 3-D glasses in order to see the video on the tablet's screen.
T-Mobile and AT&T also announced more information on new Android phones this week, none of which will run the Honeycomb software at first.
