They assured us it was the quickest way out of town, but I was anxious because we had just three and a half hours to reach Kherson where we'd be joining the 43 observers from the Organization For Security and Cooperation (OSCE) international observer team as they attempted to cross into Crimea.
Are you in Crimea?
Yes, they expected to meet armed pro-Russia military forces.
We knew the men guarding the checkpoints up ahead were armed with assault rifles.
At first our convoy was met with celebratory scenes of people waving Ukrainian flags but the atmosphere changed further down the road as we approached the Chongar roadblock.

Still, it was a markedly better and safer way to travel than by car.
We are now all proud owners of these small glowing souvenirs of a journey that may have left us parched from the heat, but which gave us one of the few remaining routes out of Crimea.
