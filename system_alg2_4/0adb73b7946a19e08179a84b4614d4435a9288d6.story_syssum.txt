The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has gained notoriety in recent weeks as the group captured city after city in Iraq.
That's not all.
The land grabs by ISIS now stretch from Syria's Deir Ezzor province to the group's recently gained territories in Iraq's Sunni heartland, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said.
ISIS has gained not just cities, but also some Syrians' claims of allegiance.
But about 30,000 people have fled the town, Abu Leila said.
They had been told to "accept their repentance" after fighting ISIS, the SOHR said.
It announced that ISIS was changing its name to just the "Islamic State."
A group of 11 battalions fighting ISIS in Syria has threatened to stop battling the insurgents by the end of this week if they don't get supplies and support from their Western-backed interim government.
The demands come after ISIS made advances in Deir Ezzor and, more alarmingly, the suburbs of Aleppo -- Syria's largest city, Khatib said.
