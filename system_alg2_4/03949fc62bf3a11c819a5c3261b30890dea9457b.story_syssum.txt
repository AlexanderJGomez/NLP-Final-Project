(CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius was not mentally incapacitated when he shot his girlfriend to death, a psychiatric assessment of the athlete has found.
Pistorius admits shooting Steenkamp through a closed door, killing her, but has told the court in Pretoria, South Africa, that he mistook her for an intruder.
Pistorius' psychiatric testing last month was triggered by the testimony of a psychiatrist who said the sprinter has suffered from generalized anxiety disorder since he was an infant, stemming partly from the amputation his lower legs.
Phelps said Nel appeared to be placing a high-stakes bet that experts would disagree with Vorster's evidence.
When court resumed Monday, the defense called Pistorius' orthopedic surgeon Dr. Gerald Versfeld as a witness.
Nel suggested to Versfeld that it would have been "highly unlikely" that Pistorius would have been able to walk on his stumps without falling if it had been pitch black in the bedroom, given the objects in it.
"The moment there is light available, he will be able to use his vision to balance," Versfeld said, agreeing that if Pistorius had known the objects in his room, that would also have helped protect him from falling.
Lin said it would be "impossible" to replicate the "highly complex sound transmission" from Pistorius' house the night he killed Steenkamp.
If Masipa accepts that Pistorius did not know Steenkamp was the person he was shooting at, she could find him guilty of culpable homicide, a lesser charge than murder, or acquit him, according to CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps.
