Gay and lesbian rights activists are detained in Moscow Saturday ahead of a planned march.
The arrests came ahead of Saturday night's Eurovision Song Contest, which is being held in Moscow.
UK gay human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, in a statement on his Web site ahead of the march, said it was being held to coincide with the final of the Eurovision Song Contest.
I support their cause.
The Eurovision Song Contest, which began in 1956, sees singers and groups from a short list of European nations perform a specially written song before telephone votes from each nation decide the winner.
In recent years, however, eastern European nations, which take the contest much more seriously, have come to dominate.
The organizers of the contest estimate it is watched by 100 million people worldwide.
