"If, as is stated in the complaint affidavit, Jordan and Cody (Johnson) were arguing intensely on the ledge, it hardly seems plausible that the argument would cease abruptly so Jordan could apply a blindfold," says Donahoe's brief supporting a motion to dismiss the case.
Donahoe further slams the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office for its handling of Graham's interrogation and subsequent report based on that interrogation.
On July 7, just more than a week after they got married, Graham and her husband were arguing at Montana's Glacier National Park, according to court affidavits.
Graham said in a court filing that during the argument, Johnson grabbed her by the arm and she removed it, pushing Johnson simultaneously and accidentally sending him off the cliff, according to court documents.
On July 11, according to an affidavit, Graham led a party to a popular spot in the park called "The Loop," where Johnson's body was located and she called authorities.
Five days later, Graham came clean during the FBI interrogation, telling the interrogator that she lied but that Johnson's death was an accident, according to the defense brief.
