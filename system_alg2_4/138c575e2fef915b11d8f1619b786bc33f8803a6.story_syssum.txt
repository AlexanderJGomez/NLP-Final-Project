Michael Hayden, who served as former President Bush's last CIA director from 2006 to 2009, said releasing the memos outlining terror interrogation methods emboldened terrorist groups such as al Qaeda.
That's very valuable information," Hayden said during an appearance on "Fox News Sunday."
It's there."
Hayden said he called several senior White House officials to express his opposition before the president released the documents.
Such techniques "undermine our moral authority and do not make us safer," he said Thursday, when the White House released the memos.
McCaskill, a member of the Senate's standing investigative subcommittee, said the Obama administration made the right decision by agreeing not to prosecute intelligence officers.
Hayden said the administration's decision to release the Bush administration memos will make CIA officials less willing to engage in interrogation tactics now sanctioned by the federal government.
Hayden also said that, contrary to the assertions of many critics, the interrogation techniques in question had forced suspected terrorists to reveal valuable information and made the country safer.
McCaskill told "Fox News Sunday" that the United States will be better off in the long run by clearly prohibiting interrogation techniques such as waterboarding.
