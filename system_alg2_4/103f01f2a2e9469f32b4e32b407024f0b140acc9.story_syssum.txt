Lon Snowden spoke to reporters at Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport as he prepared to return to the United States after a six-day visit, his first reunion with his son since April.
Though Russia granted Edward Snowden a one-year asylum, "that could easily be extended," said his father, who described Moscow as modern and sophisticated.
He added that he did not know where his son was living.
Edward Snowden, a 30-year-old former government IT contractor, collected information on spy programs -- in which the National Security Agency mined phone and Internet metadata from thousands of people inside and outside of the United States -- and exposed the program to the media.
Snowden's father: 'I know my son.
"So many people are so determined in the media to continue to refer to him as a leaker," Lon Snowden said.
The reunion came after times when Lon Snowden said he had not expected to see his son ever again.
Though Edward Snowden revealed the surveillance with the assumption that he would accept the consequences, that does not mean he regrets having fled the United States, nor does it mean he plans to return to face charges there, Lon Snowden said.
"Nobody questions the decision that he has made, because he would be locked in a dark hole at this point, which certain people would love."
