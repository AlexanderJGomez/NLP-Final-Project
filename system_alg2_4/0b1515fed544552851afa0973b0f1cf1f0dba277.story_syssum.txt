(CNN) -- English Premier League club Liverpool have appointed Brendan Rodgers as their new manager.
"I promise I'll fight for my life and for the people in this city," said Rodgers.
The Northern Irish coach led Welsh team Swansea into the Premier League in 2011 and impressed pundits with their fluent passing style as they finished 11th in their first season.
He took over at Swansea in 2010 and led the club into the Premier League at the first time of asking after a win in the playoff final against former club Reading.
They beat Premier League champions Manchester City, Arsenal and, ironically, Liverpool on the final day of the season.
The 21-year-old made 37 Premier League appearances for Liverpool last season, after joining the club from Sunderland in June 2011.
Henderson will be hoping to add to the two international caps he has gained so far in his career.
