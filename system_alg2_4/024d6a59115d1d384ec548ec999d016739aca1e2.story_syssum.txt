Through paint and brushstroke, former President George W. Bush says he has found not only a rewarding hobby but a unique way to express himself and his impressions of 30 presidents, prime ministers and other world leaders during his time in office.
"I think they're going to be (like), 'Wow, George Bush is a painter,"' Bush told NBC's "Today" show in an interview on Friday.

Forty-nine percent viewed him favorably while 46% saw him unfavorably according to a poll last June from Gallup.
Just this week, the Senate Intelligence Committee voted to seek declassification of its report on the secret prisons and interrogation techniques used by his administration on terror suspects after the September 11, 2001, attacks.
He told NBC this will help "make sure the last chapters of my life are full."
Bush said he still has a lot to learn with this hobby.
Family and friends said he is very excited about his work.
Then an art professor at a local university suggested he try doing world leaders because he was good at capturing details.
However, his paintings first came to light after a hacker last year obtained private Bush family emails, which included photos of some of his work.
"And nor do I want my paintings to get out.
I did so because I wanted to kind of shock my instructor."
