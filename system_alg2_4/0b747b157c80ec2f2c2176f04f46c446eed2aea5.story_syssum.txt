But if the Texas Knights, a branch of the Ku Klux Klan based in East Texas, get way their way, you could call it that.
Henry says that in the last few months, he has personally recruited over 40 new members to the Texas Knights.
That is the biggest threat now from groups like the Klan," said Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University at San Bernardino.
As far as racial pride is concerned, KKK recruiter Henry says that "for me, I love my own people ... there is nothing wrong with blacks (or) African-Americans having their pride; Hispanics have their pride, Orientals.
Levin says the Klan has a membership of about 5,000.
That's how it should be."
