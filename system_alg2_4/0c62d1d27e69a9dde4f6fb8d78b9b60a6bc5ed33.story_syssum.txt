Robertson interviewed Meshaal over the weekend in Qatar, where he lives.
"How many Israeli civilians have our rockets killed?
Meanwhile, how many Palestinians has Israel killed?
Sixty-four Israeli soldiers and three civilians in Israel had been killed, according to Israeli officials.)
Meshaal said Israel has a powerful military but the Palestinians will triumph.
We are the rightful owners of the land, and they are the thieves of the land.
For us to kill their soldiers while they kill our civilians is also a victory for the Palestinian cause and Hamas."
We're ready to stop this war."
Hamas has agreed to cease-fires through Egyptian mediators "many times" since 2003, Meshaal said.
"Regardless what the others' positions (are), we stated that we are ready to go as a Palestinian delegation to Cairo in order to talk to the Egyptians so they can hold indirect talks between us and the Israelis, so we can reach an agreement that will address our Palestinian demands, headed by ending the siege of Gaza.
"We the Palestinian people have, since 1948, have listened to the international community and U.N. and international regulations, in the hope they end the aggression against us.
Meshaal said he would support a temporary cease-fire for humanitarian purposes.
