(Tribune Media Services) -- If you think being a secret agent is all just one giant adrenaline rush, think again.
We've got to conduct video surveillance on an always-moving target, decrypt a secret audio conversation when we can barely hear through the static, crack a safe and then escape from a heavily guarded compound.
But I've got a bigger mission ahead this weekend: Can I make a visit to the nation's capital, museums and historic sites at every turn, fun?
I've brought along two sixth-graders from Stamford, Connecticut -- my cousin's son, Max Weinberg, and his friend, Miles Singer -- to see if I'm up to the challenge.
(Memo to parents: If you take kids to a restaurant like this and they've outgrown the kids' menu, suggest they share a meal -- assuming they want the same thing.)
"Our job is to create an experience for kids as well as parents," he explains.
Fall and winter weekends are a great time to visit D.C. with bargain hotel rates.
The boys, of course, would have preferred to never leave the hotel but I promise we can skip all the "boring stuff"" -- like the Capitol Building, the Supreme Court, all art museums and even the White House.
(TIP: Even in the fall, the entire day's tickets had been given out before 10 a.m.
NOTE: Though (free) tickets aren't required September through February, tours still fill up.
Me too.
The Smithsonian museums and the capital will be here next trip.
