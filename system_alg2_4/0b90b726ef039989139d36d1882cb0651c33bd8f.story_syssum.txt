Marijuana activist Richard Lee is a local celebrity in the small district of Oakland, California, called Oaksterdam.
Lee is the founder of Oaksterdam University, which he describes as a trade school that specializes in all things marijuana: how to grow it, how to market it, how to consume it.
Lee also owns a medical marijuana dispensary, a coffee house, a large indoor marijuana plantation, and a museum/store devoted to the cause of legalizing marijuana.
A recent California Field Poll showed that more than half the people in the state, where marijuana for medical use was approved more than a decade ago, would approve of decriminalizing pot.
Democratic State Assemblyman Tom Ammiano is spearheading a cannabis legalization bill in the California Assembly.
Ammiano says there are a number of ways legalized pot could be marketed, "It could be a Walgreens, it could be a hospital, a medical marijuana facility, whatever could be convenient.
"I think we ought to study very carefully what other countries are doing that have legalized marijuana," Schwarzenegger says.
They are up for re-election."
He says voters should not be fooled by promises of big bucks flowing to the state from marijuana taxes.

But a substantial number of Californians seem to believe that no amount of enforcement is going to make pot go away -- and that it's time for the state to begin taking a cut of the action.
