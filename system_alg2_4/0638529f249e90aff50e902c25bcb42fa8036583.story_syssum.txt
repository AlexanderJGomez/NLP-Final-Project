SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- Opponents of California's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriages launched a new court challenge Wednesday, led by lawyers who were on opposite sides of the case that settled the 2000 presidential race.
We're here in part to symbolize that," he added.
"Our Constitution guarantees every American the right to be treated equally under the law," Boies said.
California's Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the marriage ban Tuesday, but left intact about 18,000 same-sex marriages conducted before voters approved the ban in November.
But a coalition of groups that fought the ban in California courts -- including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Human Rights Campaign and the Lambda Legal Foundation -- urged supporters Wednesday to turn their energy toward winning in the political arena rather than the courts.
"Pushing the federal government with multiple lawsuits before we have a critical mass of states recognizing same-sex relationships or suing in states where the courts aren't ready is likely to lead to bad rulings," the coalition said.
"Right now, Californians support traditional, natural marriage 49 percent compared to 43 percent for same-sex marriage," said Garlow, who supported Proposition 8.
"We're going to court because people shouldn't have to surrender their fundamental rights to a popular plebiscite," Olson said.
Vermont's Legislature passed a law making same-sex marriages legal that will take effect in September.
