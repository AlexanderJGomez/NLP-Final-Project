Ocean Sole is a Kenyan recycling company that's crafting whimsical pieces of art and fashion from discarded flip-flops and other plastic junk -- piles of rubbish that wash up on Kenya's sandy beaches.
"It's a trade-based solution to the global problem of marine pollution," says Julie Church, the co-founder of Ocean Sole.
Masses of broken rubber flip-flops dumped in cities and villages are carried by sewage systems, rivers and other waterways into Kenyan coastlines every year.
"Pollution in all our waterways is a big problem," says Church, who was born and raised in Kenya.
But, with curious fascination, Church also watched how local children used this marine debris -- cast-off flip-flops and other junk they'd found by the sea -- to create their own toys to play with.
Inspired by the children's makeshift creations, Church then encouraged the local women to collect, wash and process the thrown-away flip-flops and transform them into colorful artefacts for a profit.
There, Ocean Sole workers go through large bags full of broken flip-flops every day to select the ones they're going to use in their creations.
Church says that Ocean Sole is for her "a means to an end," a more effective way to spread her green message than working as a marine conservationist.
"Certainly about the ocean, doing that through the business of recycling rubber that floats," she continues, "and doing it independently in a relative sustainable and grown up way where you have to have a market and a good product, you've got to be commercial," adds Church.
