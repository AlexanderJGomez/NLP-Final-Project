Washington (CNN) -- Inside a tall, red-brick building in Alexandria, Virginia, there is a federal courtroom just waiting for admitted intelligence leaker Edward Snowden to show up.
That's why a guy in Snowden's position -- now a world away in Russia with a grant of temporary asylum -- has to think about his next move.
In a major victory, Snowden won temporary political asylum in Russia.
Option 2: Negotiate a solution and return to the United States.
Edward Snowden's father, Lon Snowden, hoped at first that there might be a way to arrange for his son to return to the United States.
Option 3: Extradition.
Why?
The chances of the United States quickly ratifying an extradition treaty are unlikely.
Hong Kong has an extradition agreement with the United States.
Experts say it is always a possibility to camp at a foreign embassy in Moscow or elsewhere.
