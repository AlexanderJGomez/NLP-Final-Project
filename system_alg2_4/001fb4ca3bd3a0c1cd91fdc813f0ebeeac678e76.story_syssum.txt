(CNN) -- Sergio Garcia, a 36-year-old undocumented immigrant in California, has held two lifelong dreams: to become a U.S. citizen and to practice law.
But the case raises many questions, particularly among those who have been critical of Garcia's efforts to practice law.
Garcia was born in Mexico in 1977 and taken to California by his parents when he was 17 months old, according to court documents.
Eight years later, at age 17, Garcia again returned to California with his parents and without documentation, though his father had obtained permanent resident status in the United States.
Asked why he didn't choose a different career or pursue other opportunities, Garcia said law was his singular focus.
Now that he has a law license, however, one thing that Garcia will not specialize in is immigration law.
