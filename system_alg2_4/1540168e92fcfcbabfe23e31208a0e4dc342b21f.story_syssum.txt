It's commonplace in this country now: A deranged shooter appears, armed to the teeth, out of his mind.
Everyone ducks or runs for cover.
The Second Amendment!
James Madison and the others who framed this single sentence understood perfectly well that you can't have unregulated mobs running around in the streets with guns.
In the South, they were called "slave patrols," and they were paramilitary groups that regularly patrolled slave plantations to make sure restive slaves weren't going to rise up against their white overlords.Remember the line in the movie "Django Unchained"?
Patrick Henry, George Mason and James Madison knew, as they considered the Second Amendment, that it would be essential if they hoped to get the Southern states to ratify the brand-new U.S. Constitution.
The Southern states were police states designed to keep slaves in check.
James Madison, a slave-holder himself, had no doubt about the need to keep these slave militias going in the South.
In fact, at its headquarters in Washington, the words of the amendment are emblazoned right in front of the entrance.
The idea that owning a gun in America was an individual right only dates to the 1980s.
There just is no right for the individual to bear arms in the Bill of Rights.
Let's say, however, that hunters should have the right to possess and use hunting rifles.
It should be just fine to belong to a gun club and shoot skeet or whatever.
In a country where Americans sense, quite genuinely, that their freedoms have been taken away by the government -- as in the U.S. Patriot Act, as in NSA surveillance -- people feel powerless.
It's time for us to revisit the Second Amendment and get every assault weapon off the streets, for good.
