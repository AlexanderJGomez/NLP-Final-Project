The first rule would put the burden on U.S. food importers to ensure their foreign suppliers are meeting U.S. food safety standards.
With 15% of the U.S. food supply coming from overseas, including 20% of fresh vegetables and 50% of fresh fruit, Hamburg said these regulations are long overdue.
The current food safety system in the United States relies on FDA inspectors at ports of entry around the country physically inspecting food and detaining items that may pose a hazard to the American public.
The rules also propose a preferred vendor program of sorts, giving foreign food companies incentives to comply with U.S. safety standards.
"Once finalized, the rules would ensure that foreign foods are held to the same high safety standards as American products," the Pew Research Group wrote in a statement.
The Center for Science in the Public Interest also said, "Today's long-delayed announcement that the FDA is moving forward on regulations to increase the safety of imported foods is good news and, if finalized, will lead to safer foods.
The act represented the first major changes in food safety policy in the United States in more 70 years.
