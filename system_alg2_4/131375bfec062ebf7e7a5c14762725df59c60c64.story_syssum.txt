Crowds flock to Rynek Starego Miasta, Warsaw's Old Town Market Place.
It's Warsaw in bloom, in many ways: A city thriving, growing and blossoming six decades after much of it was destroyed during World War II and almost 20 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union brought many radical economic and social changes.
To get a feel for the city that was known as the Paris of Eastern Europe before World War II, stroll down Nowy Świat Street, lined with restaurants, cafes, bookstores and small shops.
The street is also home to a sweet Warsaw tradition.
They're best when they're still warm, when it's especially hard to eat just one.
Cobblestone streets lead to the heart of the district: Rynek Starego Miasta, the Old Town Market Place, where visitors are surrounded by picturesque pastel blue, pink and yellow buildings capped by red-shingled roofs and where the mood is as merry as the colors.
To get away from the crowds, return to the Royal Route and head towards the Aleje Ujazdowskie, a grand boulevard lined with embassies.
The serene Pałac na Wyspie, Palace on the Isle, is one of several historic must-see sites in the park.
But any stroll through Warsaw is also a walk through the city's tragic history.
There are many such plaques across the capital.
"Fall in love with Warsaw," the capital invites visitors in a slogan printed on posters all over town.
