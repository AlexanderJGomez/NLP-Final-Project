Editor's note: Dr. Vance Harris is a primary care physician in Redding, California.
Fewer and fewer medical students are choosing primary care and many primary care doctors are leaving the field.
In doing so, I save the system tens of thousands of dollars.
Few of these patients are happy no matter how many times I explain that it is reasonable to treat their reflux symptoms for several weeks before endoscopy.
The cost savings to the system is thousands of dollars each and every time I am willing to make the call and go with the treatment.
A good history and exam allows me to reassure the patient that there is nothing we need to operate on and that the risk of missing anything is low.
How many diabetics do I struggle with, trying to get them to take better care of themselves?
Having me in the system has resulted in savings in the hundreds of thousands of dollars each and every year.
My financial incentive to hang in there and work harder is that I now make less than half what I did 20 years ago.
Isn't it a shame that after all this time and with skills honed by decades of experience, many of us can no longer afford to work as a physician?
Good luck finding internists in your community with only 1 percent of medical students going into internal medicine.
I know this is true because I am struggling to find a primary care doctor to take care of my wife and myself.
