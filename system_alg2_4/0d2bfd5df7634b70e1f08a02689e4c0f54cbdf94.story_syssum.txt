Russell Armstrong's lawyer said he's "100% convinced" Armstrong's role in the reality show created his depression, but he does not blame the Bravo network for his death.
After Taylor Armstrong filed for divorce last month she told People magazine that she was verbally and physically abused during their nearly six-year marriage.
In his interview with People, Russell Armstrong said, "Maybe things happened in the heat of the moment, but it was during a time in our lives that was not characteristic of who we were.
"He did not want the divorce at all, but he was willing to accept her decision," Richards said.
But his downfall was caused by his role in the reality show, he said.
"That's what they were dealing with here," he said.
"There's the appearance that she's moving forward as a celebrity," Richards said.
Still, Richards said he does not blame the network for his client's depression and death.
"Adults need to go into these things with your eyes wide open, (realizing) that if you're going to have a network cover your private life, you become a public figure, people can comment about you and there's a high degree of probability that your marriage will end up in shambles as a result of this newfound scrutiny by the public and by the TV network that is covering our private lives," Richards said.
