(CNN)Kenji Goto had every reason to stay home in Japan.
The experienced journalist explained why in a video shot in October from southern Turkey.
"So I would like to get the story of what ISIS wants to do."
Al Zaim recalled telling Goto, "It's not safe for you."
I am Japanese," Goto said, according to Al Zaim, "I can go."
Goto covered big news stories for years, hoping that by telling them he could make a difference in the world.
While there, Goto came to know another Japanese man, a 42-year-old aspiring security contractor Haruna Yukawa.
In it, the ISIS militant gives the Japanese government a choice to pay $200 million -- the same amount of money Prime Minister Shinzo Abe recently pledged for those "contending" with ISIS -- to free the Japanese men within 72 hours.
On Saturday, the latest ISIS video showed the masked man blaming Japan's humanitarian support of coalition efforts in Iraq and Syria for Goto's apparent beheading.
Speaking out for the first time Thursday, Goto's wife, Rinko, said her husband "was taken from me October 25" although she didn't know it until a December 2 message from his captors landed in her inbox.
I hope our oldest daughter, who is just 2, will get to see her father again," Rinko said on Thursday.
...
He was always saying, 'I want to save the lives of children in war zones.'"
And now Goto has become a victim in a war, a fact that's tearing Ishido apart.
