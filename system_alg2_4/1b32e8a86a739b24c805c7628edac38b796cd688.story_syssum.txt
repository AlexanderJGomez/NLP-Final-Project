Gulfport, Mississippi (CNN) -- Gulf Coast states have seen drops in tourism linked to the BP oil spill in the Gulf, though it has not caused any beaches to close, tourism officials told CNN Wednesday.
"And so we are devastated," she said.
They're canceling, not coming to Florida.
Gov.
The oil is here.
The annual Seafood Festival in the town of Jean Lafitte the last weekend in July has been canceled so resources can be concentrated on the oil, CNN affiliate WWLTV reported.
"I think we are getting word out with the tourism campaign," she said.
In Mississippi, about half of the people who had made vacation plans along the state's coast before the April 20 spill have canceled them, said Ken Montana, president of the Mississippi Gulf Coast Tourism Commission.
The tourism commission has spent $600,000 of its own money for an advertising campaign set to begin Monday "to let people know we are open," he said.
Bob Mahoney, owner of Mary Mahoney's Old French House in Biloxi, Mississippi, said business at his seafood restaurant located 150 yards from the high-tide mark is pretty good.
"The truth of the matter is it hasn't affected me yet," he said.
Whatever happens, though, he vowed to stay put.
