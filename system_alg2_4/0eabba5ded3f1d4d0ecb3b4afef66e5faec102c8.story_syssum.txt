However this is great news for women in tech.
African women can be key power players and the continent's tech scene is a burning star but there are very few women at the forefront of that supernova.
Marieme Jamme, the founder of a great initiative called Africa Gathering is another -- she works to pioneer growth on the continent as well as inspire young African women to tech involve in the technology space.
I think it's time women in Africa stop looking at technology as something that men do.
Women like Rapelang Rabana, co-founder of Yeigo Communications, a mobile VoIP company that was integrated into the Telfree group.
She was also called a tech pioneer by South Africa's Minister of communication at a conference aimed at promoting technology in Africa.
There are power players heading up big corporations or country arms of multinational organizations.
Prior to joining InCharge Global, Bartel-Sam co-founded Platinum Technologies, a company that provides outsourced data processing and contact centre services for U.S. corporations.
Google's Anita Borg's Scholars are also young women to watch.
