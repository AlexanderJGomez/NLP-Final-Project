"So I ran and tried to cover her body and pull her out," Suleiman said.
"We tried to cover her and pull her away but they beat us.
Suleiman is one of three people in the video interviewed by CNN, with one of them saying he was shot.
The military has denied the use of live ammunition.
The images stirred worldwide outrage because of the beating and because she was partially stripped in a Muslim society where women cover themselves for modesty.
The beatings and the use of live ammunition against protesters, particularly women, have outraged Egyptians.
The ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has since expressed "great regret" over the mistreatment of women protesters, but it has not apologized for the assaults, a fact that enrages demonstrators.
Others came to Suleiman's aid, such as businessman Ehab Hanna, who was also beaten up and shot after he tried to help the woman with the veil.
I tried to walk but fell to the ground, so they started beating me and Azza relentlessly," he told CNN.
I did not imagine they would fire live ammo at their people."
He told CNN that he is filing a complaint against military leaders because they "dragged, stripped and beat" women and journalists.
"I tried to help her get up, but the soldiers were brutal even when I told them I was a journalist.
Askar questioned why the woman has not come forward to identify herself.
Where is she?"
"If she comes from a military family then she reserved the right to be transferred to a military hospital even if her father is deceased," said Col. Islam Jaffar of the military's morals department.
