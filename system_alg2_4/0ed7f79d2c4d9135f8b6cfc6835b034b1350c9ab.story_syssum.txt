YANAGAWA, Japan (CNN) -- Wearing a Nashville School of Law T-shirt, Christopher Savoie walked into a second-floor police interrogation room.
Savoie chose his words carefully, lest police Officer Toshihiro Tanaka cut short the rare interview Savoie was granted with CNN on Thursday.
Children have the right to see both parents.
They have charged Savoie, 38, a Tennessee native and naturalized Japanese citizen, with kidnapping his two children -- 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca -- as his estranged wife, Noriko, was walking them to school Monday in Yanagawa, a rural town in southern Japan.
Christopher Savoie had visitation rights with his children, but after he returned from a short summer trip, his estranged wife fled to Japan with the children, according to court documents.
A United States court then granted sole custody to Savoie.
And, police said, the children are Japanese and have Japanese passports.
"Japanese people think she's the victim here," Savoie said.
"In the States, my ex-wife is the one who's in the wrong."
In Yanagawa, those who have heard about the abduction case tend to side with the woman.
"He did it for the love of his children."
"I love you, Isaac, Rebecca," he said.
I am very sorry that I can't be with you."
And from the other side of the glass barrier, he gave a thumbs up, mouthing the words, "Thank you."
