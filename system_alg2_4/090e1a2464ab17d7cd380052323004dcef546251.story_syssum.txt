(CNN) -- One of al Qaeda's most influential figures in North Africa has been killed by French and Chadian forces, a U.S. official said Friday.
Military sources quoted by French media say that in the past few days, Abou Zeid and a substantial number of his fighters were killed during a French bombardment near Aguelhok in northern Mali.
According to analysts, it is an area that Abou Zeid was intimately familiar with, as for years it was his main base of operations before Islamists took over much of northern Mali.
Abou Zeid had been promoted by the emir of AQIM -- and fellow Algerian -- Abdelmalek Droukdel.
When Malian authorities rounded up a number of al Qaeda suspects in response, Abou Zeid sent a hit squad to the Timbuktu home of a senior intelligence officer, who was shot dead.
One of the few Westerners to have encountered Abou Zeid was a French citizen, Pierre Camatte, who was abducted from a hotel in northern Mali in November 2009.
But he seems to be highly respected by members of his entourage."
Abou Zeid made several trips to Libya in 2011, according to one source familiar with intelligence from the area.
He was one of several al Qaeda figures in North Africa who had fought in Algeria's vicious insurgency in the 1990s, when whole villages were massacred and atrocities were committed by both Islamist militants and Algeria's counterterrorism forces.
In December, before the French intervention in Mali, he accused the French authorities of blocking negotiations for their safe release.
Andrew Lebovich, a Senegal-based analyst who recently traveled to Mali, told CNN there is concern that Abou Zeid transported a number of Western hostages with him after he left Timbuktu.
