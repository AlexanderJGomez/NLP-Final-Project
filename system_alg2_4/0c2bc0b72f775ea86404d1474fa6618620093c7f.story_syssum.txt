Foreign ministry spokesman Abubakar Al-Sidiq said that he is not aware of any plans to release Mariam Yahya Ibrahim before a ruling from an appeals court.
She is unlikely to change her mind despite giving birth in prison, says her husband Daniel Wani, who also is a Christian.
She gave birth to a baby girl this week at a Khartoum prison, where she's detained with Martin, her 20-month-old son.

Wani said his wife is a practicing Christian, more so than him, and even had their son baptized.

A CNN request for an interview was denied, and the justice minister said they don't comment on such matters because a final judgment has not yet been issued.
His wife, he said, was raised a Christian by her mother, an Ethiopian Orthodox, after her Muslim father deserted the family when Ibrahim was 6.
The apostasy accusation was added after she maintained she was a Christian, according to her husband.
In addition to the emotional turmoil resulting from the conviction, the couple also have to worry about their children, Wani said.
Wani said he's not been allowed to visit his detained family as much since the apostasy charge was added.
In addition to the death sentence, the court sentenced Ibrahim to 100 lashes for the adultery conviction.
Wani said he was optimistic the appeal their lawyers have filed would lead to the court's ruling being overturned.
Perhaps it will result in the judgment being overturned."
"The fact that a woman could be sentenced to death for her religious choice, and to flogging for being married to a man of an allegedly different religion, is abhorrent and should never be even considered," said Manar Idriss, Amnesty International's Sudan researcher.
The appeals court's ruling could come within the next week, their attorney says.
The last time Sudan executed someone for apostasy was in 1985 when a man criticized Sharia law.
