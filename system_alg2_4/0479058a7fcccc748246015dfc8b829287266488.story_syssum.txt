In its first report last September, the inspector general concluded that the incident in which Secret Service agents brought prostitutes to their Cartagena hotel last spring caused no security threat before President Barack Obama arrived in the country for a summit.
The report made no recommendations, which signaled the watchdog's satisfaction with how the incident was handled.
A morning-after dispute between one agent and a woman over payment led to exposure of what happened and the ensuing investigations.
"This is not a cultural issue, this is not a systemic issue," Sullivan said, arguing that similar misconduct hadn't occurred on thousands of other overseas trips by Secret Service agents.
Seven U.S. Army soldiers, two Marines and an Air Force member received letters of reprimand, while two members of the Navy refused non-judicial punishment and are awaiting court-martial.
