Hoh Indian Reservation, Washington (CNN) -- For the Hoh, life centers on the silver waters just off their reservation.
For tribe member and treasurer Amy Benally, the danger can be seen on the doorstep of her family's home that has stood at the mouth of the river for nearly a century.
At first the waters took out the garage and the small building Benally's grandfather used to smoke fish.
Although the lowlands where her family lived were always prone to flooding, Benally said the water rises more often now.
There is little room for new buildings and even where there is it's unlikely they could be put up -- more than 90 percent of the reservation is in the flood plain, according to tribal leadership.
According to a department study, the coast where the Hoh live could see an additional rise from climate change in sea levels of as much as 3 feet over the next century.
Last year, Penn decided to move away from the reservation.
To rescue the tribe's future the Hoh leadership decided to move most of the reservation to higher ground and purchased new land for the expansion.
For Tribal Chairperson Maria Lopez, the move away from the water won't come soon enough.
"What would happen," Lopez asked, "if a tsunami comes while we are here?"
