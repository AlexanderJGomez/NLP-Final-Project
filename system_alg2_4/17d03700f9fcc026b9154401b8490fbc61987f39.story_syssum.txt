(CNN) -- Maryland became the eighth U.S. state to allow same-sex marriage Thursday as Gov.
The Maryland House of Delegates approved the measure O'Malley signed Thursday less than two weeks after Washington state legislators voted to legalize same-sex marriage.
Voters in North Carolina and Minnesota, meanwhile, will consider proposals in May and November, respectively, to ban gay marriage in those states.
Same-sex marriage became a national issue in 1993, after the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled that a ban on such unions violated the state constitution.
In California, meanwhile, a federal appeals court recently ruled against a voter-passed referendum that outlawed same-sex marriage.
The case appears to be eventually headed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
