A couple of weeks later, in July 2011, Pippen bought nicotine patches, started exercising and never looked back.
"I can remember looking at myself in the mirror thinking how wonderful it would be to just wake up one morning, healthy and physically fit."
Doctors offered to get him into a bariatric center for gastric bypass surgery as well, but Pippen refused.
But Pippen isn't a man to do things halfway, his wife says.
"I think when Kevin made the decision to get healthy, it made it easier for both of us -- that we both had to make time for exercise, and our eating choices had to be healthier."
Pippen took group fitness classes at their gym and swam laps on the weekends.
In the first year, he lost 117 pounds.
Pippen is now maintaining at 182 pounds.
Neither is worried about going back to their old lifestyle; they like the energy these healthy habits have given them too much to quit.
He feels better and he thinks that self confidence shows.
Pippen does kickboxing on Wednesdays and swims laps on the weekends, while Susan runs on the treadmill.
