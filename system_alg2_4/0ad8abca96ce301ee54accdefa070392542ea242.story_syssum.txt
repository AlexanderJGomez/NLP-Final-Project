Colombian World Cup star James Rodriguez became the latest footballer to tackle branded underwear, launching his J10 collection for Bronzini last month and posing semi-naked to show off the goods on offer.
Even though he is approaching 40 -- that's 17 years older than undies rival Rodriguez -- Beckham stripped off again this summer to model his wares.
Martin helps manage the branding and marketing for Ronaldo's CR7 range, which he says is available in almost 100 countries -- its main markets are in southern Europe, Asia and South America -- as well as online.
"The core audience [for the CR7 range] is football fans who aspire to Ronaldo's look and image," Martin adds.
"I'm sure H&M chose David Beckham because he's a very attractive, fit fellow," Seth Stevenson, New York based senior writer for Slate, told CNN.
The pioneer of the celebrity underwear market was, however, not a footballer but Swedish tennis ace Bjorn Borg.
Borg's dashing good looks, like those of Beckham, Ronaldo and Rodriguez, certainly helped him cut a dash in the underwear market but sustaining a successful brand over 30 years relies on more than superficial appeal.
Sports stars arguably make natural underwear manufacturers because they understand more than most about the importance of comfort on the go.
We put out underwear that makes people feel more active and attractive."
Stevenson agrees that true sporting icons stand a better chance of successfully creating a product line that is not directly connected to their core business -- but that even then there could be pit falls.
