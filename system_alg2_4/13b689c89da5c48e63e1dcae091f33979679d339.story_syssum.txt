Saleh remains in Saudi Arabia.
Government spokesman Abdu Ganadi said that Yemen lost a leader who served his country for more than five decades.
The palace attack was planned by the terrorist Ahmar family," Ganadi said.
Hours after the attack, Yemeni security forces pounded al-Ahmar's home, killing 10 people and wounding 35, because they blamed his followers, a Hamil al-Ahmar official said.
It is only a matter of time until the Saleh regime faces the same fate," said Khaled Anesi, a leader in the Yemen Revolution Youth Council.
He said that the Yemeni people will have their goals met within days and the revolution will prosper.
