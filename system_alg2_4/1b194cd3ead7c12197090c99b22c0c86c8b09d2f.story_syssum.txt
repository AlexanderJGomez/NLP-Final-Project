Karzai also said the United States is failing to supply Afghan forces with weapons it needs to fight insurgents.
Karzai also threatened to turn to Russia and China among others if the United States did not supply Afghanistan with equipment needed to fight the insurgency.
Tensions have been further exacerbated by attacks against coalition troops by Afghan troops or insurgents disguised in security uniforms that have left dozens dead.
Karzai laid some of the blame on the United States for the shelling of Afghanistan's eastern border provinces by insurgents inside Pakistan, saying his forces were not sufficiently equipped to respond and the United States should have stepped up.
Panetta said the United States remains committed to timetable to withdraw American combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014.
