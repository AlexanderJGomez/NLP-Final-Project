(Wired) -- Twitter confirmed Tuesday evening that its microblogging site has been shuttered by Egyptian authorities.
"We can confirm that Twitter was blocked in Egypt around 8 a.m. PT today.
"We're not experts on how Twitter is being used in highly developing situations 1000s of miles from our comfortable HQ in SF," the company tweeted from the same handle.
"Twitter, it's almost across-the-board inaccessible in Egypt," he said.
It speculated that the outage may have been from "overload."
"We cannot confirm for sure if twitter.com is blocked," she said in a telephone interview early Tuesday.
