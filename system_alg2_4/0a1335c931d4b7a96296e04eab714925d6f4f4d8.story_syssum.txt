(CNN)In 1982, songwriter San Bao fell in love with musical theater  -- then an alien art form in China  -- when he saw a videotaped version of CATS, which became the longest running musical in Broadway history.
"It takes time for people to appreciate this art form," said San Bao.

Nonetheless, the rave reviews audiences have given to these shows make musical producers like San Bao confident that combining Broadway showmanship with Chinese plot lines will one day result in a sure-fire hit.

Rather than continuing to rely on the government's largesse, San Bao says he is looking for investors to fund his next project and hopes that will give him freer creative rein.
