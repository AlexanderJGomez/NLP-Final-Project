In New York on Monday morning, fresh off a performance for "Good Morning America" -- which he jokingly called "Very Early Morning America" -- the Wallflowers frontman said, "It's not like we were a band that broke up and got back together.
We lost the plot a bit, and we needed a break, so we took one.
The Wallflowers broke through in 1996 with the quadruple-platinum album "Bringing Down the Horse" before going on hiatus in 2007.
Reuniting gave them a new sense of direction, "like a reset button," Dylan said.
But I'm lucky.
And with the new songs added, "I don't think we sound like 1995 or 2002.
beat them to it, a claim Dylan laughs about.
"Reboot the Mission" even includes a shout-out to Joe Strummer as well as songs paying tribute to ZZ Top.
Most of album's other lyrics address love and spirituality, "but no more than before," Dylan said.
"I mean, the lyrics are planned in advance, but they're not about me, and you won't know the meaning unless I tell you.
"Why did he have to quit?"
To demonstrate, Dylan took a song from the new album at random -- "Constellation Blues" -- and came up with a viable interpretation of it on the spot, giving it a cosmic yet nonsensical meaning probably unintended when he wrote it.
It's not like three-minute pop songs fall out of the sky, but I think if you have to explain the song, it's not a good song.
Now that the Wallflowers are over their hiatus, Jaffee's other group, the aforementioned Foos, are going on theirs, as announced by Dave Grohl while performing in Central Park on Saturday night.
Dylan said.
