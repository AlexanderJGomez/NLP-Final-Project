JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- Israeli officials are seeking a meeting with Turkey's ambassador to protest a show on Turkish television that reportedly depicts Israeli soldiers murdering Palestinian children.
It shows an actor dressed as an Israeli soldier shooting what appears to be an unarmed Palestinian girl.
On Tuesday, a senior U.S. military official said Turkey's decision this week to postpone a NATO war exercise appears to have been a political decision intended to exclude the Israelis.
