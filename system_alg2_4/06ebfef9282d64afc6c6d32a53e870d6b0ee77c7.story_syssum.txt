Rome, Italy (CNN) -- The founder of a Mexican Catholic order sexually abused minor-age seminarians and fathered three children with two women, the religious sect has revealed.
The Vatican started an investigation into Maciel's actions in 2004 and concluded in May 2006 that he was guilty of sexual abuse, the group said.
As a result of the Vatican investigation, however, officials at the Legion of Christ "reached sufficient moral certainty to impose serious canonical sanctions related to the accusations made against Maciel, which included the sexual abuse of minor seminarians.
"
Legion leaders acknowledged the delay, saying in Thursday's communique, "It's taken us some time to assimilate these events of his life.
In addition to sexually assaulting young seminarians, Maciel fathered at least three children, Thursday's statement said.
According to the order, the Legion of Christ has a presence in 24 countries.
The announcement about Maciel comes against a deepening crisis in the Catholic church, which is investigating complaints of abuse in Ireland, Germany, Britain and several other countries.
