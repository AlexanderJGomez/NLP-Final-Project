According to Aruban prosecutors, the missing woman and the suspect arrived on the island July 31 from the United States.
Lopez denied statements by prosecutors that his client is no longer cooperating with authorities in the investigation.
This weekend, authorities said that crews searching for the missing woman have looked in Aruban phosphate mines.
Agents, wearing vests that said FBI and carrying empty cardboard and plastic boxes, arrived around 8:40 p.m. Friday.
"In anticipation of any possible reason of prolongation of the client's detention, we can state that no felony has been committed by him," Lopez said in his Sunday statement.
