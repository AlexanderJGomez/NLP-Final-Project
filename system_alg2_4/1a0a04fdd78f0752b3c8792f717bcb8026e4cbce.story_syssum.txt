(CNN) -- Yes, they exist.
According to the report from the Pew Internet & American Life Project, 92% of respondents who said they aren't on the Internet also said they have no desire to be.
Forty-four percent of adults 65 or older said they don't use the Internet.
A full 41% of Americans who didn't get a high school diploma said they aren't on the Web, compared to just 4% who said they have a college degree.
Even among the offline contingent, the Web's broad reach was apparent.
