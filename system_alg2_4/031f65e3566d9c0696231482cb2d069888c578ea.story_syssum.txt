Charlotte (CNN) -- Four years later, consider the role reversal: As he closes his convention, Barack Obama's greatest challenge is to make the case against change.
Four years ago in Denver, Sen. Barack Obama sold himself as the candidate of hope and change, presenting himself as a different brand of politician, someone who would change Washington -- and the economy -- for the better.
Four years ago, the goal was to expand the map, and the Obama campaign ultimately succeeded.
Still, because of the changed climate, the Obama acceptance speech will close a Democratic convention that for the most part has been a giant get-out-the-vote rally, speakers chosen because of their appeal to specific constituencies (African-Americans, Latinos, suburban women, gays and lesbians) or major battleground states.
While Charlotte has had plenty of contrast with the GOP convention in Tampa, there has been virtually no specific talk of the president's policy goals for the next four years.
For Ronald Reagan, the second term was wrapped as "Morning in America."
And while Obama leads when voters are asked which candidate best understands the middle class, the latest CNN/ORC International polling showed that Romney significantly narrowed that gap as a result of the Republican convention.
Again, that is the strategy behind the convention agenda: careful targeting of the different pieces of the Obama 2008 coalition.
But it's a giant opportunity, his unfiltered chance to make the case against change.
