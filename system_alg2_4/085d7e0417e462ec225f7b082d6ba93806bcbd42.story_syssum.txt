London (CNN) -- A British parliamentary report slammed Barclays bank on Saturday for its "disgraceful" actions that led to a rate-rigging scandal.
Such behavior would only be possible if the management of the bank turned a blind eye to the culture of the trading floor," the report said.
The issue is important because the scandal centered on the rates at which banks lend each other money.
E-mails revealed as part of the rate fixing investigation showed traders were seeking beneficial rates for their trading positions.
"It should be recorded that broader issues with Libor have been a subject of discussion among regulators for years, and there is little dispute that Barclays was both aggressive in its investigation of this matter and engaged in its cooperation with the appropriate authorities," he said.
The bank said it had alerted U.S. and British authorities about suspicious Libor submissions by other banks in late 2008, and was "disappointed that no effective action was taken."
