"You come here when you screw up," Barkley said at a news conference hours after he reported at the Maricopa County jail.
At the news conference, Barkley sat next to Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the self-proclaimed "Toughest Sheriff in America."
"I'm an equal incarcerator," Arpaio said of Barkley, who will be sleeping in one of the tents.
Period," Barkley said.
Barkley wore a red-and-blue sweatsuit, not the black-and-white stripes that other inmates -- who watched the news conference through a chain-link fence --were wearing.
"This man, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, is a role model for all Americans," Barkley wrote in the blurb.
A star for the Philadelphia 76ers and Phoenix Suns, Barkley was named the NBA's Most Valuable Player in 1993 and inducted into its Hall of Fame in 2006.
