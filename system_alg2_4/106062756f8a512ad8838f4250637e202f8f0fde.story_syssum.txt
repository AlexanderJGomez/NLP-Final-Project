According to Cristabal Scarpati, co-founder of the Doma India school in the town of San Luis, these impressive skills have been honed and passed down through tribes, towns and settlements in the region for generations.
"The philosophy of our school is the philosophy that my father learned from an old Indian named Don Cristobal Luna," Scarpati told CNN.
"For many years I traveled the world bringing this message and what we can say is that horses -- regardless of race or color or origin -- are all susceptible to the same stimuli ... like affection, empathy, respect and solidarity," Scarpati said.
"I've never done yoga but now people tell me a little about it I actually think there are many points of connection," he added on the similarities of the concepts.
"The horse can actually produce a calming effect on people," Scarpati said.
