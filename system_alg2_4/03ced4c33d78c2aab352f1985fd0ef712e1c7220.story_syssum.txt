The first Montrose album was the first album I ever recorded and it still stands as one of the best recordings I have ever been a part of.
I had no experience whatsoever; I just wrote the first four songs in my life, which were "Bad Motor Scooter," "Make It Last," "One Thing on My Mind," and "I Don't Want It," played them for Ronnie upon first meeting, shook my hand, and said, "Let's start a band."
I told my guitar player, "I want you to be like that" -- like Ronnie Montrose.
I said, "I'm going to be like that guy.
I was talking to a guy a couple of days after the show, and he said, "That's Ronnie Montrose, and that was his last show.
He said, "Come on in.
You got any songs?"
Like I said, I went from zero to a hundred in the blink of an eye -- all because of Ronnie.
"Nah, nah, we've got to have better songs, we've got to change our image, that kind of music is out."
We butted heads and I got thrown out of the band [after one more album, 1974's Paper Money], but I carried on with that "first Ronnie Montrose" I saw.
The first time Eddie Van Halen and I met, it was around 1977.
He said on the first Van Halen record, he took the first Montrose record in there and said, "Boom.
Eddie had a totally new twist on the whole guitar style thing, but as far as the chording goes -- not his soloing as much as the chording -- yeah, he took some of that big open chord thing [from Montrose].
And of course the fire, too -- Van Halen came out with all that fire, which is Ronnie.
I said to Ronnie, "Come on, man.
And he was in, we were all in.
And Ronnie was in.
It's f***ed up that those songs will never be played by those four members again.
But if you're going to remember him for anything, put on that first Montrose record.
