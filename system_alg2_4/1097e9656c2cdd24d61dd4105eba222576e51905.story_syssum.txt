Chicago workers resurface alleys with permeable concrete that cleans rainwater before it runs into Lake Michigan.
They also make up about 3,500 acres of impermeable surface, which has created a big problem.
The alleys are being resurfaced with concrete, asphalt or paving stones that are permeable -- that is, water runs through them like a sieve to the dirt beneath.
But only about 1 percent of that water finds its way back to the lake, Attarian said.
Additionally, green alleys feature pavement that's high in albedo, or the ability to reflect light.
How green are those alleys?
