Back in the big time, Frankfurt has made a blistering start to its season, winning its first four games before being held to a 3-3 tie by champion Borussia Dortmund.
In 1959, Eintracht won its one and only Bundesliga title and went on to reach the European Cup final the following year.
While Frankfurt did reach the 1980 UEFA Cup, where it lost out to German rivals Borussia Monchengladbach, success has eluded the club in recent history.
Frankfurt made the perfect start when Alex Meier scored with an 18-yard drive after just 20 seconds to claim his fifth goal in as many games.
FÃ¼rth, who was promoted from the second division alongside Frankfurt last year, has struggled so far this term.
If Frankfurt was unsure whether it was back in the big time, then next week will certainly provide a healthy dose of reality.
