Howard Jackson, a prosecutor with the Brooklyn District Attorney's office, told reporters Saturday that Daquan Breland faces a criminal possession of a weapon charge in addition to second-degree murder.
Breland and another young man, Daquan Wright, were apprehended Friday morning by New York detectives and U.S. marshals at a Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, apartment according to New York police Commissioner Ray Kelly.
An eyewitness said Breland opened fire after Wright handed him a gun, according to Kelly, who did not cite a possible motive.
Jackson said Saturday that he personally hadn't yet spoken with Anthony Hennis, though his hope was that he'd be cooperative.
