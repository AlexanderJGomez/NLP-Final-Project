LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigeria has set its sights on making multibillion-dollar oil deals with China amid peace moves with militants.
The changes aimed at the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation will address allegations of corruption and mismanagement, he said.
The state-run China Daily reported in September that the China National Offshore Oil Corporation was negotiating with Nigeria over a $30 billion oil deal.
Oil bandits have plagued Nigeria for years, attacking pipelines and cutting production by over 1 million barrels of oil a day.
Last week, the group said it was calling off the truce, but there have not been renewed attacks.
Nigeria hopes to leverage the fragile peace to reap big dollars from its oil industry, Ajumogobia said.
