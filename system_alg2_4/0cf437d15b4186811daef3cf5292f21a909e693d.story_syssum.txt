Despite a government initiative to crack down on corruption with a two-year plan -- rolled out in October -- and a recent law to protects whistle-blowers, most Moroccans believe that graft is a key issue that needs to be tackled head-on.
"We call to demonstrate peacefully in all the towns to put an end to corruption, to injustice and for a real democracy in our country," explained one youth on a video posted on the movement's Facebook page.
The king is widely revered in Morocco, yet many Moroccans are skeptical about whether real reforms will be implemented in a new political landscape he hopes to unveil in mid-June, after a special constitutional commission finalizes its work on the blueprint.
"The main areas of concern when we talk about corruption in Morocco are the judiciary, police and hospitals," Transparency International's local chief Rachid Filali Meknassi said.
Despite numerous reports commissioned by the government on corruption in the judiciary, along with the establishment of an anti-fraud body and a special "accountability" court, not one prosecution has been processed against a judge.
The court's report focused on graft in the Health Ministry, the National Investment and Development Fund and several local mayors.
"We want a new constitution, which will define exactly what the new rules and regulations are in place to stop corruption," explained Said Benjebli, one of the movement's architects who edits the main Facebook page.
But then even smaller-scale corruption, like those who can't get a job despite having the qualifications, is also important."
