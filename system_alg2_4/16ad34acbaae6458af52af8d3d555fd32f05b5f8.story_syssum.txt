Shoppers Drug Mart pulled Christmas music from its almost 1,200 stores across Canada at midnight Friday after hearing complaints from customers that they weren't quite ready for the season to be jolly.
"I'm so pleased with Shoppers' decision," writes Nathalie Prezeau.
"This is awesome.
"It turns me off of even going into stores over the holiday season knowing it's endless Christmas music everywhere.
It would take the Christmas spirit out of the employees."
The Christmas season is way too short and it stops immediately after Christmas.
"Take the commercialism aside, Christmas is the most wonderful time of year to show love and equality and be giving and kind.
"Depending on how (S)hoppers handles this situation going forward will determine if I will ever continue to shop at shoppers drug mart again," she wrote.
Many of those commenting on Facebook said retailers should wait until after Remembrance Day, Canada's equivalent of Veterans Day in the U.S., which Canada will mark on November 11 or 12, depending on the province.
While the chain is not giving a definitive date when Christmas music will return, it's certainly not forsaking the season.
