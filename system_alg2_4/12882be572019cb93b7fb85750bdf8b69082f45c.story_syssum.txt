But women and men everywhere should be suspicious of egg-freezing as a "solution."
Cattle breeders in the mid-1900s began freezing bull semen so they could impregnate many cows all at once by the same bull.
As commentators have been quick to point out, human egg-freezing is a new technology that carries bodily risk and high rates of failure.
But even if the technology were perfect, the proposal to help women put motherhood on ice so they can focus on their jobs is shortsighted.
The pill helped contribute to the current situation in which birth control and children are seen as a woman's choice and responsibility -- and men, employers and governments need not adapt.
The tech industry has reconfigured the places and even the hours that people work, but it still sets a very demanding pace.
Have a conflict between women's biological clock and work productivity?
To be sure, men also feel pulled by the competing demands of work and family, and there is growing scientific evidence that they too have biological clocks.
Even if cells can be hoarded and stored, time cannot.
Egg-freezing may be an optimal choice for some women, but it is not a solution to the overwhelming pressures that result from companies requiring long work hours and constant availability.
