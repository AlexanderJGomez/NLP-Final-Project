According to a new study released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, norovirus sent nearly 1 million children under age five in the U.S. to the doctor or hospital in 2009 and 2010.
Based on their latest findings, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers said an estimated 1 in 278 kids will be hospitalized for norovirus infection by the time they turn five, about 1 in 14 will visit an emergency room and 1 in 6 will receive out patient treatment.
The surge in norovirus cases may be due in part to better control of rotavirus infection, for which children can be vaccinated.
"Our study confirmed that medical visits for rotavirus illness have decreased," said Dr. Daniel Payne, an epidemiologist in the division of viral diseases at the CDC in a statement.
'This makes it very contagious because when you have norovirus, you are dispersing literally millions of particles.
Until then, the CDC recommends washing your hands regularly, cleaning any infected or contaminated surfaces and laundry and if you or anyone around you is sick, and to wait two to three days after you recover before preparing food for anyone.
