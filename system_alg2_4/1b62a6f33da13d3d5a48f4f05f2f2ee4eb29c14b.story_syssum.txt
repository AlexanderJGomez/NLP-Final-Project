(CNN) -- In Texas, 33-year-old Marlise Munoz's body is being maintained with technology after being reportedly declared dead based on neurologic criteria, meaning her brain can no longer keep her body alive and functioning.
For the medical community and families affected in these cases, thorny ethical issues remain unanswered.
Some believe that the life of the mother is directly linked to the life of the infant.
For others, the mother and fetus are viewed as separate beings with independent interests.
Does the fetus become a ward of the state and the woman's body merely a biologic incubator for the fetus?
Another ethical aspect of this tragic case is the impact on Munoz's medical personnel, who are providing treatments that are not desired by the patient or her surrogate, and who are perceived to sustain death rather than life.
Clearly, the first priority of doctors, nurses and other clinicians is the well-being of their patients.
When doctors and nurses begin to view their actions as causing physical, emotional or spiritual harms to their patients, it causes them moral distress.
There are no easy answers.
Using technology is always a double-edged sword; the very technology that creates hope can also create suffering.
We must engage with our communities about the boundaries of using technology, and what the appropriate interventions are when a person's life is sustained with technology.
If there is uncertainty about the degree of brain damage a person has suffered, then it is ethical to use medical technology to keep him or her alive until a better determination can been made.
We also need to accept the limits of what medicine can and cannot do.
