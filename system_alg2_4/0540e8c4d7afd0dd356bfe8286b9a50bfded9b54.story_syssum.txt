"Brady Bunch" actress Florence Henderson founded a service to help older adults learn about computers.
Now, actress Florence Henderson, otherwise known as Mrs. Brady, has a new mission: Helping older adults learn to use technology.
Florence Henderson: I was terrified of computers, Josh.
I'm taking photos off my camera and actually putting them on the computer.
Facebook, it is so exciting.
Eighteen hours a day.
They'll teach you how to use your computer.
Henderson: You know what, Josh?
And now I can actually see them.
And so I'm encouraging older adults to really stay connected and use your brain.
Henderson: You know what, Josh?
I've always kind of felt that my career was my vocation, and I love staying on top of things.
And I love people.
Henderson: The real story is that he always had a crush on me and he asked me to go on a date with him.
But it was so sweet and so innocent.
