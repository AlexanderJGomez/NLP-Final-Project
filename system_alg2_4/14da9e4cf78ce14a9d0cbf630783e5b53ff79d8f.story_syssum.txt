Apatow's latest comedy "Funny People" pairs Adam Sandler (left) with Seth Rogen (right).
His brand is about as hot as it gets in U.S. comedy these days with his latest offering as director, "Funny People" grabbing the highest share of the American box office with $23.4 million on its first weekend.
"I see all the movies as dealing with my personal problems, whether it's about virginity, bad sex, marital issues, unplanned pregnancy or, in the case of this one, death," Apatow told CNN.
Surprisingly, considering their longtime association, "Funny People" is the first time Apatow has helmed a feature with Sandler in it.
"A little bit of the movie has some aspect of our repartee," the director told CNN.
So we always reminisce about that time because we had nothing going on other than our comedy sets at night."
