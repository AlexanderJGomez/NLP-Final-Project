(CNN) -- More than 2,100 registered North Carolina sex offenders were found on the social networking site MySpace, the state attorney general's office said Tuesday.
MySpace has told North Carolina authorities that the sex offenders it identified have been removed from the site.
North Carolina passed a law last year banning sex offenders within the state from social networking sites where children are members, making it a felony offense.
After discussions with the group, MySpace became the first social networking site to develop technology aimed at finding and removing sex offenders, the North Carolina statement said.
But, Cooper's office said, "the information provided by MySpace does not include sex offenders who have not been convicted, are not registered or may be using aliases on the site.
