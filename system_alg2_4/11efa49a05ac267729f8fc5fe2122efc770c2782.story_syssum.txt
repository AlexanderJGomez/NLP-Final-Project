"This is all I've got, really," Nick says.
And that's what brought him to St. Anthony Residence in the first place.
About 60 late-stage alcoholics live at St. Anthony Residence in St. Paul, which is partly funded by the state of Minnesota, and operated by Catholic Charities.
St. Anthony -- often called a wet house -- operates under the principle that it's safer and cheaper to have these guys drinking in a controlled environment than out on the cold Minnesota streets.
"These are all men that have been through treatment, numerous attempts," says St. Anthony Residence program director Bill Hockenberger.

Catholic Charities operates two in the Twin Cities -- St. Anthony in St. Paul and the Glenwood in Minneapolis -- with the help of state funding.
There was a lot of opposition in Seattle when the residence was first proposed in 1999.
So far, in Memphis, there hasn't been a lot of opposition to building a residence where alcoholics can drink, city administrator Kimberly Mitchell said.
St. Anthony Residence in St. Paul advertises itself as a "cost-effective and compassionate housing option" that "costs less than $50 a night," compared with a night at a detox facility, which costs more than $200.
Dr. Drew Pinsky, an addiction specialist and host of HLN's "Dr. Drew" show, says that the idea of a residence allowing alcoholics to drink raises some concerns.
Then, five years ago, he made his way to the Glenwood, before moving to St. Anthony.
" Nick says.
If I didn't drink, I think, things could have been very different."
"A majority (of the $89) goes to drinking, and I know that must sound horrible to the taxpayers, but that's what it is," he says.
His routine, like that of most chronic alcoholics, revolves around his next drink.
"It's like, what do you talk about?
"Well, that just depends on how much time I have left," he says.
Less than a month after that interview, Nick Lott died at the age of 52 -- a shock to those who knew him.
