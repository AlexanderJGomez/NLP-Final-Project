He is also accused of violating a Department of Defense policy limiting the political activities of service members.
In a January 26 post to the Armed Forces Tea Party Facebook page, Stein called Obama a liar.
Another discussion on the site in March said he would refuse to obey orders given by Obama.
While the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects the free speech rights of ordinary citizens, a Defense Department rule prohibits service members from engaging in some forms of political activity.
Stein has said that has carefully followed the Defense Department directive.
Comments Tuesday on the page were largely, but not entirely, supportive of Stein.
Stein is not the first service member to face controversy over comments about Obama.
