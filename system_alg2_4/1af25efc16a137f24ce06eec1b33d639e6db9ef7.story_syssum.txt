CNN's Jessica Yellin appears live as a hologram before anchor Wolf Blitzer Tuesday night in New York.
said Yellin, waving to Blitzer as she stood a few feet in front of him in the network's New York City studios.
In reality, Yellin -- a correspondent who had been covering Sen. Barack Obama's campaign -- was at the now president-elect's mega-rally along the lakefront in Chicago, Illinois, more than 700 miles away from CNN's Election Center in New York.
CNN dubbed it a "hologram" -- a three-dimensional image that's been reproduced.
"About a dozen years, I've been trying to do it," David Bohrman, CNN's senior vice president and Washington bureau chief, said to Blitzer on "The Situation Room" on Wednesday.
The subject was then filmed with 35 high-definition video cameras, barely larger than average point-and-shoot cameras, which ringed the wall of the circular room.
Hurley said the tiny cameras "talk" to the New York studio's cameras, meaning that when a New York camera moves, it "tells" the cameras in the tent which direction it's moving and keeps the subject in the correct proportions.
On Tuesday night, Blitzer could only see Yellin on a TV monitor across the studio.
Hurley and Oz agree that as good as the image looked on television Tuesday, it can look even more realistic.

For all the preparation that went into the tent and green room in Chicago -- a location CNN staffers dubbed "Casper" after the friendly cartoon ghost -- there was an equally elaborate setup in Phoenix, Arizona, site of John McCain's election night rally.
Hurley and Oz both said they couldn't put a price tag on the total cost of such technology.
The day after her virtual appearance in New York, Yellin said this kind of new technology is what keeps television news entertaining, even when it's presenting important political stories.
This is fun.
