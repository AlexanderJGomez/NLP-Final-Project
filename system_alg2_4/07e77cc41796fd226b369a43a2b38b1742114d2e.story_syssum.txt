(CNN) -- The puppeteer who gave Sesame Street's Elmo his voice allegedly threw a crystal meth sex party for a teenage boy in 2004, according to a federal lawsuit filed this week.
"I am a gay man," Clash, 52, said in a statement in November.
Three other men soon emerged with federal lawsuits, filed last November and December, accusing Clash of befriending them as teenager then engaging in sex with them.
"Clash smoked crystal meth while engaging in sexual activity with Sheldon," the lawsuit said.
"Clash also gave Sheldon 'poppers' as a sexual aide.
Clash resigned from his job on "Sesame Street" after the first lawsuit was filed in November.
Personal matters have diverted attention away from the important work Sesame Street is doing and I cannot allow it to go on any longer.
