If you spend all your time in a web browser and don't want to spend much on a typical computer, a Chromebook would be worth a closer look.
You get the idea.
And finally, there will be a model available later this year with a built-in 4G/LTE cellular connection.
Design-wise, the HP Chromebook 11 sports similar internal specs to an earlier $250 Samsung model; both feature a mobile processor more commonly found in smartphones and tablets than portable computers.
The 4G/LTE model will be available later this year.
