The announcement that Universal Studios plans to donate a portion of the "Fast and Furious 6" DVD, Blu-ray and digital sales to Walker's charity, Reach Out WorldWide, is just the latest instance of the continued buzz that has surrounded the actor since he and a friend were killed in a car crash on Saturday.
"We send our deepest and most sincere condolences to Paul's family, friends and fans around the world," he said.
"Our thoughts and condolences remain with the many friends and family of Paul Walker during this difficult time."
He said the family of the celeb plays a key factor in the discussion regarding the ethics of money making post a star's death.
Production of "Fast & Furious 7," which was filming in Atlanta at the time of Walker's death, has been halted.
Walker played ex-police officer Brian O'Conner in the series, a role which helped catapult him to celebrity.
Ryan apologized via Twitter including saying "No excuse.
"Over the course of the next two days, nearly every heterosexual woman in my life mentioned the death of the Fast and the Furious actor," she wrote.
Such grief could easily calculate to robust sales for the DVD of what may become Walker's last "Fast & Furious" film if the studio decides to scrap the latest production, given the sensitivities of showing an actor who died in a car crash in a film about driving fast cars.
D'Rozario said the success of any sales attributed to Walker is up to those who supported his career.
"The fan base is not going to go away just because a celebrity dies."
