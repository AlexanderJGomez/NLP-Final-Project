New York (CNN) -- A piece believed to be from one of the airliners that hit the World Trade Center towers on September 11, 2001, has been found behind the site of an Islamic community center near ground zero, the New York Police Department said Friday.
Even so, he said investigators are looking at all possibilities, including whether the part was intentionally placed between the two buildings.
National Transportation Safety Board investigators will determine whether the part is from either United Airlines Flight 175 or American Airlines Flight 11, which hit the twin towers, he said.
They called 911 to report that they'd found "apparently damaged machinery," police said.
"The office of the chief medical examiner will do an in-depth examination of the site to see if there are, in fact, human remains there," Kelly said.
The discovery of the plane part comes more than 11 years after the two airliners slammed into the towers of the World Trade Center.
The whole aftermath was uncoordinated.
It was inadequate," she said.
In the years since, a number of pieces of debris as well as human remains have been discovered in Lower Manhattan.
