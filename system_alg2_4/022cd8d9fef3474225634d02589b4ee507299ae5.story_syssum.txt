Wednesday's result was a blow to tea party conservatives who oppose any kind of increase in federal borrowing.
The Democratic-controlled Senate then gave final approval by a 55-43 margin on strict party lines, with McConnell and the other Republicans who helped overcome the filibuster voting against the measure to reduce their political risk.
"Republicans are trying to put tea party politics in the rear view mirror," he said.
On Tuesday, the GOP-controlled House passed the debt-ceiling measure on a 221-201 vote, with only 28 Republicans supporting it compared to the 199 who opposed it.
In the end, House Speaker John Boehner gave up efforts to link the measure to a provision repealing a cut in some military pension benefits.
"It is encouraging that some of my Republican colleagues seem to be regaining their grip on sanity this week," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Wednesday before the Senate vote.
The House easily passed the military pension measure earlier on Tuesday, then passed the clean debt ceiling legislation.
On Wednesday, the Senate also passed the military pension measure after the votes on the debt ceiling legislation.
Republicans across the ideological spectrum agree that another round of political brinkmanship could harm their party after it got blamed for October's federal government shutdown.
