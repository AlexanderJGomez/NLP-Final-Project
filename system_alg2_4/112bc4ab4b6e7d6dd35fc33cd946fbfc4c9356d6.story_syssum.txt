President Bush speaks with Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda at a Sunday news conference in Toyako, Japan.
Japan's Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda also said he would attend the opening ceremony despite concerns about human rights in China that prompted some other European leaders to boycott the event.
Bush assured Japan that the issue of North Korea's past kidnappings of Japanese citizens will not be ignored by the United States.
Fukuda said he believes the United States "has not lost its sense of direction" on the issue.
Bush said the United States and Japan leads the world in research on clean technologies.
With fewer than 200 days left in his term, Bush says he will press other G-8 leaders to follow through on their commitments from earlier summits, but has warned there is nothing he or anyone else can do in the short term about oil prices.
"What's essential in this summit for George W. Bush is to make sure the world economy does not spin downward," he said.
It's really kind of public opinion shaping and trying to get people to agree that issues are important," said Michael Green, now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
