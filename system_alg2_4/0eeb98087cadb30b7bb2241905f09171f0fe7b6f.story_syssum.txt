Martin O'Malley is laying the groundwork for a presidential campaign with the intent of being ready should Hillary Clinton not run, a source close to the governor told CNN.
"In that sense, he is trying to lay the groundwork so that Democrats aren't left without any potential candidates."

During the 2008 primaries -- which pitted Clinton against then-Sen. Barack Obama -- O'Malley was outspoken and raised a substantial amount of money.
The point of all this: Should Clinton run in 2016, O'Malley would likely be a supporter.
