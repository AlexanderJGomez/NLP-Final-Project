Recently, we caught up with Kass at Google's annual Think Health summit, where he spoke to health care leaders and innovators about his work with Michelle Obama on her Let's Move initiative to curb childhood obesity.
You believe we will see the greatest changes to national health when young kids start making healthy eating decisions for themselves.
I see this all the time.
Why?
It's the first lady's experience that little changes can have huge impact.
Really any of the seven MyPlate tips, if we did any of those, we would really have a great impact.
It feels like these problems are just so big, but in the end, the solutions can be quite small, approachable and doable.
What can we learn from the way people eat abroad?
But of course we always have more to learn.
We have a lot of peppers, our zucchinis and yellow squash are just finishing up.

That's what we're doing.
But we just can't have it day in and day out.
I'm also a big oatmeal guy.
