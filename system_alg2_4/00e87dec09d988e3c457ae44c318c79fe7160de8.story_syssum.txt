(CNN) -- The interesting news in the latest CNN/ORC International poll that Bill Clinton is pulling a 66% favorable rating among Americans suggests the 42nd president has the power to help or hurt Barack Obama as the 2012 campaign enters its final five months.
The CNN poll appears at the moment when Clinton has once again been playing an outsize role on the public stage, and many have suggested all sorts of theories and reasons for maneuvering.
A simpler explanation for Clinton's capering -- and one that better fits Clinton's record -- is that he is a permanent political consultant.
Clinton is trying to change the debate in the presidential campaign from one about the past to one about the future.
In 2010, working through Vice President Joe Biden, he urged Obama to make the case that the president had done a number of things to improve the lives of Americans in his first two years and suggested the president campaign on his record.
But the White House resisted this approach, fearing the stimulus and health care reform were not popular enough to brag about and instead tried to make the Republican agenda the issue.
But Clinton's grudge isn't personal; it's about how best to mount and run a campaign.
