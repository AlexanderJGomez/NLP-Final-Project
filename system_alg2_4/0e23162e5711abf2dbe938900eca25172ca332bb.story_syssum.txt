With one hapless episode after another, the rollout of the President's plan to destroy ISIS is beginning to rival the less-than-splendid debut of the Obamacare website.
Ever since the President went on prime-time television to announce his new strategy to "degrade and destroy" ISIS, he and his team have slipped on one banana peel after another.
Who knew after so many contradictions from the administration?
Even as a coalition grows of nations proclaiming their support, questions also rise of just how much -- or how little -- they will actually do.
The administration expresses confidence that a reconstituted Iraqi military along with Kurdish forces, working with American air power, can destroy ISIS in Iraq, but so far, press reports are skeptical.
In truth, Obama and the military have been able to work together in a professional way through most of his administration.
Soon after he took office, Obama felt that through leaks to the press, his generals were trying to box him in on how many additional troops he would send to Afghanistan, trying to push him to higher numbers.
The military worries that Obama and his team will micromanage, especially in Syria -- something that President Lyndon Johnson did with disastrous results in Vietnam.
The White House worries that the military, hellbent upon victory, will accidentally drop bombs on too many innocents, inflaming opinion and making it harder to keep a coalition together.
An additional challenge the administration faces is that the President has now announced America is going to war, but there are virtually no signs of mobilization on television.
In coming days, through his time at the United Nations and back in the White House, the President must dramatically seize the reins of leadership.
And he must mobilize a coalition of nations that takes the fight to the enemy with great urgency.
