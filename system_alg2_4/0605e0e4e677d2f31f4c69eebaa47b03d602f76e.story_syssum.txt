(CNN) -- Google began an ambitious project in 2004: to scan and index the world's paper books and make them searchable online.
More than 20 million books and magazines have been scanned using optical character-recognition technology, making each word or phrase searchable, so snippets of text are part of Google search results.
"As we have long said, Google Books is in compliance with copyright law and acts like a card catalog for the digital age, giving users the ability to find books to buy or borrow," said a Google spokesperson.
Because the company only shows "snippets" of the books in search results, it claims the project falls under fair use.
The books scanned are also primarily nonfiction titles, which have less copyright protection than fiction.
By converting print to digital text, the program has also made it easier to convert titles into more accessible formats, like text-to-speech and Braille.
