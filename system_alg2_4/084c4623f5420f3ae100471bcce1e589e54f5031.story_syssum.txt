(CNN)Last week, I was among 14 American Muslims who met with President Barack Obama at the White House, where I delivered a handmade Valentine's Day card from two California sisters, Sabrina and Saniya.
Yusor Abu-Salha's father has repeatedly stated that his daughter told the family that the neighbor didn't like them because of the way they looked.
Hate crimes and anti-Muslim bigotry have been escalating at an alarming rate, causing fear among families and communities of heinous attacks exactly like the one we witnessed in North Carolina.
A few months before, White posted that "Muslims cannot be trusted no matter how peaceful they appear."
Bobby Jindal warned Americans of fabricated "no-go zones" in the United States where non-Muslims are not allowed to go, and insisted that immigration by Muslims should be viewed as an "invasion," clearly not grasping the fact that Muslims have been a part of America since their forced migration on slave ships.
As a Muslim, it is difficult to go about my life without my faith being attacked on social media, on mainstream cable news and in my community.
As Americans, we want all our children to grow up with the same opportunities.
As we carry the torch for Deah, Yusor and Razan and remember the great things they accomplished in their beautiful lives, let us also honor their memory by ensuring that young children such as Sabrina and Saniya are not targets of future hate crimes.
Let us create a nation where Sabrina doesn't feel the need to ask her President to protect her from hate.
