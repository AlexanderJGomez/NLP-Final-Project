Doctors said Lakshmi was recovering well as she appeared Tuesday at a news conference.
"She is being carried around by her mother and her father."
The surgery involved the removal of the extra limbs and the repositioning of Lakshmi's organs.
However, they were forced to keep her in hiding after they were approached by men offering money in exchange for putting their daughter in a circus.
Planning for the surgery took a month, Patil said, and Lakshmi spent that month in the hospital.
