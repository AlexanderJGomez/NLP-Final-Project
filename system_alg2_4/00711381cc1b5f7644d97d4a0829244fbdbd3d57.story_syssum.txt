(CNN) -- It's a moment familiar to any regular air traveler.
The squeamish gasp.
Turbulence struck the flight, from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Houston, Texas, unexpectedly, injuring seven passengers badly enough to require hospitalization after the pilot diverted the flight to Miami, Florida.
Turbulence, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, is caused by a quick change in air movement.
"Normally, it's an inconvenience," said Kevin Garrison, a retired Delta Air Lines pilot living in Lexington, Kentucky.
And wearing seat belts, aviation officials say, is the best way to stay safe.
"The majority of injuries actually happen to flight attendants," Dorr said.
In Monday's accident, passengers reported they were slammed into the Boeing 767's ceiling -- some said two or more times -- when the plane dropped rapidly.
Passengers said most of those injured were not wearing seat belts.
No passengers were reported seriously injured in turbulence incidents in 2008, and five flight attendants -- down from a high of 19 in 2003 -- received serious injuries, according to the FAA.
All licensed pilots also receive "upset training," which teaches how to deal with extreme turbulence, he said.
