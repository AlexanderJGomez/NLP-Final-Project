The space agency scrubbed Thursday morning's test launch in Florida after a series of delays, the last of which happened because some liquid-oxygen fuel and drain valves failed to open during the countdown, NASA said.
The launch of Orion -- a craft designed to eventually explore deep space -- is to be one of NASA's biggest moments since the shuttle era ended in 2011.
NASA hopes Orion will usher in a new era: Eventual human exploration of deep space.
When it becomes fully operational, Orion's crew module will be able to carry four people on a 21-day mission into deep space or six astronauts for shorter missions.
During this test flight, Orion will climb to an altitude of 3,600 miles (15 times higher than the International Space Station) and will orbit Earth twice.
Though Orion's first flight won't have people on it, it won't go up empty.
