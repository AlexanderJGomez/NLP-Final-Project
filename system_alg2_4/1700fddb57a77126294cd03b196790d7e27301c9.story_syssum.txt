The first woman elected to the White House will answer to many names -- Madam President, ma'am, and, most likely, Mom.
It's not and here's why.
When former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi was first elected to Congress, she was 47 years old and four of her five children were already out of the house and in college with the fifth one in high school.
One name to remember is Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democratic senator from New York.
Gillibrand is on at least one short list (if Hillary Clinton keeps her word about not running for president again) of potential Democratic candidates for the White House in 2016.
McMorris is the mother of a 1Â½-year-old daughter and a 5-year-old son, and wields plenty of political power and influence as the highest-ranking Republican woman in Congress.
These are just two of the high-profile political mothers who can just as easily and naturally manage the Washington power game as they can their children's homework, play dates and soccer schedules.
The new generation of political women can bring to office a set of life experiences that will inform national policy issues in a new way.
A woman who knows that struggle firsthand might just be the kind of candidate who will be elected to the Oval Office.
