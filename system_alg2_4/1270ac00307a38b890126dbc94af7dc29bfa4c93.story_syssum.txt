Chief Petty Officer Terrell Horne was one of two Coast Guard members thrown off their cutter's small boat when the suspect's panga-style vessel "suddenly increased speed and maneuvered directly" at them, then struck the boat, said Capt.
"Chief Petty Officer Horne was an outstanding Coast Guard member," Jenkins said.
Two Coast Guard colleagues on the same small boat "quickly" recovered their shipmates, and all four boarded the Halibut as it headed to the nearest port.
The panga boat fled the scene but was later interdicted by a different Coast Guard boat and helicopter, he added.
