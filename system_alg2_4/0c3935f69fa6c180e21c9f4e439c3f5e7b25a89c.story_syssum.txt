NOAA oversees the National Weather Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the National Hurricane Center and other offices that provide forecasts, severe weather alerts and other important information to the public.
NOAA was forced to reduce its fiscal year 2013 budget by 7%.
"NOAA's plans to furlough operational employees at the National Weather Service as we enter the severe storm, flood and hurricane season is unnecessary and places the public at great risk," said Hirn, general counsel for the National Weather Service Employees Organization.
States like Florida are assessing the effect of federal forced spending cuts on their ability to prepare for upcoming weather events.
NOAA administrators said the impact on public services will be "minimized," and if a major weather event requires more staff, furloughs would be canceled.
Where once there were 10 forecasters per office, now many operate with four or five, he said.
