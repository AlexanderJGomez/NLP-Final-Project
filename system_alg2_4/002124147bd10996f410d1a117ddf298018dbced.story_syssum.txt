The killing and the threat, along with all the evidence ISIS is leaving as it gouges its way across the region, are a direct challenge to the American people, to the U.S. government and to the international community.
The U.S. government has crucial steps to take now.
It is important to prevent ISIS from scoring a recruiting victory among Muslims and anti-Western and anti-American camps by portraying this as a war between Islam and the West, which it is not.
ISIS is the enemy of anyone who does not belong to ISIS.
The U.S. should seek a U.N. resolution declaring that the international community, including the Muslim world, considers ISIS and its methods repugnant.
ISIS didn't just remind us how cruel humans can be; it has taken the use of brutality as a weapon of intimidation, extermination, genocide and recruitment propaganda to new levels.
But it seems no group has advertised its bloodlust with such relish and effectiveness.
If Osama bin Laden weren't dead, he would die of envy.
That the man who murdered him might have been British should erase any remaining fantasy in the West that this gruesome war, now raging in Syria and Iraq, will stay within any country's or any region's borders.
There have been reports of hundreds, even thousands, of Europeans training, fighting and killing alongside ISIS.
Graduates of the Syria war, from where ISIS pushed into Iraq, have killed in Europe.
ISIS can simply not be allowed to keep a foothold in the Middle East.
The strategy of supporting the Kurds and the Iraqis in the front lines is a good one.
That suffering has now extended to Iraq, and it will only become more widespread if ISIS is not stopped.
