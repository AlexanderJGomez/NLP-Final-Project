Key West, Florida (CNN) -- For more than 20 years, the bulletproof museum case housed a small piece of yesteryear: a gold bar recovered from a sunken Spanish galleon.
"This is a special piece," said Melissa Kendrick, executive director of the Mel Fisher Maritime Museum in Key West, Florida.
"Ordinarily people don't get to touch something like that.
"That's why these crimes don't make a whole lot of money for the criminals," said Robert Wittman, a former FBI agent who once headed the FBI's Art Crime Team.
Then, after a security guard left this part of the museum, a man can be seen reaching into the case housing the gold bar and placing the little piece of history into his pocket before exiting the museum.
Treasure hunter and salvor Mel Fisher recovered the solid gold bar from the wreck of the Santa Margarita in 1980.
Fisher and his team had been searching for the Nuestra Senora de Atocha and instead found the sister ship, the Santa Margarita.
Experts say that about 90 percent of stolen art and artifacts is eventually recovered that but it often takes years to find.
Wittman, the former FBI agent and author of "Priceless: How I Went Undercover to Rescue the World's Stolen Treasures," said the market is incredibly small for these high-profile objects.
They made no money out of the deals.
Wittman said no legitimate collector would take the risks associated with buying stolen goods.

Police said they remain hopeful they will solve the crime but just hope they can recover this golden piece of history.
