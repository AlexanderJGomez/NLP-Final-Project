(CNN) -- The former Penn State assistant football coach currently awaiting trial on child sex assault charges can visit with some of his grandchildren, a judge ruled Monday.
Sandusky will be allowed to visit with eight of his grandchildren under parental supervision, Cleland ruled.
Cleland denied that request Monday, ruling that prosecutors did not present any evidence showing that Sandusky had tried to contact children at the school.
He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Both of them have pleaded not guilty.
