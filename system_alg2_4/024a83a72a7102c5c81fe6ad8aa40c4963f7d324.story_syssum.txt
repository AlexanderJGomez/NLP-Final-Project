Hong Kong (CNN) -- As the attention of the rugby world is drawn to Hong Kong this weekend for the Rugby Sevens, corporations are looking to capitalize on a sport that soon will become an Olympic event.
But is the right place the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens?
The HK Sevens is a very popular tournament but was much more standalone than it is now," said Giles Morgan, HSBC Group head of Sponsorship and Events.
But while HSBC has ramped up its sponsorship investment in Hong Kong, the "world's local bank" is winding down some of its Asian retail operations -- notably in Japan and Thailand, while cutting 30,000 workers worldwide by the end of next year.
We are targeting key demographics and key geographies.
And it has grown.
Morgan declined to comment on how much HSBC actually invests in sponsoring this year's Hong Kong Sevens but he says the bank aims for a three-to-one return on sponsorship investment.
In Hong Kong, there's only one Rugby Sevens Championship.
HSBC is sharing title sponsorship of the Rugby Sevens with Cathay Pacific, whose global hub is Hong Kong.
Cathay has been investing in the Hong Kong Sevens for much of the last 35 years.
The Hong Kong Tourism Board says last year's Rugby Sevens drew in more than 21,000 spectators from overseas.
