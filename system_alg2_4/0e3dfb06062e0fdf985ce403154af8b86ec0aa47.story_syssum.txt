Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The copyright to a home movie of Marilyn Monroe "just sitting around" with friends will be offered through an online auction this week, according to a man who found the film while researching the actress' death.
Morgan said he paid $275,000 for the faded color film because it is "very rare" to find images of the actress' private moments.
Monroe changed her name from Norma Jeane Baker to Marilyn Monroe early in her acting and modeling career.
"We were just getting together," Gretchen said.
Gretchen retained the copyright, which Morgan is helping her sell through an eBay auction expected to begin Thursday, he said.
