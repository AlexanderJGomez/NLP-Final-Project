(CNN)Chicago's historic Pullman District, a World War II internment camp and a section of Colorado's upper Arkansas River Valley will become the nation's newest national monuments this week, a White House official told CNN.
America's first planned industrial town, the 203-acre site within the present-day city of Chicago has factories and buildings from the Pullman Palace Car Co., a railway car company dating to 1867.
The internment camp, which once held captive 400 civilian internees and 4,000 prisoners of war, will be managed by the National Park Service.
"Browns Canyon is a national treasure with a long history of bipartisan support in Colorado," said Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colorado, adding that the monument will stand as a tribute to former Sen. Mark Udall's legacy of protecting this and other Colorado sites.
However, Gardner stated his preference to work through the legislative process.
