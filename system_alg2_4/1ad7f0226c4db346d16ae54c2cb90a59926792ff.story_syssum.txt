"He's my sort of man," Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone says of Russian president Vladimir Putin's influence in the project to stage the nation's first grand prix this October in Sochi.
The Sochi circuit is the culmination of talks that first started in the 1980s, when a plan to run a race through Red Square in Moscow was abandoned -- "they didn't want to replace the cobblestones with paving," says Ecclestone -- and is a major statement of intent from Putin's government to secure the city's post-Games future.
New locations are always a risk for F1's management.
F1 is a world championship, so it's difficult to think of leaving Russia out of a world event like this," Ecclestone said.
So organizers turned to track designer Hermann Tilke -- "nothing is impossible for him," says Zabara -- with the German engineer offering another plan more suitable for the Olympic Park facilities.
"I've had more meetings about Sochi than any other track," the architect says.
Despite his pride at a job well done, Tilke admits he'll feel "very nervous" on the day of the race because the track until then remains a prototype.
The promoter is hoping a race on Russian soil will attract many of the country's F1 fans who already travel the world to watch the championship, as well as creating a new domestic supporter base willing to pay $200 a ticket to attend.
Maybe the same will soon be said of the Sochi Grand Prix.
