French forces are dealing with "determined terrorists" in Mali, said Defense Minister Jean Yves Le Drian, speaking to French radio station Europe 1 from the African nation's capital, Bamako.
The French-Algerian man, who was sought by French police, was detained by Malian officers in northern Mali, Le Drian said.
They also destroyed historic tombs and shrines.
Nearly 4,000 French soldiers are now deployed in Mali, according to the French Defense Ministry website, alongside about 6,300 troops from Chad and the African-led International Support Mission to Mali.
France is using DNA tests to identify the Islamist fighters killed in recent battles in northern Mali, Fabius said.
