At least 60 people were killed and more than 110 were wounded Sunday in a Lahore, Pakistan, suicide blast near the country's border with India, police said.
"We will soon release the video of this attack," the statement said.
Many onlookers were crying as they spoke to reporters.
Every evening for 55 years at the Wagah border crossing between Lahore and Amritsar, India, Pakistan's Rangers and India's Border Security Force take part in a lowering-of-the-flags ceremony before sunset.
