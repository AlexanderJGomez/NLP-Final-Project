(CNN) -- English golfer Ross Fisher boosted his Ryder Cup hopes by claiming his fourth European Tour title with a two-shot victory from home hope Padraig Harrington at the Irish Open on Sunday.
36 started his final round badly with a bogey at the third hole, but bounced back with five birdies and an eagle at the par-five seventh to card 65.
Wood held on for a tie for third after a closing 68 which featured six birdies and three bogeys, joining Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano on 270 after the Spaniard shot a flawless 67.
He had been four ahead at the halfway stage, but two early bogeys saw that cut before he bounced back with five birdies in six holes from the 12th for a four-under 66.
