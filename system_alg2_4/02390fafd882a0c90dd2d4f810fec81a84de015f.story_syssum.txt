"It is a human right if you were born a male or female and you want to have a sex change or lead a life of a different gender," said Kamnoon Sittisamarn, the spokesperson of Constitution Drafting Committee, which is working on a new draft of the country's constitution.
"It is now time to recognize the existence of the third gender in Thai society," said Sittisamarn.
There's a perception that transgender people are well accepted in Thailand, due to the availability of gender reassignment surgery.
But challenges still exist, several transgender people living in Bangkok told CNN.
Another problem is that the gender marked on government documents doesn't match how individuals identify their gender.
"For trans people, we cannot change our title name.
Asian countries including Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh have implemented policies recognizing third gender in recent years.
And Thailand does not have plans to legalize same sex marriages in its constitution, said Sittisamarn.
