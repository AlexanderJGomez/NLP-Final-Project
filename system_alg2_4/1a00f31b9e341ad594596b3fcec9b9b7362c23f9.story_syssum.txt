The industry has repeatedly promised a "mobile advertising tipping point," yet despite the proliferation in smartphones, new advertising formats and new promises, mobile advertising is yet to come of age.
Whether mobile will kill digital advertising is not the most pressing question the industry faces.
Yet if we include tablets within mobile media, we can predict that mobile advertising will surpass traditional digital spending by 2016.
Seen through an advertisers' eyes, mobile is so much more complex than other media formats.
The mobile landscape is fast-paced and will continue to evolve, meaning existing and new challenges will continue to provoke the industry.
So mobile will certainly challenge digital.
To think that mobile could kill off another media format would completely miss the benefit of mobile devices.
So back to the question, will mobile kill digital advertising?
I don't think so.
