Israeli airstrikes killed at least five more people in Gaza on Saturday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
Less than a mile away from the Qassam mosque, a strike killed two men riding on a motorbike, Palestinian Health Ministry spokesman Dr. Ashraf el-Qedra said.
The Israel Defense Forces said that, since the end of the cease-fire early Friday, about 100 rockets were fired toward Israel from Gaza.
There have been efforts to halt the bloodshed as well as to broach some of the thorny issues related to it.
According to el-Qedra, at least 1,911 in Gaza have died since the conflict began, in addition to just under 10,000 injured.
Israeli officials say 64 Israeli soldiers have died, and three civilians were killed in Israel.
The Iron Dome missile defense system has intercepted many of the rockets Gazan militants have fired at populated areas of the country.
The two groups have been at odds but also made repeated efforts at a unity government, including one earlier this year.
One sad irony of all this bloodshed is that -- according to the Egyptian foreign ministry, which brokered recent talks -- the parties have reached an agreement on most issues.
But Israel was willing to extend fishing rights to only six miles off the coast, said Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri.
Yet Israel is resisting in-depth talks as long as rockets continue to head toward its territory.
