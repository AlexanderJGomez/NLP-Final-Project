By 2007, the Colorado-based company was selling 50 million pairs a year, reaching $850 million in sales.
There were too many Crocs in too many stores, and some people had grown weary of the comfortable, but not exactly fashion-forward, design.
"I think you do get to the point where maybe everybody has a red and a blue and a black pair and they are looking for something else, and that was part of the strategy," said Christy Saito, the company's vice president of product design.
While Crocs clogs were undeniably popular, they were also scorned by fashionistas and people tired of seeing the colorful plastic shoes nearly everywhere.
Those are the ugliest shoes I've ever seen,' " he said.
I love them,' and I said, 'These are Crocs,' " Saito said.
Crocs still sells plenty of its old-school clogs, but the new designs now account for 54% of the company's sales.
"I think this is our biggest challenge as a brand today ... getting people to take a look at us in a different way."
With the new designs leading the way, Crocs is back in the black.
