(CNN) -- Within minutes of the news of his death, the backlash started.
Unlike them, he wasn't always the pacifist he was known for in his later life.
Mandela was branded a communist by the white apartheid government, which made it a crime to be one.
A watershed moment tightly bonded Mandela to Slovo and other communist allies.
Then the government banned the communist party and the African National Congress, which fought for the freedom of black South Africans.
Not really, believes South African historian Sampie Terreblanche.
After his release from prison, Mandela made some high-profile appearances with communist leaders.
"The ANC is not a communist Party," he said.
Police intercepted the plan and arrested Mandela and other ANC leaders.
He may not have been directly behind the attacks, said Hermann Giliomee, a historian from South Africa.
"I think it's a very naÃ¯ve plan with very little outlook for success," the former professor of political science at the University of Cape Town said.
Umkhonto we Sizwe beat the war drum against the "white supremacy" and "the white state."
"He was rather strong against racism," Terreblanche said.
"Umkhonto we Sizwe is a new, independent body, formed by Africans, It includes in its ranks South Africans of all races," the group said in its manifesto.
At a sports match in 1995, as President, Mandela made a gesture of support to white South Africans that drew gasps.
The crowd began chanting his name.
