Atlanta (CNN) -- On September 1, 2012, an adult inmate was attacked at Baldwin State Prison in Hardwick, Georgia.
Eventually, his assailants let him go, which -- amazingly -- puts that inmate in the lucky category.
Thirty-three prisoners and one officer have been killed by other prisoners in Georgia since 2010, according to a report released Wednesday by the Southern Center for Human Rights in Atlanta.
"People who are supposed to be running our prisons have lost control," said Sarah Geraghty, senior attorney at the Southern Center for Human Rights.
In February, a prisoner had three fingers severed by a man with a 19-inch knife at Wilcox State Prison in Abbeville, Georgia.
And on, and on and on.
Last year, some 21,000 men and women were released from Georgia prisons, according to the report.
The report highlights three Georgia prisons as particularly dangerous: Baldwin State Prison, Hays State Prison and Smith State Prison.
The center says three times as many prisoners were killed in Georgia in 2012, as compared to 10 years ago, and that in that one year, Georgia had more homicides in its state prisons than some other states' prisons had in the last 10 years.
"The U.S. Department of Justice should launch a thorough investigation," reads the center's report.
