(CNN) -- At first, Miguel Hernandez thought it was a mistake, or worse, a joke.
More likely, Hernandez was one of hundreds of undocumented immigrants released from detention because of looming budget cuts set to take effect Friday absent congressional action.
The decision was made by career ICE employees, an administration official told CNN.
Those who have been released are non-criminals or low-risk offenders without serious criminal histories, ICE spokeswoman Barbara Gonzalez said.
"Detainees with serious criminal histories are a detention priority and have not been released," she said.
Hernandez said he believes some of those released with him are repeat offenders who have been previously deported.
Most were given a paper with a court date, but not Hernandez.
"I don't know why this affects them -- I'm not a criminal," he said.
