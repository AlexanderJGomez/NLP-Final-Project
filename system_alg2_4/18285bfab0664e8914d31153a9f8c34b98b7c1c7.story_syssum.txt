Rami and Kamal, both gay Iraqis, say they rarely show affection for men in public.
The men realized he was gay, Kamal said, when he took his shirt off and they saw that his chest was shaved.

Only once, he said, was he allowed to talk to his family during captivity.
CNN spoke with Kamal, now 18, and his 21-year-old friend Rami about what it's like to be gay in Iraq.
The two men rarely show feelings toward each other in public.
Lesbians are also victims of harassment and violence, but not nearly as often as gay men.
"Militias are reportedly threatening families of men believed to be homosexual, stating that they will begin killing family members unless the men are handed over or killed by the family," it said.
"Gay men and lesbians in Iraq face a lot of risks right now, because homosexuality is sometimes interpreted by people in Iraq as being a Western import," said Scott Portman with the Heartland Alliance, a group that promotes human rights worldwide.
Kamal and Rami say the dangers are all too real in Baghdad -- and they live in secrecy not to shame their families.
Rami added, "I do not know why people hate gays even though so many have this tendency.
One man said he considers gays no different from "criminals and terrorists."
"One day he told me he would come over to my house and kill me in front of my family," Rami said.
"I told him I would come outside and be killed in the street because I do not want my family to find out I am gay."
Kamal is still tormented by what happened to him nearly three years ago.
"Only my close friend Rami knows about this secret."
