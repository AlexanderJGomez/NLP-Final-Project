Now the company is suing Leibovitz for breach of contract, saying she has "refused to cooperate in the sale of those assets," according to a question-and-answer sheet on the lawsuit issued by Art Capital.
In the question-and-answer sheet, Art Capital says Leibovitz "acknowledged that in order to repay the loan she would sell her fine art, intellectual property and real estate assets.
She authorized Art Capital to act as agent in the sale of those assets through which Art Capital could recoup its decrease in interest rate.
In July, Art Capital filed a complaint with the New York Supreme Court, asking it to uphold the sales agreement it signed with Leibovitz, including its right to sell her art and real estate.
Art Capital has asked for an unspecified amount of damages in addition to the money it says the photographer originally borrowed.
