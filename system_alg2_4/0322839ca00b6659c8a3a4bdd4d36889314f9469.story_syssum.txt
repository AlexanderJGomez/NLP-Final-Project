This is a huge moment for Julianne -- and a huge moment for all of us who have been trying to focus public attention on this staggering disease.
It was terrifying, too, because back then, the disease was surrounded by shame and silence.
Women in their 60s are about twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's as breast cancer.
The truth is, we're right in the middle of an epidemic, but we as a nation are in denial.
It's time to get serious.
Why women?
Today nearly two-thirds of those with Alzheimer's are women -- that's more than 3.2 million women.
Our mission is to enlist women of all ages to get educated, engaged and empowered to instigate change.
And why is it that women in their 60s are so much more likely to get Alzheimer's than breast cancer?
We don't know.
In 2015, Washington will spend an estimated $6 billion on cancer research and $3 billion on HIV/AIDS research, but only $586 million on Alzheimer's.
We're asking women to put together their own "brain trusts" in their communities -- groups that will go out and do some muscular fund-raising.
But equally important, these brain trusts will gather to discuss and disseminate information about what the disease is and isn't.
They'll reach out to help and encourage women whose loved ones have Alzheimer's.
I remember when cancer was a dirty word, and the prognosis was always grim.
Wipe Out Alzheimer's is creating a global community of women activists, agitators and agents of change to do just that.
"Still Alice" shows us that's just not true.
