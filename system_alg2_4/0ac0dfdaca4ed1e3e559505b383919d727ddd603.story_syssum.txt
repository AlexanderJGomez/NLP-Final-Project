Los Angeles (CNN) -- Paul Walker's brothers are helping "fill in small gaps" in "Fast & Furious 7" action sequences not finished before the actor's death, producers said Tuesday.
"Caleb and Cody are helping us complete some remaining action for their brother and fill in small gaps left in production.
"It will allow the character of Brian O'Conner to live on and let us celebrate Paul in his most defining role."
Investigators concluded in a report released in March that speed was to blame in Walker's death.
The high-performance 2005 Porsche Carrera GT was going "between 80 and 93 mph at the time the car impacted a power pole and several trees," the final report said.
Investigators found "no pre-existing conditions that would have caused this collision," the report said.
The crash happened a few hundred yards away on a wide street.
