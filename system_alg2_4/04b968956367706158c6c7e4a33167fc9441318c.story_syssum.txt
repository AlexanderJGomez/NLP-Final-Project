(CNN) -- A South Florida man killed his wife and son with a crossbow, drove 460 miles to try and kill his other son, and then slit his own throat.
The sheriff's report says Maldonado, 53, then drove about 460 miles north to Tallahassee in an attempt to kill his older son, JosÃ© Maldonado, who attends Florida State University.
A short time later, authorities found their bodies in the South Florida townhouse.
"I knew them.
I don't see why parents have to get the kids involved.
