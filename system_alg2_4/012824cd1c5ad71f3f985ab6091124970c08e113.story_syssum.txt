He was also convicted of two counts of sexual assault for attacks on two other women.
She had been sexually assaulted and strangled.
A pair of panties that did not belong to Denison were found near the body, in what police said was a "calling card" that helped them connect Biela not only to Denison, but also to the other assaults.
The woman testified that her assailant asked for her panties and took them with him.
Police released a photo of the panties near Denison's body and a description of the pickup truck.
A friend of Biela's girlfriend saw the photo of the panties, and thought she recognized the truck police described.
