Shift for a second from the very real world of kids, homes, global conflict, and cars to the make-believe world of video games.
Times are good, with double digit growth expected for sales of games this calendar year as well as for the hardware that's used to play those games.
"By any barometer," one company executive said in a conference call with analysts, "[it's been] another outstanding year for GameStop."
Hickey said today he expects that the release of Grand Theft Auto IV could net the company more than $100 million--in a single week.
Another game which should help GameStop tally record revenues this year is the second expansion pack for Blizzard Entertainment's phenomenally successful multiplayer game World of Warcraft.
The first World of Warcraft expansion pack released last year sold 2.4 million copies in 24 hours and 3.5 million copies in the first month, Hickey says.
Hickey, who is projecting that GameStop shares will top $70 in the next year, says investing in the company "offers investors an opportunity to participate in the growth of the video game market with comparatively less operational volatility than publishers and offers [an investment opportunity based] on the remarkable success of the Wii and DS platforms from Nintendo."
