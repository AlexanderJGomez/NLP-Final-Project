Helg Sgarbi has admitted blackmailing Germany's richest woman, Susanne Klatten.
"He confessed that he blackmailed the victims, told them untrue stories," Winkler told CNN.
Authorities said Klatten, who is married with three children, had an affair with Sgarbi.
"She rigorously notified authorities even in light of the uncomfortable public repercussions this would have for her," Appelhans said.
