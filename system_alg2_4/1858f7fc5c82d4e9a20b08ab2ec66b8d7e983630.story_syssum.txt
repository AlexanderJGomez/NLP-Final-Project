(CNN) -- A former campaign staffer for San Diego Mayor Bob Filner became the second woman to publicly accuse him of sexual harassment, saying Tuesday that the then-congressman patted her "posterior" while at a fundraising event.
"I had to work and do my job in an atmosphere where women were viewed by Mayor Filner as sexual objects or stupid idiots," Jackson said.
Fink told KPBS on Tuesday that the incident happened as she was escorting Filner from table to table at a fundraising dinner.
"He turned to me and he said, 'Turn around,' " Fink said Tuesday.
"
Her lawyer, Gloria Allred, called on Filner to resign, telling reporters, "Apologies alone will not take care of this injustice."
Jackson said she decided to resign after Filner's deputy chief of staff resigned in June.
Filner "laughed it off," she said.
