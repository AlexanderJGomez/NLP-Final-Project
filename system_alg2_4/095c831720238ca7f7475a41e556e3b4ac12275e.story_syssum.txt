(CNN) -- Ukrainian forces have taken full control of Donetsk airport as they continue to fight pro-Russian rebels in the eastern Ukraine city, a Ukrainian military spokesman says.
A nine-story residential building at the train station area has been damaged.
Still, the train station is working," it said.
The Ukraine government says "terrorists" fired on the plane.
The move unleashed deadly strife that led to Yanukovych's ouster, Russia's annexation of Crimea and a pro-Russian rebellion.
