HAMILTON, Bermuda (CNN) -- The Obama administration's agreement with Bermuda to settle four Uyghurs from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was causing a rift Friday between the United States and its strongest ally, Britain.
The official said, "We feel we should have been consulted" before the deal was struck between the United States and the British "overseas territory."
Bermuda's government said Thursday the four had been resettled in Bermuda.
Bermuda "should have consulted the UK government," he said.
The four were twice cleared for release -- once by the Bush administration and again this year, according to a U.S. Justice Department statement.
The men, who are staying in an apartment, were free to roam about the island.
The Justice Department on Friday said the two detainees from Chad and Iraq were approved for transfer after the Guantanamo Review Task Force looked at their cases.
The issue is controversial because of China's opposition to the Uyghurs being sent to any country but China.
The 17 Uyghurs had left China and made their way to Afghanistan, where they settled in a camp with other Uyghurs opposed to the Chinese government, the Justice Department said in its statement.
They left China because they did not agree with the government, she said.
A senior U.S. administration official said the State Department is working on a final agreement with Palau to settle the matter of the 13 remaining Uyghur detainees.
Palau said it will take in the ethnic Uyghur detainees for humanitarian reasons and because of the "special relationship" between Palau and the United States.
