(CNN) -- Pulitzer Prize-winning author, radio host and activist Studs Terkel died in his Chicago, Illinois, home Friday at the age of 96.
Terkel, known for his portrayal of ordinary people young and old, rich and poor, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1985 for his remembrances of World War II, "The Good War."
"That hotel was far more of an education to me than the University of Chicago was," Studs told CNN in 2000.
"Oral history is having people tell their own stories and bringing it forth.
And that's what I'm interested in."
Who are the storytellers?"
And they're our storytellers."
"It's about life," Terkel said in 2000 when asked about the project.
