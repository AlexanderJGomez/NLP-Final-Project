Soccer star David will take former popstar wife Victoria and their four children back to Europe, with big-spending French club Paris Saint-Germain confirming that the former England captain has passed a medical and signed a short-term deal ahead of Thursday's transfer deadline.
"It's simply a very nice piece of short-term brand alignment that will be mutually beneficial to both parties," sports business expert Simon Chadwick told CNN.
However, one leading football executive who had unsuccessfully tried to persuade Beckham to join his team said that the midfielder still had a strong role to play on and off the pitch.
"I chose Paris because I can see what the club are trying to do.
I can see who the club are trying to bring in," he said Thursday.
"At first it is like the marketing -- you bring in him more for the brand than the player," said former PSG defender Didier Domi, who played in the MLS for New England Revolution in 2011.
He can play a part for PSG in both Ligue 1 and Champions League."
Former AC Milan coach Ancelotti managed Beckham during the former England captain's first loan spell with the Serie A club in 2009.
Beckham is super-ambitious," Arsene Wenger told reporters this week.
He explained that he could not play for another club in England except Manchester United, where he won six Premier League titles and the Champions League before moving to Spain in 2003.
"It's the team I support and the team I dreamed of playing for," said Beckham, who to Manchester as a teenager and progressed through the club's academy.
