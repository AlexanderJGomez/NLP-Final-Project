AUSTIN, Texas (CNN) -- Monday, in the much anticipated New Haven, Connecticut, firefighters' case, the Supreme Court reversed an opinion joined by Judge Sonia Sotomayor, President Obama's Supreme Court nominee.
The reversal was expected and is not the first time an appointee has been reversed by the court he was about to join.
More significantly, after Burger had been confirmed, the Court reversed him again, this time in a major case -- Powell v. McCormack.
When the case reached the Supreme Court, a lengthy opinion by Chief Justice Earl Warren held that courts could rule in such a case and that a House of Congress could only exclude someone if that person did not meet the qualifications, age, citizenship and residence requirements set forth in the Constitution.
Only once in the past 15 years has the Republican majority voted in favor of minorities in an affirmative action case.
That was enough for Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a Republican, who switched from her normal skepticism of affirmative action to sustain the law school program.
Thus just two years ago in cases out of Seattle, Washington, and Louisville, Kentucky, the Republican majority invalidated school assignment plans that the school districts themselves had decided were appropriate to prevent resegregation.
Some Republican senators may try to use the New Haven majority to paint Sotomayor as out of the mainstream.
But that conclusion requires painting the four dissenters as out of the mainstream, too.
