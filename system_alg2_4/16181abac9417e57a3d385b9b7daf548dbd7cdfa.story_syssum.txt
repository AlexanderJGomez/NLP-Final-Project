Just weeks before the tournament kicks off, president Jose Manuel Barroso has rejected an invitation to attend the final in Kiev -- citing concerns over the treatment of imprisoned opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
Officials have denied the allegations.
Neither Ukraine nor Poland have previously hosted such a top-level sports event, which is run by European football's governing body UEFA.
The attacks cast further doubt over Ukraine's's ability to stage such an event, and UEFA has taken the unprecedented step of raising political concerns with the East European nation.
