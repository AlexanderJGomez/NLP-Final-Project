(CNN) -- A NATO delegation arrived Tuesday in southeastern Turkey to survey the Turkish-Syrian border for the possible deployment of Patriot anti-aircraft missile batteries, the semi-official Anadolu news agency reported.
In October, the Turkish government won authorization in parliament for possible cross-border military incursions into Syria after Syrian mortar fire killed five civilians in the Turkish border town of Akcakale.
Turkish and Syrian military forces have also engaged in cross-border artillery duels since the Akcakale incident.
Government forces dropped more than 10 barrel bombs on the Aleppo province city of Deir Hafer, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said.
At least 131 people were killed across Syria on Tuesday, including 48 in Damascus and its suburbs, the LCC said.
More than 70 countries have signed a treaty banning the use of cluster bombs, but Syria is not among them.
In October, the Syrian government said it had not used cluster bombs during the current conflict.
About 40,000 civilians have been killed since the first protests 20 months ago against President Bashar al-Assad's government, according to the opposition Center for Documentation of Violations in Syria.
