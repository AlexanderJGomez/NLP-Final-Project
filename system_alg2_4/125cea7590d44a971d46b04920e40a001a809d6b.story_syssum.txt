London (CNN) -- More than 700 years after William Wallace died fighting for Scottish independence, and more than 300 years after Scotland and England came together in a United Kingdom, a new agreement could lead to an independent Scotland.
A survey released last week by TNS-BMRB showed that only 28% of Scots favor leaving the United Kingdom.
However, only about a third of all the Scots polled wanted to break away from the United Kingdom.
In February, he said he was "100% clear that I will fight with everything I have to keep our United Kingdom together," since an intact United Kingdom, consisting of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, "is stronger, safer, richer and fairer."
