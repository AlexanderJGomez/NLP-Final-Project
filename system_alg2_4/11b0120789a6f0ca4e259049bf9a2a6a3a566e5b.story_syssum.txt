(CNN) -- Hundreds of people were being evacuated from their homes in Missouri after a levee was breached Monday night.
As authorities dealt with rising water in Missouri and Illinois, officials in Oklahoma wrapped up another day of looking for people who remained missing after last week's tornadoes and heavy rain.
At least 18 people died in the storm, authorities said Monday.
Also killed were seven members of an extended family from Guatemala -- including four children -- who died when they were swept away by rains after hiding from the approaching weather in a storm drain.
In eastern Oklahoma County, a 65-year-old man on his way to work was killed early Saturday when he drove off a washed out bridge and drowned in a creek.
The damage wasn't confined to Oklahoma.
No one was killed in that tornado, but three people drowned in Missouri, Nixon said.
Though Friday's tornadoes were not as strong as the EF-5 twister that killed 24 people on May 20, fear drove some people to flee in cars, ignoring warnings not to drive.
Interstates turned into parking lots.
"We saw flooding in areas that we don't see flooding," said police Lt. Jay Barnett.
