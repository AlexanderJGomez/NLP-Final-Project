Researchers at the University of California, San Diego, studied MRI scans of 84 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 175 patients with mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, and 139 images of healthy brains.
More than 50 percent of the brains in the MCI group showed atrophy similar to the Alzheimer's disease patients.
"Although the symptoms for the entire MCI group were primarily memory problems, other parts of the brain were impacted in over half the group," McEvoy said.
The condition of patients in the MCI group whose scans showed minimal signs of atrophy the previous year remained about the same.
The rest of the patients were stable and their symptoms had not increased," McEvoy said.
We can now use this information to create new treatments," he said.
