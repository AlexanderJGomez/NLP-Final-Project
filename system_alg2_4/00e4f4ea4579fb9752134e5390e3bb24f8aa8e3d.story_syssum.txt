In Uganda, sugar is big business.

"(Kakira) started expanding every 10 years, every 20 years, modernizing, acquiring more land, introducing irrigation, expanding the crushing capacity.
It was at this time, however, that history intervened in the shape of one of the 20th century's most brutal rulers.
After almost 50 years, the Madhvanis were no longer welcome in Uganda.
"When Idi Amin told every Asian to leave, they all left the country and went mainly to the UK," Barungi continued, adding that he believes this when Uganda began to economically fall apart.
"Within a few years Kakira Sugar Industries had collapsed, but so had infrastructure in Uganda.
"The factory was a skeleton," Barungi said.
It has grown rapidly over the last 25 years and now produces 18,000 tons of sugar (a year), Barungi said.
Besides nearly 8,000 staff members, Kakira has almost as many contract workers in the shape of farmers, like Mwanja Banuli.
"To be able to sustain business you want agricultural farmers, plantation workers, you want factory workers and the vision of Muljibhai Mudhvani was to develop human resources," Barungi said.
"Before KORD I was just useless," said Beatrice Katende, who has received assistance from the body's programs.
