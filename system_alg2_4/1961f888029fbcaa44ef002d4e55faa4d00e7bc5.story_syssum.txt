(CNN) -- For Gen. Martin Dempsey, Thursday's move to open combat units in the U.S. military to women had its roots nearly a decade ago, on the streets of Baghdad.
And I said, 'Ah, OK,' " Dempsey told reporters at the Pentagon.
Thursday, Dempsey -- now chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff -- sat alongside Defense Secretary Leon Panetta as both men signed a directive that will open front-line posts to the roughly 200,000 women now serving  in the active-duty military.
"If members of our military can meet the qualifications for a job -- and let me be clear, I'm not talking about reducing the qualifications for the job -- if they can meet the qualifications for the job, then they should have the right to serve, regardless of creed or color or gender or sexual orientation," he said.
Dempsey said Thursday's announcement would be implemented "over time and with careful analysis," but he added that the service chiefs were unanimous in their support for the move.
The plaintiffs, who include women awarded Purple Hearts, also say the exclusion places them at a disadvantage for promotion.
"The first two women who earned Silver Stars since World War II, one was a military police sergeant.

" Cone said.
Lilyea, who fought in the 1991 Persian Gulf war, said he believes physical standards will be relaxed "in order to force the acceptance of women in the combat arms specialties."
But Gabbard said there will be women who qualify for combat units under today's standards -- such as a friend of hers from MP school.
The Pentagon must notify Congress of each job or unit as it is sent up to the secretary to be opened to women.
In that case, there were no stipulations attached to openly gay service members.
