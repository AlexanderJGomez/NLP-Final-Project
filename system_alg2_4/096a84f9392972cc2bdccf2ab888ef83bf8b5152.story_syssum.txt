Geely's gambit will be watched to see if it paves the way for other Chinese car manufacturers to crack developed markets.
We sell them as Volvos and we know they are exactly the same in quality no matter where they are produced," he told CNN.
But given that Volvo's brand is staked on its reputation for safety, analysts said the company will have to tread carefully.
Geely chairman Li Shufu said he hoped the company would eventually become a global car brand, but said there were no current plans to begin export its home-grown brand to U.S. showrooms.
Industry analysts say it's unlikely we will see Chinese car makers shake up the U.S. car market in the same way Japanese and South Korean manufacturers did decades earlier, at least in the near future.
