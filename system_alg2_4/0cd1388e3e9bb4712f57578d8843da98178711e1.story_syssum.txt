(CNN) -- For several months now, Filipinos have been treated to the spectacle of yet another impeachment trial aired on national television.
These, they said, weren't listed on his financial disclosures and their total value far exceed his legitimate earnings.
Is the "sturm und drang" of political trials the most effective way of cleansing government?
As president, he vowed to bring Arroyo to trial.
In particular, they see the ombudsman and the chief justice, both Arroyo loyalists, as obstacles to the prosecution not only of the former president but of others they want to hold to account.
If the chief justice is not impeached, then Aquino will have a sworn enemy in the country's highest court.
And the bizarre, and sometimes comic, twists and turns of the chief justice's trial has sucked up the public attention and shifted it away from the systemic reforms that are urgently needed.
In 2009, the World Bank complained about "systemic corruption and bid rigging" in Philippine public works projects.
Political trials can be cathartic.
But they have proven to be a riskier and less effective path for anti-corruption reform.
I don't know that such porousness has since been plugged or that there will be a radical change if the current chief goes.
For too long, Filipinos have been complicit in corruption because that was the only way to get contracts and other benefits from government.
Aquino was elected to office on the hope that he can change all that.
In the end, this path will be the more enduring.
