(CNN) -- Ecuador is calling for British authorities to help investigate after officials found a secret recording device planted inside the South American country's embassy in London.
Patino said authorities have "founded suspicions" that indicate a private British surveillance company was involved, but he did not provide additional details.
In addition to serving as an office for Ecuadorian officials abroad, the embassy has also been home for more than a year to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who received asylum from Ecuador in August and risks arrest if he leaves the property.
Patino said on Wednesday that his country was still evaluating the request.
