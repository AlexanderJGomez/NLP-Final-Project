Federer has played in a record 57 straight grand slam tournaments.
But the 17-time grand slam winner told reporters at the Monte Carlo Masters: "It's a priority for me to be there (at the birth) to support my wife.

Federer said it was too early to say whether he would definitely play at the French Open, which begins on May 25th.
Organizers of the French Open announced that the prize fund has increased by $4m in 2014.
The winners of the men's and women's singles titles will each receive $2.3m, which is a 10% increase on last year's prize pot.
