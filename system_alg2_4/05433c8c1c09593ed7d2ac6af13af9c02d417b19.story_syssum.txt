(CNN) -- The days of memorizing arcane, recondite vocabulary words might be ending for high school students who will take a redesigned SAT in two years.
Multiple-choice questions will contain four answers instead of five.
With 153 questions -- 52 in reading, 44 in writing and language and 57 in math -- the new test will have fewer questions than the current version's 171 questions.
Instead of asking students to take a position on a presented issue, the new version aims to evaluate reading, writing and analytical skills by asking students to produce a written analysis of a provided source text.

Most will be multiple-choice but some will require students to provide answers.
One sample question asks students to read a political speech and determine which lines support the overall argument.
