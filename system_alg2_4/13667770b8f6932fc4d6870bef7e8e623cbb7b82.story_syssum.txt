In a survey of 4,000 people, about a third said they had accidentally sent an e-mail to the wrong person.
"I was shocked!"
She hastily closed the e-mail and tried to erase the image from her mind.
Instead, the e-mail program automatically filled in an entire group from his address book -- something he apparently didn't realize until after he hit the "send" button.

In 2004, Comer met a guy at a concert and went out with him a few times, but ultimately realized she wasn't interested.
She thought she sent the "he's an idiot" e-mail only to her girlfriend.
Unfortunately, Diamond says, she also sent the e-mail to the client -- oops, make that ex-client.
Short of erasing someone's memory, there is no surefire way to retrieve a missent e-mail.
Then there's BigString.com, an e-mail service which lets you tinker with (or even erase) messages that have already been sent by having the sender write e-mails that are created, stored and viewed on a remote server, where they can be edited or revoked at any time; recipients are actually accessing the e-mail on the remote server when they read the message, even though it looks like a regular e-mail.
• Type out the person's full name when addressing your e-mail.
• Immediately notify the person who received the e-mail that it was a mistake and, if possible, ask them not to read the message -- or at least to delete it right away.
