But we have a global sanitation crisis.
Between 1990 and 2008, the share of the world's population that had access to basic sanitation increased only 7%, to 61% of the world's citizens.
Fully half of the hospital beds in the developing world are occupied by people whose ailments can be traced to poor sanitation.
A small but dedicated community that includes governments, NGOs, donors and research institutions is working to expand access to basic sanitation services in developing countries.
One answer may be that the kinds of sanitation facilities offered to developing country households are not terribly appealing.
Efforts to keep sanitation as low-cost as possible may also be part of the problem, at least for some consumers.
In order to turn the tide on the global sanitation crisis, however, efforts are also needed to develop models for low- and no-water sanitation systems at scale, models to which municipal and national governments themselves can aspire.
In the United States, our prevailing urban sanitation model has changed little in the past century, with the typical American flushing more than 12,000 liters of potable water down the sewer every year.
Certainly, most people don't want to talk about poop, much less debate whether and how it might be recycled in their communities.
