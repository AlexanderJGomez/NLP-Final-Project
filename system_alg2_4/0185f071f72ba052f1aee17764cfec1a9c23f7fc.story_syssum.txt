He offered to obtain a kidney for an undercover FBI agent and a confidential witness working for authorities, the criminal complaint says.
The undercover FBI agent told Rosenbaum one of her uncles needed a kidney because he had been on dialysis for two years and on a transplant list at a Philadelphia hospital, the complaint says.
"I'm doing this a long time," the complaint says Rosenbaum told the two agents.
...
Rosenbaum also told the agents he had brokered a transplant two weeks before their meeting, the document says.
The person, a New Jersey-area resident identified in the complaint as Recipient 2, had paid cash for the kidney a little more than a year before the February 2009 call.
The price had gone up to $160,000, he said, because "it's hard to get people," noting that Israel had passed laws prohibiting the sale of human organs, the complaint states.
