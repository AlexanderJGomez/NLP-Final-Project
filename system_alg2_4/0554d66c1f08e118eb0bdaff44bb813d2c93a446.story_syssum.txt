Pumping his mother, brother and two younger sisters with bullets.
But, family members say, Nehemiah Griego is no monster.
The family also said they did not want anyone to use the case in the nation's unfolding debate about guns.
What we do agree on is that those who wish to score political points should not use a confused, misguided, 15-year-old boy to make their case," the family statement said.
That he contemplated killing his girlfriend's parents.
He was arrested Saturday night, after deputies found the bodies of his mother, father, brother and two of his sisters in their home on the outskirts of Albuquerque.
When Griego told Zephania that their mother was dead, the younger boy did not believe him, the document stated.
"Nehemiah stated his brother became upset, so he shot his brother in the head with the same rifle used to kill his mother."
He even sent his girlfriend a picture of his slain mother, Houston said.
Pastor Skip Heitzig said father Greg Griego was also a pastor for a number of years who did prison ministry at the Metropolitan Detention Center and helped to rehabilitate convicts.
His church, Calvary Albuquerque, is scheduled to hold a prayer vigil Wednesday at 7 p.m. for the Griego family.
