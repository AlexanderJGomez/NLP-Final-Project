A California artist is turning people into paintings.
The result is an image that looks like a painting within a photo.
When you look at a photo of one of my installations, you see the painted thing but then you actually see the person coming through it," said the 27-year-old, who lives in Los Angeles.
"A lot of people ask me where I went to art school, but I didn't study art.
"I set up this really comfortable career path for myself ... but I realized I'd always dreamed of being an artist.
She started painting on people by chance.

When Meade first started her career, she didn't have any art shows.
Meade got her big break when a post about her work went viral.
And then all of a sudden overnight it went totally viral.
"Being able to share my story at the TED conference has allowed almost 2 million people now to watch the video and learn about what I do," Meade said.
"When I first started out, it was impossible to get people to model for me," she said.
"It's always a risky thing to go for the improbable," she said.
