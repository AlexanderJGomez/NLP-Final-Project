When my father, an art professor at Florida A&M University, sought to pursue his doctorate in art education at Florida State University, the state of Florida chose to pay his transportation to Penn State rather than open its doors to an African-American graduate student.
Forty-four years later, in 2002, my husband and I left Massachusetts and returned to the South -- initiating our family's reverse migration.
But 60 years after racial segregation was outlawed in schools, public education is again segregating along racial lines.
As school districts move back to "neighborhood school" policies, white students will likely have less school contact with people of color than their parents had.
At most highly segregated white schools, middle-class students are in the majority.
Conversely, academic performance is likely to improve if the student attends a middle-class school, even if his or her own family is poor.
If we remember that the original impetus for the Brown lawsuit was not simply a symbolic fight for the acknowledgment of the equality of all children, but a struggle for equal access to publicly funded educational resources, we can see that the struggle continues.
Children of color in under-resourced, racially isolated schools also need these same tools.
When we can answer that question, the promise of Brown v. Board of Education will be fulfilled.
