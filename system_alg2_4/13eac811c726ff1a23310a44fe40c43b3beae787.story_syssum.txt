British Airways plans to reduce capacity by 4 percent next winter by parking up to 16 aircraft.
This is by far the biggest crisis the industry has ever faced," said Willie Walsh, British Airways' chief executive.
A spokesman for one of Britain's biggest unions said its workers could not afford to work for free for a month.
The airline's premium passenger numbers fell 13 percent in the second half of last year, in line with the industry average.
Total traffic fell 3.4 percent and while the airline carried 33.1 million passengers last year, it was a drop of 4.3 percent from the previous year.
