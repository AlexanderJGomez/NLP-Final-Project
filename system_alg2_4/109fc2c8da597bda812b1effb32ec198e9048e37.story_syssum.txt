Spanish National Police said Friday they have seized hundreds of kilograms of cocaine in an operation that they said thwarted an attempt by Mexican drug dealers allied with the Sinaloa drug cartel to establish a foothold in Europe.
The operation, dubbed "Dark Waters" and carried out in collaboration with the FBI, resulted in the arrests in Madrid of four members of the cartel, which is run by Joaquin Guzman Loera, also known as "El Chapo," police said in a statement.
"They adopted great measures of security to ensure the success of the operations, and sent various containers without any type of drug.
The container, which was intercepted in late July in the Port of Algeciras, concealed 373 kilos of cocaine."
If indeed "Chapo" Guzman's cousin was among the men arrested, "that is a big deal," said Beith, whose books "The Last Narco" and "Hasta El Ultimo Dia," focus on the Mexican drug war.
Beith said Friday's announcement was a testament to the improvement in intelligence sharing by international agencies.
