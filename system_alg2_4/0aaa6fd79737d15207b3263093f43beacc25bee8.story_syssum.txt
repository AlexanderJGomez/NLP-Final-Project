The car dropped 20 feet, and when it settled, Otto's left foot was trapped.
"It collapsed on car.
Firefighter Lorenzo Frediani was running out of time as he struggled to free Otto's foot and get her to safety.
Otto was free.
The quake caused $10 billion in damage, ultimately inspiring California and the rest of the region to re-examine their safety measures for earthquakes.
The fault line, known as the Cascadia Subduction Zone, could one day cause an even larger quake.
Oregon is not prepared for a megaquake, and few areas are, Madin says.
Before 1974, there were no specific building requirements in Oregon to make sure structures were built to withstand major quakes, and design codes have only been adequate for the megaquake since 1993, so many structures are not designed to resist such a large earthquake, Madin says.
It is these factors that led the Oregon Resilience Plan to conclude that in a worst-case scenario, 10,000 people could be killed, and large areas of Oregon could be without transportation, electricity, water and sewer for several months to several years.
Using historic data, scientists like Dr. Chris Goldfinger, a marine geologist and professor at Oregon State University, can forecast the probability of another great quake.
For the south end of the Cascadia, there is roughly a 35-40% probability of having a major quake in the next 50 years.
Even if there is still plenty of time before the next big quake, much work has to be done to make sure Oregon is ready.
