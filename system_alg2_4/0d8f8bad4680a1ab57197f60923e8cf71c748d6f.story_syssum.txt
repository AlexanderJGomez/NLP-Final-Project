In some cases U.S. military engagements in Africa have already caused further instability rather than reducing the risks for international peace and security?
A second U.S. military operation by Navy Seals in Somalia was aimed at capturing Islamist militant leader said to be Mukhtar Abu Zubayr, who also goes by Ahmed Abdi Godane, the leader of Al-Shabaab, the group that claimed responsibility for last month's attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya.
The Somalia operation is a reminder of how technically difficult such operations are and how accurate U.S. intelligence needs to be.
