(CNN) -- Two of the four survivors of this week's crash on an Alaska mountainside were well enough to talk with government officials looking into the cause of the crash, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chairwoman Deborah Hersman told reporters on Friday.
The family of experienced pilot Terry Smith, who was killed in the accident, released a statement Friday saying, "This is a time of great sorrow for our family.
Those killed in the crash could not have been saved even if rescue teams had arrived at the site immediately, officials said.
Raven also found that the injuries were not survivable, he said.

"Despite suffering serious injuries that have required surgery, Kevin is also showing dramatic improvement," the statement said.
Survivor Jim Moorhard remained in fair condition, while William Phillips, whose father died in the crash, remained in good condition, said the Providence Alaska Medical Center.
Investigators are also working to examine the wreckage of the plane.
