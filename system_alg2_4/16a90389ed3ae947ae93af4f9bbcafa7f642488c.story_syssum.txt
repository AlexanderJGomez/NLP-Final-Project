The Launch Pad Tour, introduced in July, is one of three new rare-access tours being offered this year to celebrate Kennedy Space Center's 50th anniversary.
In addition to getting an up-close look at the launchpad, visitors can also tour the Vehicle Assembly Building and the Launch Control Center with a space expert guide.
Later the space shuttle program used the assembly building to attach the shuttles to a large orange external fuel tank and two white rockets used during launch.
As an added bonus, the shuttle Atlantis is parked inside the Vehicle Assembly Building just behind a fence only 25 feet away -- for now.
NASA says Atlantis will be moved to a shuttle hanger on August 16 -- switching places with shuttle Endeavour, which will remain inside the assembly building until mid-September when it will be transported to the California Science Center in Los Angeles for permanent public display.
Control center tours visit Firing Room 4, where Apollo and shuttle managers directed launches.
It's not just one person who launches a space shuttle," said tour guide Rob English, pointing to a photo of the launch room that describes how the team works together.
Next to work spaces for the launch director and the public affairs officer are large windows overlooking the launchpad.
"Finally getting to see all the things that I told the kids about and my own children about for 50 years ... it's amazing," said Jackson.
It's wonderful," said Steinhoff.
Each of the three tours costs an additional $25 for adults and $19 for children ages 3 to 11 beyond the entrance fee to the Kennedy Space Visitor Center, which is $45 for adults and $35 for children.
