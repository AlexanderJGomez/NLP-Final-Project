In our solar system, only three planets lie in the sun's habitable zone -- Venus, Earth and Mars.
Say hello to the three new exoplanets: Kepler 62e and Kepler 62f orbit are the fifth and sixth planets orbiting the star Kepler 62, and Kepler 69c is the third planet orbiting -- you guessed it -- Kepler 69.
We do not know what Kepler 62f is made of but other exoplanets of a similar size are known to be rocky, so that's the best guess for now.
Kepler 62e is about 60% larger than the Earth and is probably hotter because it lies at the inner edge of the habitable zone, in a 122-day orbit -- slightly longer than Mercury's 88-day orbit.
Since Kepler 62 is a cooler star than our sun, planets can orbit closer to it than the Earth can to our sun before overheating.
In contrast, the third Earth-like planet, Kepler 69c, orbits a star very similar to our sun (that is, hotter than Kepler 62).
We don't know for sure whether there is life on Venus or Mars.
But could there be intelligent life in another planetary system, in orbit around one of the 100 billion other stars in our Milky Way galaxy?
The Kepler satellite was designed to look for planets around each of about 100,000 stars.
We have had the technology to explore space and to communicate over long distances for less than 100 years -- a tiny fraction of the few million years since the first humans, much less the 4.5 billion years since the Earth formed.
So it is likely that any other technologically sophisticated civilization would be far more advanced than we.
It is only a matter of time before we know if the galaxy is home to a multitude of planets like Earth, or if we are a rarity."
He asked whether life might exist on one of these planets, and whether we could visit them.
Thanks to Kepler, NASA, dedicated scientists and curious citizens, we are that much closer to finding out.
