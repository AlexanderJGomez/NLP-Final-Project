Washington (CNN) -- Mitt Romney on Tuesday didn't back away from remarks he made in a secretly recorded video casting supporters of President Barack Obama as dependent on welfare, and instead said the comments that generated more problems for him in a tight race were an honest reflection of his campaign's message.
"The president's view is one of larger government," Romney said.
I think a society based upon a government centered nation where government plays a larger and larger role, redistributes money, that's the wrong course for America, that will not build a stronger America, or help people out of poverty."
"There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what," Romney says in one clip first posted on Monday afternoon.
The fund-raiser video was the latest in what has been a shaky stretch for the Romney campaign following last month's political conventions and as the candidates hurtle toward three presidential debates next month.
Obama was caught in a secret camera moment in 2008, when he was recorded at a private fund-raiser saying that some voters "cling to their guns and religion."
The latest flap also bled into other races, including two contests viewed as crucial for Republican hopes of taking control of the Senate.
Too many people today who want to work are being forced into public assistance for lack of jobs," Brown said.
A CNN-ORC poll conducted after the Democratic convention showed Obama with a 52%-46% lead over Romney after the two were tied at 48% in the same poll the previous week.
"I'm torn by two perspectives in this regard," Romney is shown saying.
