Pam Biggers disappeared while on a business trip to the Florida Panhandle in January 2008.
"It's completely baffling," said her husband, Don Biggers.
"All of her belongings, clothes, purse, cell phone, were left in her room."
"We think she may have initially wandered off on her own," Don Biggers said.
Biggers said he was concerned about his wife's health and urged her to not go on the business trip.
The group conducted ground and air searches and used cadaver dogs but was unable to find any clues.
Police and the Biggers family are asking the public for help.
Biggers was last seen wearing a white sweater, black pants with white pinstripes, a wedding band and an aquamarine ring.
