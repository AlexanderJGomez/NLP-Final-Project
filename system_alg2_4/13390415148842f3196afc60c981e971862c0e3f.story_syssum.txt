Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The failed computer system that caused flight delays across the country has been restored, the Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday.
Due to the outage, air traffic controllers had to enter flight plans manually, a problem that causes delays, according to the FAA and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.
McDonald said she thought her Spirit Airlines flight would leave on time around 7 a.m.
AirTran Airways spokesman Christopher White said the airline had canceled 22 flights around the country as of 8 a.m.
Delta Air Lines spokeswoman Susan Elliott said the airline was not providing numbers on how many flights were affected.
The longest delays have been a little more than an hour, but no flights have been canceled, and some might be consolidated, he said.
All passengers are encouraged to contact the airlines regarding the statuses of their flights before they head to the airport," the airport said.
At Indianapolis International Airport, most morning flights left on time with little impact from the computer glitch, but inbound flights from large hubs are expected to be delayed Thursday and possibly into Friday, said spokeswoman Susan Sullivan.
The air traffic controllers said "weather equipment was affected" and information such as winds speeds was not "processing."
