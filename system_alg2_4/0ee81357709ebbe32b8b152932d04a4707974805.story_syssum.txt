Gard is one of the organizers of "Occupy Melbourne," a group that started on Facebook that now has more than 2,000 members with plans to protest on October 15 in City Square.
Gard and the planned Australian spin-offs of "Occupy Wall Street" are not alone.
Protest pages in Spain and Italy -- two countries hard hit by the financial crisis and subsequent European Union debt woes -- have the largest Facebook attendees so far, with 42,410 and 20,568, respectively.
Bankers have got off scot-free whilst the people of this country are being punished for a crisis they did not create," said the group's Facebook invite page.
"What we have in common is that we are the other 99%, that we want people over profit, that we are making our voices heard against greed and corruption and for a democratic and just society," London organizer James Alexander Fancourt told the Telegraph newspaper.
"Look, Australia's not the worst place in the world, but we're seeing banks recording record profits, rental has been crazy, housing prices are going up and up," Gar said.
