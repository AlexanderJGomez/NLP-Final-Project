The brother of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri is proposing to mediate a peace deal between the West and Islamists.
Mohamed spent 14 years in Egyptian jail on charges including terrorism and involvement in the 1981 assassination of President Anwar Sadat 1981.
He wants peace, he says, between Muslims and non-Muslims and has written a proposal that outlines the terms.
He says he's offering to be an intermediary between Islamists and the United States and the West.
His six-page proposal offers a 10-year truce if the following terms are met.
Through his steely determination to get his voice heard and his message out it is hard to gauge how much hope al-Zawahiri is really investing in his initiative.
Then came his came his arrest, long before 9/11, picked up, he says, by Egyptian authorities in the United Arab Emirates.
I hope this opportunity today is not wasted."
He says his brother will listen to him, but admits he hasn't talked to him in long over a decade.
It wouldn't be the first time the terms are unacceptably high.
