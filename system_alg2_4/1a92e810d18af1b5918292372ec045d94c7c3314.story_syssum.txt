Léogâne, Haiti (CNN)  -- Joanie Yestin walks through a small alleyway to what used to be home, now a pile of concrete and crushed belongings.
A block had fallen on him.
Yestin, like many of Haiti's almost 10,000 Boys and Girls Scouts, decided to contribute her share to the earthquake relief effort.
The Scouts have one other advantage: They are young.
"It is important to involve young people right from the start," Perez said.
Yestin and her friends broke out in a song about being together; it was the only way to get through life's tribulations.
By night, they sleep under the stars.
"It was God's will" that her father died, she had said earlier.
"Up until now, I haven't really had the opportunity to help others."
She had wanted to attend university, study communications.
"I love the way we work together," she said of the Scouts.
