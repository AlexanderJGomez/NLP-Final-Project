Mueller was arrested in Aspen, Colorado, on December 3 and charged with assault and cocaine possession, police said.
Mueller, 34, checked into the rehab facility before the announcement was made, he said.
The incidents in Aspen began when a woman at the Belly Up -- a bar and performance venue there -- complained that Mueller had been "the aggressor" in an assault, Aspen police said.
But she is more widely known as the ex-wife of Sheen.
The revelations led to a court order removing the 2-year-old boys from Sheen's home.
She was in substance abuse rehab earlier in 2010 "to get her health in order," Galanter said at the time.
