Baghdad (CNN) -- Some Christians in Iraq's capital were considering leaving, following a wave of bombings targeting members of their religion that left two dead and 16 others wounded.
There were two explosions in the east, in New Baghdad; two in Yarmouk; six in the central Baghdad district of Karrada; two in the southern region of Dora; and one each in al-Saydia and Al-Ameriya, the official said.
The violence has prompted a "slow but steady exodus" of thousands of Christians from Baghdad and Mosul, the U.N. refugee agency said recently.
"We have heard many accounts of people fleeing their homes after receiving direct threats.
Many Christians in Iraq said they toned down their Christmas celebrations this year because of threats by militants in recent weeks.
