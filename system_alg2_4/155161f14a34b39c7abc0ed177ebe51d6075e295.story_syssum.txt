(CNN) -- A 21-year-old woman whose body was found in a water tank of a Los Angeles hotel in February was the victim of an accidental drowning, medical examiners reported Thursday.
Lam checked into the Cecil Hotel on January 26, on her way to Santa Cruz, California, according to police in her hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia.
Clad in a red hoodie, Lam at one point walks out of the elevator before returning to it, pushing the buttons again.
Strange things began happening with the hotel's water supply later in the month, according to Sabina and Michael Baugh, a British couple who spent eight days there.
The tap water "tasted horrible," Baugh said.
"We never thought anything of it," she said.
