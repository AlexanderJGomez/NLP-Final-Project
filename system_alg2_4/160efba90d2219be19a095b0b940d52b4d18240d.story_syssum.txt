NEW YORK (CNN) -- The missing engine from a US Airways jet that ditched in the Hudson River was recovered Friday, more than a week after the crash landing.

Investigators said this week that they found a single feather and evidence of "soft-body impact damage" on the aircraft.
Meanwhile, a pilot program involving "birdstrike avoidance" radar systems will be expanded to include LaGuardia, said a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
Newly released video captured seconds after the Airbus A320 ditched in the Hudson River showed passengers trying to flee the aircraft almost immediately after it settled in the water and began to float along the river current.
The video, which the Con Edison utility company released Thursday, first shows a long wake behind the plane before zooming in on the aircraft.
Passengers run onto the plane's other wing as the aircraft floats off-screen for a few seconds.
The camera jerks, and when the plane reappears, passengers can be seen at the bottom of the inflatable ramp.
A person manning the camera from inside the plant saw the plane hit the water and redirected the camera, Olert said.
