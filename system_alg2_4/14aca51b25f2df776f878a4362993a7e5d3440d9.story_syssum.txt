The news came only hours after her husband, Pyotr Verzilov, told CNN that his wife had gone back on a hunger strike to protest being returned to Penal Colony No.
But on September 23, she declared the conditions at the prison camp to be intolerable and began a hunger strike.
Verzilov warned then that Tolokonnikova would resume her hunger strike if she was sent back to Penal Colony No.
Tolokonnikova wrote that her life was once threatened and other prisoners tell her she is not beaten only because of the celebrity her case has brought her.
Maria Alyokhina, another convicted member of Pussy Riot, went on a hunger strike earlier this year, protesting conditions in a different remote prison camp.
