This week, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission held a scheduled two-day public hearing on a nuclear power plant near Victoria.
Those who support the plant repeatedly stated, "Nuclear power is a safe energy source" at the two-day hearing.
And that's exactly what rancher David Huber is afraid of -- a larger Victoria with a nuclear power plant.
Huber, a 6-foot-2 rancher with a thick Texas accent and an affable personality, said he loves his land and his way of life.
Prior to choosing the location, Exelon Generation studied the possible impact of a nuclear power plant on Victoria's community, water and ecology.
"Nuclear power is a high risk, high stakes business," said Jim Blackburn with Texans for Sound Energy Policy at this week's NRC public hearing.
No new nuclear plant has won final approval in the United States since the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, although site work is being done at a couple of locations around the country.
The situation in Japan doesn't seem to have any effect on those who steadfastly support the proposed nuclear plant near Victoria, Pozzi said.
"I don't expect people will change their minds," he said.
"There's going to be nuclear power."
Blackburn and his Texans for Sound Energy Policy group fears the ground beneath the proposed nuclear site could sink, causing the cooling water ponds, vital to a nuclear plant, to drain away.
Blackburn said Exelon has not addressed the growth fault issue in its filings with the NRC.
He did say all safety structures including vital safety cooling ponds would be located away from the growth faults.
"We did find it and studied it," said Frantz.
"(What if) all of a sudden that (proposed) plant has a problem and there's an evacuation for a 10-mile radius?"
What do I do?
he asked, as he stood on the banks of the San Antonio River next to his ranch at sunset.
