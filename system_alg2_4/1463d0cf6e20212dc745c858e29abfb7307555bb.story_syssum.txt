Branson also announced that Virgin Galactic, his fledgling commercial space company, was expanding to include a satellite-launching service that would use a low-cost rocket system to propel payloads into orbit.
Some 529 would-be astronauts, including celebrities such as Ashton Kutcher, have so far signed up for $200,000-a-seat flights which will last two hours.
Branson acknowledged the existing price tag means that his goal of opening space travel up to ordinary people was some way off.
"The initial flights will be sub-orbital, which will give people a taste of space," he said.
Virgin Galactic's commercial director Stephen Attenborough told CNN that the goal was to be able to offer a reliable satellite launch system for $10 million, a price tag he says undercuts existing services by up to 50%.
But Branson insisted his chief aim was to open space to researchers studying the "global crisis" of climate change.
"Some people will want to focus their time looking out of the vehicle, looking down at the planet or Milky Way, whereas others may want to do spins or tricks," Whitesides told CNN.
My guess is it will be as simple as saying 'OK everybody; get back in your seats.
Adam Wells, Virgin Galactic's head of design, said the cabin's interior was being kept as minimal as possible to reduce weight and maximize space for floating.
"From an ideal standpoint we want everything, including the seats to disappear, which is a fascinating design challenge."
Araujo, 62, described his journey into space as a "spiritual journey" during which he would pay homage to his late father, a poet and composer also called Angelo Araujo.
He will be the first Portuguese poet to be read in space.
"If it's successful, it will eventually become much more common and whatever record I set will quickly be broken."
