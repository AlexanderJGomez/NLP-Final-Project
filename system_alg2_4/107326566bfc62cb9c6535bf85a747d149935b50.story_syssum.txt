The ousted President was convicted on charges of violence and inciting violence and sentenced to 20 years in prison for the torture of protesters outside the presidential palace in December 2012.
All 14 co-defendants were also convicted of violence and inciting violence, and all were also acquitted of murder.
"Coup leaders have sentenced Mohamed Morsi to decades in prison for nothing more than championing the democratic will of the people."
Hoda Nasrallah, a lawyer representing two torture victims, called the outcome of the case typical for Egypt.
We wish we could see the trial of a regime when it is in power, not after that."
Nasrallah called for a "fair trial," criticizing the fact that seven men killed during the December 2012 clashes were not included in this case, because they were affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood, and that the involvement of other sides, including police, wasn't investigated.
At various points in the trial, Morsy said that he was still the President of Egypt and refused to recognize the court as legal.
"Before the case reached the court, it was dominated by politics more than the law, and I said this in my argument at the court.
Early in the trial, Morsy and his co-defendants were held in a metal cage in court.
He is also standing trial in three other cases, including two on charges of espionage.
