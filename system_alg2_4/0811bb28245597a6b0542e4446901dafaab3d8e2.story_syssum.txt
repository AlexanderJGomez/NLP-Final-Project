BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Their faces and darker skins make them look different.
"We told our people, Inshalla, God willing, Obama is going to win, and if he wins, it will be a victory for all black people in the world," he recalls.
When news broke that Obama had won the election, it was early in the morning of November 5 in Basra -- but Thijeel excitedly called a fellow member of his political party.
Thijeel's organization estimates there are approximately 2 million black Iraqis.
Many Iraqis still call blacks "abed," an Arabic word that means "slave."
Many white Iraqis claim the word isn't meant to offend, but Thijeel says they have no idea how hurtful it is.
In Basra, many black Iraqis have menial jobs.
The movement also wants laws to combat racial discrimination.
Some white Iraqis say that founding a political party on racial lines is divisive, especially when Iraqis of different communities need to pull together.
But Thijeel, quoting Barack Obama, says it's time for change.
