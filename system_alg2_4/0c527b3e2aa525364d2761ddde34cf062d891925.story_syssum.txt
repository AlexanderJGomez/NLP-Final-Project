(CNN) -- A Jewish hockey player sued the National Hockey League's Anaheim Ducks on Tuesday, claiming that coaches of one of its affiliate teams subjected him to harassment and anti-Semitic remarks.
"
The Ducks tried to send him to the Central Hockey League, but when he claimed the move would be a breach of his contract, the team backed down and suspended Raymond and Pederson briefly and told them to write apology letters, the lawsuit states.
He wrote that he no longer would continue the behavior, according to the lawsuit.
"The Ottawa Senators Hockey Club does not comment on legal matters regarding members of its organization and those under contract," said Phil Legault, vice president for communications.
