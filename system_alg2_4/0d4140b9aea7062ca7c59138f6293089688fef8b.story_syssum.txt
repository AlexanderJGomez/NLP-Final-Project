(CNN) -- Growing up, Alli Webb always loved having her hair done, and after having children of her own she decided to bring that happy feeling to millions of women worldwide in an instant with her booming business, Drybar.
With over 2,000 stylists I can't do it myself anymore but I train a team that does it so I'll do a lot of demos for them too, which I love, to get my hands back in hair because I have such a strong passion for hair.
W: We have so many, like "life is too short to be somewhere lame," "pretty is as pretty does," I heard that my whole life growing up.
Being yourself is one of them, we want our stylists to feel really empowered to be who they are.
I like to pop in unannounced and make sure everything is running smoothly but it just kind of depends on the day.
I do work in the office a lot too because we have so much going on there but I really try to get out in the field and make surprise visits just so I can see what's going on, stay connected, get a blowout, whatever.
I've always had long thick curly hair and people when you typically walk into salons they say well for you it's gonna be $60 but for your friend it's $50 and it felt so discriminatory towards me and I wanted women to feel like there's no bait and switch, it was $40 no matter how long your hair is, if we curl it, flat iron it it's always gonna be $40.
It's all a part of making it an experience and a fun place to hang out.
