WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney said Monday that he does not believe Saddam Hussein was involved in the planning or execution of the September 11, 2001, attacks.
Cheney restated his claim that "there was a relationship between al Qaeda and Iraq that stretched back 10 years.
That was the judgment of our [intelligence community] and State Department."
The evidence is overwhelming," Cheney said at the time.
On Monday, though, Cheney identified former CIA Director George Tenet as the "prime source of information" on the relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda.
Among other things Monday, Cheney also called the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center a "good facility ... if you are going to be engaged in a world conflict, such as we are, in terms of global war on terrorism.
Since Obama has already released memos detailing the interrogation methods, Cheney said, it is important to share the results of those interrogations with the public as well.
...
Cheney said Monday that the memos previously released also were the subject of ongoing lawsuits.
He has said that the interrogations saved the lives of "thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands."
