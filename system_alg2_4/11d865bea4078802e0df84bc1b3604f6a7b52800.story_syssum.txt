(CNN) -- The father of Malala Yousafzai, the teenager whom the Taliban tried to kill, has been given a job in a Pakistan consulate in Birmingham, England, where she is recovering from gunshot wounds to her head and neck, Pakistani officials said Wednesday.
Malala was shot by gunmen last fall for her crusade about girls going to school.
On October 9, Malala was on a school van in Swat Valley when Taliban gunmen stopped the vehicle and demanded that other girls tell them who was Malala.
"We do not tolerate people like Malala speaking against us," a Taliban spokesman said after the shooting.
A bullet that hit her left brow didn't penetrate the skull but traveled the side of her head under the skin and into her neck, the hospital said.
The shock wave shattered the thinnest bone of her skull, and fragments entered her brain, the hospital said.
Girls were afraid that attending the Malala Yousafzai Post Graduate College for Women in the Taliban-dominated Swat Valley would attract the attention of fighters such as the ones who shot Malala and the two other girls, said Kamran Rehman Khan, a top official in the Swat Valley.
Khan told CNN that Malala called him last month from her hospital room in England and asked the school to remove her name.
