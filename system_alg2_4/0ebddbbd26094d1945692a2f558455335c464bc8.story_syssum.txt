That now depends on whether these parties can translate their momentum into seats in their national parties.
In Greece, Syriza should not even be called a fringe party, though they do occupy a space in the European parliament on the far left.
Both Labour and the ruling Conservatives have for the past few years had to defend their policies on Europe and immigration.
But unlike many other fringe parties in Europe, UKIP does not have one single seat in Westminster, the national parliament.
This reminds me of five years ago when the "Rise of the Right" in Europe was the screaming headline after the last EU Parliament election.
UKIP has gone from 16% to 27%.
It should also be noted that the far, far right British party, the BNP, lost both of their MEPs and will have none in the new parliament.
Now, it will be up to the centrist parties, in the European Parliament and in national parliaments to cobble together coalitions if they want to thwart the rise of fringe parties.
You may or may not support these party's views, but they are tapping into a growing resentment in Europe.
