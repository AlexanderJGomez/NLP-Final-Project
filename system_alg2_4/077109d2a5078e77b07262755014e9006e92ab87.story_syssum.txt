This is how it rolls at the Marathon du Medoc, an annual festival of wine and running near Bordeaux, France, in which competitors strive to complete 26 miles and almost as many glasses of the local vin.
Now in its 30th edition, the race is something of a legend for marathon runners.
To compare, the 2013 Paris marathon had an average speed of four hours and 10 minutes.
As if it's not enough that we're all drinking, the marathon is themed each year, with nearly every participant dressed in costumes.
Polish national Hanna Gierzynska-Zalewska, a Medoc Marathon connoisseur, will run it for the third time this year.
"Wine, food along the course would be hard to resist and I have no idea how my body will react," he says.
My time of six hours and nine minutes wasn't going to break any records, but I thoroughly enjoyed every glass of wine offered along the way.
Amy Carlson traveled from Minnesota to do the marathon in 2013 -- her first ever despite a distaste for running.
