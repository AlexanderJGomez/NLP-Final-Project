ALS has no survivors.
The average life expectancy is two to five years.
I have what is called familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
My mother, Catherine, was diagnosed when I was in high school and has been living with this disease for 13 years.
I was fulfilling two passions:  photographing 40+ weddings a year and spending much needed quality time with my mom.
I was carrying camera equipment all day, and it became increasingly more difficult to change settings and hold up my camera.
That day, hands down, was the most difficult day of my entire life.
I cried uncontrollably in the doctor's office.
Since then I've lost the ability to button my clothes and open bottles.
I feel like I have weights strapped to my body.
I believe this is one of the reasons many people didn't really know what ALS was all about before the ice bucket challenge:  No one wanted to talk about a depressing disease with no cure, no hope.
But now ALS is finally out of the closet after the ice bucket challenge sensation this summer!
One voice can and will make a difference.
I'm grateful I've found the love of my life.
I just want to spend as much time as I can with her.
