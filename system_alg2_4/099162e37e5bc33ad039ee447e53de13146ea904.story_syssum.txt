"What we're seeing here is evidence of, I think, some calculation and deliberation," he said.
By Saturday evening, police said that "all hazards" had been removed from the suspect's apartment.
All occupants except those who live in the suspect's building were allowed to return home Saturday night, police said.
"There's a lot of hurt.
Police Chief Oates said he hoped his officers would be out of the theater by Monday to allow the suspect's defense team in there Tuesday.
But Holmes soon went out a rear door leading from the theater to the parking lot, leaving it propped open, the source said.
He was back inside the theater a few minutes after the movie had begun and was dressed head-to-toe in black, authorities said.
Police said Holmes set off two gas-emitting devices before spraying the theater with bullets from an AR-15 rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun and at least one of two .40-caliber handguns that police recovered.
"You're sitting in a movie theater trying to watch a movie with your friends.
Holmes had bought the guns legally at stores in the Denver area over the past two months, Oates said.

Holmes, who is being held in Arapahoe County Jail, is scheduled to appear in court on Monday morning.
