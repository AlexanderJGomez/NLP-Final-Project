But he said there is no sign that dispersants are remaining in the water or settling to the bottom, and that the Corexit 9500 being used by oil company BP is among the least toxic to small fish and mysid shrimp of the eight products tested, Anastas said.
But a New Orleans-based environmental group is expressing qualms about the dispersant and the massive amounts being dumped in  the Gulf.
"We're very concerned that BP is using a product that they know that they have on hand, and that they're not really being challenged to use better products."
The government's Deepwater Horizon Response website reported earlier this week that more than 1.5 million gallons of dispersants have been used in the battle against the oil spill.
It initially tried to force BP to use another dispersant on the spill, but the company said no safer products were available in large enough quantities.
