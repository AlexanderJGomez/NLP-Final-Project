But with expectations beyond high for Google to swoop in and save the day from Apple's unreliable, problematic maps app -- which replaced the existing Google Maps app in September with the rollout of the new iOS 6 software -- many just hoped Google's version would live up to promises of being a superior mapping platform for the iPhone.
The good news, however, is that the Google Maps app is excellent.
Google Maps has years of experience perfecting data accuracy and the latest app shows it.
Apple Maps was slammed for accuracy issues right out of the gate in September.
A perk for both platforms: voice-assistant Siri can help users out with directions via Apple Maps, while Google's platform also features voice guided turn-by-turn navigation.
One of the biggest gripes about Apple Maps was that it didn't come with public transportation directions.
Although Google Maps incorporates 2D and 3D views via Street View, as well as the rotating and tilting of maps with gestures inside the app, we still prefer Apple's design.
Google Maps has made a poignant effort to become a destination spot on the iPhone.
As a bonus for developers -- and app users alike -- Google announced Google Maps SDK for iOS, which gives app developers the opportunity to use maps within apps for the iPod Touch, iPhone and iPad.
