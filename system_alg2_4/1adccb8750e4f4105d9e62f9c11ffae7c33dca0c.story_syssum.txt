Cicciaro died that night, and White was arrested.
He is charged with second-degree manslaughter.
The night Cicciaro was killed, he was at a party with the girl when they spotted Aaron White.
Aaron White says he then went home and received more calls from Cicciaro and his friends, telling him they were coming to his house to kill him.
Then, police say, John White shot Cicciaro at point-blank range.
But the rape threat that sparked the confrontation between Daniel Cicciaro and Aaron White was not real.
"The thing is, that night, Daniel believed Aaron threatened to rape a girl that was like his little sister," Cicciaro said.
White's attorneys say that racism lies at the heart of the confrontation and that John White feared Cicciaro and his friends were going to kill his son.
"The Whites, none of them, ever called 9-1-1, even after he shot Daniel, but he did call their attorney," Joanne Cicciaro added.
"I saw his blank eyes open, staring at the ceiling."
