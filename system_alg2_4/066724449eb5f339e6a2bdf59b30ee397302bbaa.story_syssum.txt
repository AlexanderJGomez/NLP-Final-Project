(CNN)Looking only at the historic, social and political facts, you will miss the spiritual phenomenon that enabled us to come together to change the South and the nation in 1965.
This is Selma the movement and "Selma" the movie.
The opening scenes of "Selma" shocked me into a spiritual realm with the sudden explosion in the midst of four beautiful, laughing little girls in Sunday school at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama.
The movie "Selma" has been years in the making.
When you see "Selma" for yourself -- and you must -- look for the miraculous transformation of America.
"Selma" is a cinematic tribute to the democratic vision that we can live together in freedom without violence.
