Scientists at the UK's University of Manchester say they have demonstrated how graphene -- a two-dimensional material made from a single layer of carbon atoms -- could look inside electronic circuits of the future.
Graphene is also the strongest (200 times stronger than steel), the most flexible and the most conductive material in the world -- which makes it an attractive alternative to the silicon chip.
The discovery of graphene was made at the university in 2004 by Russian physicists Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, who received the Nobel prize for physics for their work in 2010.
Commenting on the new research, Geim said: "Graphene encapsulated within boron nitride offers the best and most advanced platform for future graphene electronics.
"We are constantly looking at new ways of demonstrating and improving the remarkable properties of graphene," Geim said.
Researchers at Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul, South Korea have already demonstrated a flexible touchscreen, he says.
It turned out to be untrue, but bendable phones, computers and televisions may not be far off, says Ferrari.
