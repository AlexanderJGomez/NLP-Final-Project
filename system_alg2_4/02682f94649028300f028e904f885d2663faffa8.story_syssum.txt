(CNN) -- For Connor Hays, nothing said summer more than spending a day at Joyland Amusement Park.
But he couldn't.
Within the confines of Joyland, Hays was hit with a rush of memories from his youth.
Those deep feelings of nostalgia associated with places like local, homegrown theme parks are quite common, according to Jim Futrell, a historian with the National Amusement Park Historical Association.

It's what brought her and her family to the gates of Land of Oz, a relic theme park, sitting all alone on top of Beech Mountain in North Carolina.
She and her family visited the park in late May and found that the gates to the theme park were open, so they stepped inside.
"I don't think you are supposed to walk in the way we did," she said.
Land of Oz may seem like an abandoned theme park, but it's actually not.
But the space went through a revival in the 1990s, according to Cynthia Keller, the property manager of Land of Oz and self-appointed "Keeper of Oz."
"You get the grounds to yourself, and you can stroll the yellow brick road," Keller said.
"We aren't crazy about 'The Wizard of Oz,' but I definitely had some nostalgia walking through," Georgia said.
"There is something about local amusement parks," he said.
