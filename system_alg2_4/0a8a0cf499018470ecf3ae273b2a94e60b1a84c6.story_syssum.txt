In recent interviews with about a half-dozen prominent evangelicals, no one listed opposition to gay marriage as their top priority.
Jim Daly, the president of Focus on the Family, said in an interview with CNN.
Evangelicals are an influential bloc of the party and if the community eases its opposition to same-sex marriage, that could make it easier for candidates to do the same.
Of course, there's still plenty of opposition to same-sex marriage among Republicans.
One of those friends is Ted Trimpa, a prominent gay activist and Democratic strategist.
"With Jim, it's a new day," Trimpa said.
"There's definitely a coming divide between evangelicals, but it's not public yet," Vines said.
GOP leaders are eyeing those polls closely and in the last two years, four Republican senators have announced their support for same-sex marriage.
Some, like Republican strategist and LGBT activist Margaret Hoover, say the party is changing too slowly and needs to put its opposition to gay marriage to rest.
Even I couldn't have imagined that," Hoover said.
