Harry Weeks, left, and Jason McCuiston fired on James von Brunn at the Holocaust Memorial Museum.
What went terribly wrong is that white supremacist James von Brunn allegedly walked into the museum and started firing his rifle, shooting security officer Stephen Johns in the chest.
"This was terrible," Weeks said softly.
"First thing I thought about, I have an 11-year-old," the officer said before breaking down.
The security officers said they believe von Brunn will survive his wounds and eventually face trial.
McCuiston said the 6-foot-6-inch, 300-pound Johns was a "gentle giant" who was always friendly to colleagues and museum visitors.
Weeks said he wanted the world to see "what a man of hate did to this family, and the grief he caused.
"
"Time will hopefully heal all, and hopefully there will be a little bit of closure with us and the family and we can all just move forward but never forget what a wonderful man he was."
