(CNN) -- One Australian gold prospector has hit pay dirt.
The 47-year resident of Ballarat says that gold has been continuously found in the region since 1851, but technology has recently become an essential aid for modern prospectors.
Shmith expects collectors may already be eyeing a potential purchase of the Ballarat nugget because of its rarity.
A nice, small nugget would already sell for 10% to 15% above its weight in gold."
Other prospectors - old and new - will hope that they will be as lucky.
