Leslie Waffen, 67, of Rockville, Maryland, pleaded guilty in October to an eight-year scheme to embezzle historic recordings donated to the government in order to peddle them on eBay.
The government said 4,806 of those items were taken from the National Archives.
Waffen worked at the National Archives from 1969 until June 2010.
That former radio engineer, J. David Goldin, told the Washington Post he saw the listing for the Babe Ruth hunting recording when he was searching the Internet in September 2010.
Goldin, a radio historian and collector, assisted law enforcement in its investigation of the stolen recordings.
