At the far end of a long driveway lies a colossal complex and one single word that has come to define Anren: museums.
Liu and his family emerged as prominent local residents in the 1930.
Liu's estate became the town's first museum in 1958.
Twenty seven mansions survived the turbulent years of revolution and now make up the heart of Anren old town, mostly in the form of hotels or restaurants.
The accessible buildings have now become a major attraction for wedding parties and mansion feasts.
Despite its colourful history, Anren didn't evolve as a museum town until Jianchuan Fan, a real estate developer-turned-collector-and-curator, decided to open a private museum here in 2003.
There are currently 24 exhibition spaces open, covering 100,000 square meters (1.1 million square feet) and housing more than eight million items including historical artefacts, commissioned artworks and reproduced photographs, themed around the Sino-Japanese war, the Mao-era, Chinese culture and the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.
Ticketed exhibits follow themes -- there's the War Series, the Red Series, the Earthquake Series and the Folk Series.
In the War Series, the Hall of Unyielding Chinese Prisoners of War tells the stories of Chinese POWs through a series of photographs.
The Earthquake Series and the Folk Series are smaller.
Individual museums costs RMB$20 ($3) to enter.
The estates are split into four main areas: the Liu Family Old Manor, Liu Family's Historic Home, Precious Artefacts Gallery and Rent Collection Hall.
The buildings are still well-preserved and the interiors are often in keeping with the era so it's worth having a peek at some of the architecture and murals on the walls.
The Film Museum is free to enter but tickets to movie showings cost RMB$10 ($1.6).
