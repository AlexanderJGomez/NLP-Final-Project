"As it relates to crimes against individuals ... the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim's life was not taken."
But what happened to all that "shouldn't expand death penalty to crimes where the victim's life was not taken" language from the Supreme Court?
They do, and they have.
As it relates to crimes against individuals, though, the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim's life was not taken."
While it varies from state to state, as a very general proposition, the death penalty is almost universally reserved for the crime of murder.
As another very general proposition in the States, murder -- plus something on top that makes it more egregious -- is what will qualify as a capital crime.
If you commit an inherently dangerous felony, and a death results, you can be charged with "felony murder," which in some states qualifies you for the death penalty.
As a general rule, horrific murders qualify, but sometimes a nonhomicide crime such as espionage qualifies.
So what exactly will earn you the death penalty?
If your crime is against the state, however, the Supreme Court will give the state some leeway in killing citizens.
