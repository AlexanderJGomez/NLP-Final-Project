BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- Riot police descended on scores of anti-government protesters in the streets of Thailand's capital as violence intensified early Monday.
Rivers said protesters had slashed the tires of a police van.
Thousands of "red shirt" protesters have rallied for days to demand Abhisit's resignation.
The red shirts have given the prime minister repeated deadlines to resign, but those have come and gone.
Thaksin said he would return to Thailand to lead people in a march on the capital if necessary, according to the report.
A police officer was led away by demonstrators and beaten, said Sathit Wongnongtoey, an official in the prime minister's office.
Also Sunday, police arrested a leader of the red shirt movement -- named for the color of their demonstrators' attire.
