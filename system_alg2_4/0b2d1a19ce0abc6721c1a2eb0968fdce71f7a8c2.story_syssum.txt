(CNN) -- Bahrain has revoked the citizenship of 31 Shiite activists, the latest clampdown on the opposition amid continued unrest in the Persian Gulf kingdom.
The Interior Ministry statement Tuesday said the country's Citizenship Act "allows the kingdom the right to revoke the citizenship of anyone who is charged with being a threat to the state's security," Bahrain TV reported.
Rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch similarly condemned the move.
The government decision "seems to completely disregard their basic rights," said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch.
But Amnesty International said the move breached people's right to free speech.
The country is strategically important for the United States in the region and it is home to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet.
