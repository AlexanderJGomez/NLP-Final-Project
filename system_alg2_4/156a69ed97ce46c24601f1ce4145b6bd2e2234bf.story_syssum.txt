"It's true I think also to say that we have kind of rediscovered it because the great Italian archaeologist Rodolfo Lanciani reported the discovery of a theater in the 1860s but nobody could actually find it," says Professor Simon Keay, a leading expert on Roman Archaeology at the University of Southampton.
The site is a feast for the eyes in the true Roman sense.

Clearly we have completely exposed this area and because these buildings are so big it is only by uncovering large areas of them that we can actually understand their function and their development," says Keay.
The site is ironically less than a mile from Rome's modern transport hub, Fumicino International Airport, and this discovery owes more than a nod to modern technology.
The excavations in Fumicino, Italy, just outside Rome, continue in a joint project named "Portus" with the University of Southampton, the British School at Rome, The Italian Archaeological Superintendency for Ostia and the University of Cambridge.
