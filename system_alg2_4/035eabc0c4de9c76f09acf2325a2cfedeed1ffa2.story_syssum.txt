(CNN) -- The Ohio state Senate passed a bill Wednesday that would curb the collective bargaining rights of public workers and strip away their power to strike.
"I've been saying for weeks that we have the votes to pass this bill.
Democratic lawmakers described the proposal as union-busting.
"It passed by the most narrowest of margin," said Democratic State Senator Joe Schiavoni.
Earlier Wednesday the measure sailed through a Senate Labor Committee following a last-minute GOP shuffle that resulted in the replacement of Republican Senator Bill Seitz.
Ohio, often considered a battleground for presidential politics, faces an $8 billion shortfall in the next two-year budget.
