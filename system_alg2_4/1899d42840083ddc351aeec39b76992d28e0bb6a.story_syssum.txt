The ruling followed a surprise appearance on the witness stand by Jordan Linn Graham, who faces first- and second-degree murder charges in the death of her 25-year-old husband, Cody Johnson.
"We went on a little stump part and we were in the middle of an argument and he thought I was going to run away," said Graham.
Her federal public defender Michael Donahoe has asserted in court documents that his death was an accident.
During her 15 minutes of testimony, Graham accused FBI agent Stacey Smiedala of making her uncomfortable by placing his hand on her knee during an interrogation.
In a case that has gained national attention, Graham did not initially report the incident.
Only after a FBI agent Smiedala showed her a surveillance photo of the couple entering the gates to Glacier National Park did Graham change her story and confess to pushing him off the ledge.
Defense attorneys claimed failure to record the first hour and 20 minutes of the interrogation violated state law.
Donahoe, the public defender, has criticized prosecutors for labeling Graham a sociopath, accused them of distorting statements she made, and contended they recorded only those segments of interviews that bolstered the government's case.
The case is being prosecuted in federal court because the incident occurred in a national park.
