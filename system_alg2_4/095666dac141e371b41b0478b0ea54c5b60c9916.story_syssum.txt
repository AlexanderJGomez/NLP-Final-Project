(CNN) -- The late Kemal Amin "Casey" Kasem was much more than a relic of radio's Top 40 heyday.
From 1970 to 1988, his syndicated weekly program, "America's Top 40," documented the ever-shifting mainstream of musical tastes.
Easily accessible and free of charge, "America's Top 40" was a gateway drug for a generation or two of budding music fanatics.
The sturdy scaffolding under Kasem's success was his voice: upbeat, naturally modulated, soothing without being smarmy.
Kasem managed to be commercial without coming across like a hyped-up huckster.
When "America's Top 40" debuted in 1970, the rock revolution was in full swing, and free-form FM radio was on the rise.
The Top 40 renaissance of 1984, kick-started by MTV, and the late '90s teen pop explosion can both be seen as vindication of Kasem's rigidly democratic format.
In the end, what could be more American?
