A line began to form at the Apple Store here on the eve of the iPhone 4S release, as is often the case around the world during the company's product launches.
Crowds of Apple fans, family friends and people who have seen him riding his Segway around the neighborhood stop to say hi, take pictures and ask for his autograph.
"Now your phone is not going to be worth as much when you sell it," Wozniak said to one woman before signing her iPhone 4.
Flowers, partially eaten apples and notes were laid in front of Apple Stores around the world, including this one, where the memorial was set just a few feet from Wozniak's spot in line.
"I want to get mine along with the millions of other fans," Wozniak said.
Wozniak said that he is usually further back in line at these events but that fans in front of him insist that he get his devices first.
Wozniak arrived about noon, and he plans to stay overnight in order to get the new iPhone first, he said.
He first met Wozniak last year in line at a nearby store during the launch of the original iPad.
Wozniak said he had already ordered two iPhones to be delivered to his home; he's in line to buy one for his wife.
"The line is doing nicely," Wozniak said after surveying the area.
David Gandy, a furniture designer who is looking to change jobs, said he came to soak up some inspiration from Wozniak.
" said one fan, who had her picture taken with Wozniak.
I voted for you."
