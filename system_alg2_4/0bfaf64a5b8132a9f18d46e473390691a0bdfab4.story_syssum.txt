Winner: 11-year-old Sebastien De La Cruz, "El Charro de Oro" (the golden horseman) who became a national story after he sang the national anthem at Game 3 of the NBA playoff series between the San Antonio Spurs and Miami Heat and showed a lot of a talent, heart and class.

On one hand, you have someone who goes before a national audience and shows his love for a country where dreams come true.
Now, which do you think represents what it means to be an American?
Meanwhile, De La Cruz took the high road.
"To be honest," he said, "It's just the people how they were raised.
My father and my mother told me that you should never judge people by how they look.
De La Cruz is a Mexican-American born in San Antonio.
The part about De La Cruz being Mexican-American, as opposed to a Mexican immigrant, is essential to the story.
I'm from San Antonio born and raised, a true San Antonio Spurs fan."
The next chapter will be where some Mexican-Americans actually turn on De La Cruz for appearing to distance himself from Mexico.
He's a Mexican-American.
Flanked by San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, and his wife Erica -- the boy returned to center stage and belted out an even stronger performance the second time around.
"To be invited back to sing the national anthem is just amazing because now I know the San Antonio Spurs like how I sing," Sebastien said.
The San Antonio Spurs is a classy outfit that boldly took a stand against bigotry and ignorance.
