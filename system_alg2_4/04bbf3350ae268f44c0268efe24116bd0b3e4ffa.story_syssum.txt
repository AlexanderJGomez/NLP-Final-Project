(CNN) -- A few hundred yards from the Pearl Roundabout, the epicenter of Bahrain's protest movement, you can be blissfully unaware of the turmoil that has suddenly engulfed this island kingdom.
Big international banks are coaxed into setting up here; Bahrain is the banking center of the Gulf.
High-profile international events are staged here -- including round one of the 2011 Formula 1 Grand Prix, but that was canceled last week due to the unrest.
On Tuesday, 32-year-old Reida Houmeid was laid to rest in the seaside village of Al Malkiya.
It showed him sitting on his father's shoulders, a broad smile on his face.
After the funeral, his brother Ghidir said Reida would sit in his boat and talk for hours about Bahrain and "what was wrong."
At the Pearl Roundabout, re-occupied by protesters since Saturday, one display shows satellite photographs of all the property purportedly owned by King Hamad and the royal family on the island.
Late Wednesday, some of the 23 political detainees released on Tuesday were due to appear at the roundabout to address a growing crowd.
The crown prince is leading an initiative to start a dialogue with opposition groups, and the government is offering various olive branches.
The crown prince has also set no deadline for protesters to leave the Pearl Roundabout.
Regional commentators say the Saudi nightmare is to see the al Khalifa family toppled, with the Shia gaining ascendancy on an island so close to Saudi Arabia that it is linked by a causeway.
In another world away from those sparkling malls, a gritty and unpredictable power struggle is underway in the Gulf's smallest country.
