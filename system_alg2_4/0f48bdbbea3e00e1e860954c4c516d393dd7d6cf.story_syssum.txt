The warning came the same day the United Nations said the first of 5,500 additional peacekeepers had arrived in the country.
Kiir has accused rival politician Riek Machar, his former vice president, of trying to stage a coup.
Fighting broke out between Kiir's government and supporters of Machar on December 15 in the capital city of Juba.
The news of a possible deal comes as United Nations officials work feverishly to finalize details of sending peacekeeping reinforcements to South Sudan.
On Friday, 72 peacekeepers arrived in Juba, according to the United Nations.
Meanwhile, U.N. officials and aid workers struggled to protect and provide food, shelter and medical care to those who have fled the fighting, which has spread to seven of South Sudan's 10 states, according to the United Nations.
