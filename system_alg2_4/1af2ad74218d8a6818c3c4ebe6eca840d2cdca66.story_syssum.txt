(CNN) -- A blustery nor'easter that made travel throughout the Northeast absolutely miserable Tuesday is going to stick around for a few more days.
Heavy rain tapered off Tuesday evening, but some areas were still flooded, the New York office of the National Weather Service said.
Andrew Cuomo said, according to CNN affiliate WCBS.
"It's pretty bad.
Snow will stay inland with over a foot of snow from northern New York to Maine.
Some areas could get up to 12 inches of snow by Thursday.
The highest elevations of northern California might get 10 inches of rain, forecasters said.
Southern California might get 1 to 2 inches with twice as much in the hilly areas.
