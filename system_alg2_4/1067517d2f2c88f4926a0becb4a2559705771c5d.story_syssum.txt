Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania (CNN) -- Starting a business is never easy, but in Tanzania, the obstacles for women can be particularly fierce.
And to think, it all started with a cow.
"It was that 'a-ha moment.'
Kisyombe sold milk from her cow, Sero, in order to raise money to start her business.
By offering loans to women in a range of industries, SELFINA is effecting change throughout Tanzania, though Kisyombe envisions the women she supports will have a global impact.
Shumari is also hoping to develop a fish pond where she can farm tilapia for the local market in Dar Es Salaam.
Ultimately, she sees SELFINA encouraging women in a broader context than business.
"They are given an equal opportunity to become economically empowered, socially empowered and politically empowered," she says.
