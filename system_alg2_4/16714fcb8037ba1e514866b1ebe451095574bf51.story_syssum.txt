"We were intrigued by this radio soap, its background and its popularity in Rwanda," Steketee said.
The radio drama raised important questions for Steketee and Blankevoort, and they wanted to explore the way this fiction could contribute to real reconciliation.

Steketee and Blankevoort's documentary, "Love Radio," combines the story from "Musekeweya" with behind-the-scenes insights from everyday Rwandans and people involved in the making of the radio drama.
"I photographed listeners in their homes, on the streets, during the broadcast of "Musekeweya,' " Steketee wrote in an e-mail.
I have tried to capture the veneer that covers the complex and tense social fabric of Rwanda today."
"There is rather a climate of control than dialogue," she said.
"Rwanda is doing remarkably well," Steketee said.
