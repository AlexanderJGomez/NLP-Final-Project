Singer Phil Everly -- one half of the groundbreaking, smooth-sounding, record-setting duo, the Everly Brothers -- has died, a hospital spokeswoman said.
Rolling Stone labeled the Everly Brothers "the most important vocal duo in rock," having influenced the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Simon & Garfunkel and many other acts.
"The amount of music that can be directly traced to the Everly Brothers is incredible," wrote one admirer on Twitter.
"Thanks, Phil...and 'Bye Bye.'"
In 1957, they found a Felice and Boudleaux Bryant song, "Bye Bye Love."
After averaging a Top 10 hit every four months over the next few years, the Everly Brothers inked a 10-year pact with Warner Brothers Records (formerly part of CNN's parent company, Time Warner, though now owned by Access Industries) in 1960.
By the 1970s, the pair was performing in a band that also included legends Warren Zevon and Waddy Wachtel.
Their remaining years were highlights by occasional shows, hall of fame inductions and various other honors, including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997.
