There are 2.1 million registered voters in Iowa.
Mike Huckabee won the caucuses that year with nearly 41,000 votes, beating Mitt Romney by more than 10,000 votes while being outspent considerably.
As a result, center-right Republican candidates who might have the best chance of winning Iowa in a general election have a hard time making inroads in the conservative caucuses.
Conventional wisdom states that the top three finishers in the Iowa caucuses are all winners, with a chance to win the nomination, especially if they exceed expectations.
This year, we have a real horse race with no clear leader -- polls say establishment candidate Mitt Romney is in pole position, followed closely by libertarian Ron Paul and the surging social conservative Rick Santorum.
But his well-funded campaign was able to buy aspects of a statewide organization and negative ads to tear down rivals.
One of the fascinating aspects of the Romney campaign is that he seems to have a glass ceiling of 25% -- the same percent of the caucus vote he received in 2008.
His supporters are by far the most dedicated, if not the most numerous.
If Rick Santorum's recent momentum continues, he can claim the evangelical mantle as the consistent social conservative alternative to Romney, the man he endorsed in 2008.
The countdown to the Iowa caucus can now be measured in hours, instead of weeks or months.
