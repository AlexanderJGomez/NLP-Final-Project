Sarah Palin's charisma is such that she doesn't need to hold an office to wield influence, Matthew Continetti says.
Before the day she joined the 2008 Republican presidential ticket, Alaskans saw Sarah Palin as a champion of ethics in government who had twice defeated oil interests, governed with Democrats in a bipartisan manner and brought down powerful members of her own party.
By the following July, Palin's approval numbers had sunk to the mid-50th percentile, the coalition on which she governed had collapsed, and most of her time was spent combating a hostile media and frivolous ethics complaints.
Knowing almost nothing of the feisty hockey mom turned political dragon-slayer, some in the media turned rumors -- had Palin supported Patrick Buchanan?
-- into established facts.
Something about Sarah Palin riles people up.
The Democrats in the state legislature who once had been Palin's allies turned on her.
The Palin family's personal legal liability is around half a million dollars.
Palin did nothing to deserve the acrimonious venom that has been flung at her non-stop since she first appeared onstage with McCain.
On July 26, Palin will be a free woman.
She can make money to pay the bills.
She can pick her battles without being hemmed in by the state legislature and bureaucracy.
Two of these three dizzying moves ended up in victory, and one did not.
Speculation about her presidential ambitions is premature, though it will be much easier for her to build a national organization now that she has no professional ties to Alaska.
