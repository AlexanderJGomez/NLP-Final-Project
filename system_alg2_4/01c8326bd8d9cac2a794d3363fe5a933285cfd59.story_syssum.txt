(EW.com) -- To promote her Fox comedy "Raising Hope" (which begins its third season October 2), Martha Plimpton pitched a funny idea.
The network thought she was joking, but she was serious.
[Laughs] It's a funny thing: A lot of people who haven't seen the show yet say they haven't watched because they're not really sure what it is.
But I think this show is a lot smarter than people realize.
And I think it's really smart, and it makes me laugh.
[Laughs] Because I don't laugh at a lot of things.
Clearly.
For example, as a laundry expert, I never use fabric softener on towels because it makes them less absorbent.
I don't know if I'll be doing this in the home of our winner, but I like to iron my sheets.
I'm that kind of odd person weirdo.
