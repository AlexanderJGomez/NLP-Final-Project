The Red Sox, defeated the Cardinals 6-1 on Wednesday to win their eighth World Series title and cap a wicked good worst-to-first season that delighted a city dealing with the aftermath of the deadly bombings at its signature marathon in April.
Series MVP David Ortiz, walked four times -- three times intentionally -- and scored two runs for the Red Sox.
"This jersey, that we wear today, it doesn't say 'Red Sox.'
Stay strong," he said, echoing the newly minted "Boston Strong" motto.
It's the club's third World Series title in the last 10 seasons -- albeit the first that they've celebrated on their home field since 1918.
