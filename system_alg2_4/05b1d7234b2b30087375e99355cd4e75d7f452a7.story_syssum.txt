(CNN) -- The Davis Cup is the just about the only major honor in tennis to elude Roger Federer and the Swiss maestro took another big step to righting that omission Sunday as he led his country into November's final against France.
Fognini had four break point chances in the third set but could not take advantage and Federer moved clear in the closing tiebreak.
We couldn't be happier," he said.
Federer and Australian Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka won their opening singles rubbers Friday but the Italians hit back the following day as Fognini and Simone Bolleli took the doubles to give themselves a glimmer of hope heading into the reverse singles.
France is seeking a first Davis Cup triumph since 2001.
