But then came along high gas prices.
Even most of those who agree presidents can't do much to lower gas prices acknowledge they must be perceived as doing everything they can to ease the suffering.
If President Obama can't change the perception that he can't do anything about it, he could find himself pumping his own gas after November.
President Obama can argue that changing his policies would not dramatically increase domestic oil supplies in the short run.
He responded by lifting an executive branch moratorium on oil and gas exploration in the Outer Continental Shelf regions in an effort to jump-start production, and high prices subsided by fall.
The Republican candidates, who seem never to miss an opportunity to take on the president, must seize this moment to push for an energy policy that would better serve the interests of the middle class.
The president is right that drilling alone will not satisfy our domestic needs.
It must include an all-of-the-above approach to technology as well -- including fracking, mapping and drilling -- and it must again involve building refineries.
If gas prices don't retreat soon, Americans will cancel their vacations, the seasonal industries that depend on those vacations will wilt, consumer spending will slow and the administration's hopes of showing concrete signs of an economic recovery by Election Day will fade.
In that scenario, the president could find himself out of a job -- and it will be his own fault.
