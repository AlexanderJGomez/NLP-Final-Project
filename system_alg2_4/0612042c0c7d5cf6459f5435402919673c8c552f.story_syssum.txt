(CNN) -- Mychal Bell, a black teenager accused of beating a white classmate and who was the last of the "Jena 6" behind bars, was released from custody Thursday after a juvenile court judge set his bail at $45,000.
Al Sharpton said outside the courthouse.
"Let America know -- we are not fighting for the right to fight in school.
Many said they were angry that the students, dubbed the Jena 6, were being treated more harshly than three white students who hung nooses from an oak tree on Jena High School property.
Walters said his decision not to appeal was based on what he believed was best for the victim in the case.
He said last week's march, which included Sharpton and Martin Luther King III, did not influence his decision.
A district judge earlier this month tossed out Bell's conviction for conspiracy to commit second-degree battery, saying the matter should have been handled in juvenile court.
Prosecutors originally charged all six black students accused of being involved in beating Barker with second-degree attempted murder and conspiracy.
Thursday, the FBI said it had been made aware of allegations of threats.
The December 4 attack on Barker came after months of racial tension, including at least two instances of fighting in the town, sparked originally when three white teens hung the nooses.
"I firmly believe and am confident of the fact that had it not been for the direct intervention of the Lord Jesus Christ last Thursday, a disaster would have happened," Walters said.
"My Bible says that we should do -- we should be loving, love your neighbor as yourself.
