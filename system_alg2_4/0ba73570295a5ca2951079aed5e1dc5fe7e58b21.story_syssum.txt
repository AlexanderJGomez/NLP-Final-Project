Then the terror began.
It started with an explosion and gunshots around 5:30 a.m. Thursday (10:30 p.m.
According to AFP, the gunmen separated the students by religion and allowed Muslims to leave.
Whatever their religion, hundreds of students managed to escape, said Dennis Okari, a reporter with CNN affiliate NTV.
It wasn't until about 15 hours after the attack began that the explosions and gunfire around Garissa finally ended.
Some of those students, at one point or another, were believed to be hostages in one of the four dormitories on campus.
"I am lucky to be alive, because I jumped through the fence with other students."
And that's largely thanks to Al-Shabaab.
Needless to say, that aim isn't shared in most places -- particularly in Kenya, where more than 80% of citizens are Christian.
Garissa University College began in the 1990s as Garissa Teacher Training College before evolving, by government decree, into its current form as a degree-granting institution in 2011.
It's too early to tell what the future now holds for Garissa University College.
