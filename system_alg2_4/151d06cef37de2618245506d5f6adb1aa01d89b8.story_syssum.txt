MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- One of two men charged with killing the crew of the Joe Cool charter fishing boat last year has agreed to plead guilty to first-degree murder, a victim's relative said.
None of the victims' bodies has been found, and authorities have said it is unlikely they will be.
The trip should have taken about an hour each way.
This spring, Zarabozo said in court documents that Archer killed the crew, using Zarabozo's gun.
"They said he was going to plead guilty," he said of Archer.
Jeff Branam said the government's case against the two appears strong but said he's glad a jury won't decide Archer's fate.
Archer befriended Zarabozo, 20, who left Cuba with his family.
He maintains his not guilty plea, and he plans to proceed to trial."
A court has awarded custody of the children to Kelly Branam's stepsister, according to relatives.
