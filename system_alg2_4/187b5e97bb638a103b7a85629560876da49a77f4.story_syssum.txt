Sometimes, in the midst of all the bad news, in the midst of the mistakes this country inevitably makes, we lose sight of how much the people of the United States are counted on by those in need.
But the United States has been at the forefront, as it has so often seemed to be in so many places when hope was in short supply.
Someone to travel many miles, with the will and the means to heal.
We're used to hearing it.
It is not the first time the United States has been chastised, and it will not be the last.
In Haiti the words refer to the 82nd Airborne, yes, but they also refer to the American doctors who are volunteering their time and risking their own safety to soothe the pain of people they had never before met.
The words refer to the American search-and-rescue teams who work past the point of exhaustion as they seek signs of the living among the rubble, and they refer to the Americans back home who, during difficult economic times in the U.S., have donated their money to help people who, for now, have no way to say thank you.
We will at times focus on the trivial and the coarse.
And to let the words remind us that, when we set our souls to it, we still can aspire to be the hope of the world.
