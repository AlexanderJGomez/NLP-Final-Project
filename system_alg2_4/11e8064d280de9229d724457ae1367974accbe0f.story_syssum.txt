(CNN) -- In her new book "10-10-10," Suzy Welch advocates a fast and reasoned approach to decision making by asking readers to think about the impact their decisions will have in 10 minutes, 10 months and 10 years.
Then you take each decision -- each messy decision, each complicated decision; it's not about "Where do we go to dinner?"
I think gut is no way to live your life.
If you ask a neuroscientist what gut is, [he or she would say] some of our gut reactions are hardwired on the savanna plain at the beginning of humankind.
So I say, listen to your gut.
I'm just quoting that Talking Heads song, but you can wake up when you're 40 or 35 and say, "Oh, my God, I lived the last 10 years for someone else."
I've talked to many, many people now who use it.
If your values hurt other people for your own financial advancement, a good 10-10-10 decision isn't going to undo that.
Welch: I write about it in the book.
Since I started using 10-10-10, I think that I've gotten my decision making in a great place.
...
Because like with that one, you're saying there are good things that come of it.
...
I've heard Oprah talk about gut reactions and trusting yourself.
The book says very clearly that gut has its place.
And I don't say "don't listen to it."
Sometimes gut is great, and sometimes gut is just easy.
