A flesh-eating drug that turns people into zombie-like creatures seems to have made its way to the United States.
"It's a zombie drug -- it literally kills you from the inside out," Singla said.
Krokodil causes serious damage to the veins and soft tissue infections, rapidly followed by gangrene and necrosis, according to a 2013 study (PDF).
Geller said he hopes the drug "doesn't show its ugly face" in Georgia but said doctors across the country are aware of the drug.
"It's not clear how widely used it is in the U.S.," Geller said.
"It wasn't until the next day that they told us that it was krokodil."
There have been many confirmed cases of krokodil abuse in Russia and Ukraine.
Mortality rates are high among users, according to the study.
"This may be an inexpensive high compared to other drugs, according to its reputation, (but it) is more likely to cause withdrawal symptoms and be a real problem for users," Geller said.
According to the Joliet hospital, the five people brought in who may have used krokodil said they thought they were buying heroin.
"I think it's the tip of the iceberg; I think it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better," said Singla, the addiction specialist.
