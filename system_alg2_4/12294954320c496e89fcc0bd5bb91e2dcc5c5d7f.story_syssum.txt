Now that he has been found guilty on every count, the jury must decide whether Boston Marathon bomber Tsarnaev, 21, should live or die for what he has done.
I miss her a lot," said William A. Campbell Sr., dabbing at his eyes as he described his daughter, a 29-year-old restaurant manager who was killed in the first blast at the 2013 Boston Marathon.
She was the one who could round up the family and put on big celebrations, he said.
To understand the toll Tsarnaev's bombs took, jurors must know the stories of his victims, the prosecutor said.
There was the photo of Campbell as a little girl in a red tap-dancing outfit.
"She traded that in for a bat," Campbell said.
By contrast, jurors also were left with an indelible image of Tsarnaev, taken when he was in a holding cell in the very courthouse where the trial is being held.
Tsarnaev saw the people he killed as "the enemy," she said.
The stories they told on the witness stand were even more gripping and horrific than the stories told during the guilt phase of Tsarnaev's trial.
Chaos like I'd never seen and never hope to see again," she said.
When she looked around, she saw blood and muscle everywhere.
"I remember looking around and it just seemed like there were bodies everywhere, blood everywhere."
Looking down at the blood I was just shocked that much blood could come out of someone," she said.
She said she began to scream.
"And then our whole world just exploded," she said.
She remembers being knocked to the ground, hearing nothing and then screams, and seeing blood everywhere.
She wondered if she would die.
"I remember thinking I was going to die, that no one could go through that much pain.
I remember thinking I wanted to die.
She remembers telling herself: " 'Hell no, I don't want to die.
This can't be the end.'"
But she can never forget she's a double amputee.
"You don't realize until you're a double amputee how many dips and hills and inclines there are," she said.
Daily life is literally an uphill battle.
