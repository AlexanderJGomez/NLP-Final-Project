New Delhi, India (CNN) -- A U.S. federal air marshal may have violated Indian law after failing to properly secure his law enforcement equipment when inside the country, U.S. officials said Friday.
Aggarwal, the joint commissioner of Delhi police, said that "quite a few rounds (of ammunition) and two magazines" were discovered inside an air-conditioning duct in a hotel room.
Neither Indian nor U.S. officials released the names of the Italians or the federal air marshal.
