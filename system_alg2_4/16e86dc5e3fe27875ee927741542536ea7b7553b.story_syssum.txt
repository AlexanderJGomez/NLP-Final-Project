Police have more than one confession in the case and the individuals will be charged with murder, said Robert Parker, director of the Miami-Dade Police Department.
The police investigation revealed the suspects thought the house was empty, Parker said.
The men knew Taylor lived at the house, Parker said.
Police said Garcia and Taylor were awakened by noise in the living room, and that Taylor got up and locked the bedroom door, but the door was kicked in and two shots were fired, one striking him in the leg.
A police report said someone forced a window open and left a kitchen knife on a bed.
He did not play in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay.
Dubbing him "the prototype NFL free safety," the Redskins credited Taylor's team-leading tackling prowess for sending him to his first Pro Bowl after 2006.
