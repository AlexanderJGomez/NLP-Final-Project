Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A suspected U.S. drone strike in Pakistan's tribal region killed six suspected militants on Wednesday, intelligence officials told CNN.
Pakistan has formally asked the United States for an apology for the March 17 strike.
"What is this?
The official added that Pakistan had asked the United States to curtail its drone strikes in remote tribal areas.
The drone strike came just two days after Pakistan's intelligence chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, met with CIA Director Leon Panetta at CIA headquarters to voice his government's complaints about CIA activities in his country.
The official said the United States has "an obligation" to protect American troops fighting militants on the Afghanistan side of the border.
The official said if the Pakistanis don't take action against extremists operating in their territory, than the United States will.
"Pakistan needs to talk more about what they're doing and less about what they think the U.S. is doing," the official said.
