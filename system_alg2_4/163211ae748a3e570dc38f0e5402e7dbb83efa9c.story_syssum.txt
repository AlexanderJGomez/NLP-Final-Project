Syria feels far away; a tragedy, no doubt, but to many who strongly oppose any kind of intervention, it is simply too removed, too complicated, too foreign to view as an American problem.
Here are five reasons why:
2) Chemical weapons will be used in future battlegrounds: More than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria.
Horrified by the effects of chemical weapons in the battlefield, nations have come together over the years to develop international bans on nerve gases, blister agents, blood agents and choking agents.
If it passes without a response, this will not be the last time we see these weapons in use -- and not just in a distant battlefield.
But any hope that the situation would somehow resolve itself has only produced the worst possible outcome.
In the meantime, the war is bursting beyond Syrian borders.
4) Inaction will hand a victory to al-Assad, Iran and Hezbollah: The Obama administration is telegraphing an attack against Syria aimed at punishing al-Assad and sending a message to the world, rather than seeking to change the course of this civil war.
Without forceful American action, al-Assad's latest maneuvers constitute a victory for his regime and its top allies, Iran and Hezbollah.
5) A new generation of hatred will perpetuate this tragedy: The war in Syria has raged for 2Â½ years.
It is now a hate-filled maelstrom of Sunnis, Shiites, Allawites, Christians, Kurds and others.
The United States and its friends should strike al-Assad in a way that shows the world will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons, and prove that America's threats and international commitments have meaning and muscle.
Without sending any U.S. troops into Syria, the United States and its allies should find and strengthen the more moderate members of the opposition so they will gain the upper hand against extremists within opposition ranks.
