London (CNN) -- Female drivers in Formula One are few and far between, but one woman aiming to change this is Susie Wolff.
I have an older brother and we got little karts.
He's a film director and he's just been commissioned to make a documentary on my job in Formula One.
Big break: The Young Driver of The Year award is a very prestigious award in Great Britain and I was the first ever female to make the final six.
(Team founder) Frank Williams was always very interested in the fact that one of his board members (Wolff's husband, Toto Wolff) had a wife who raced.
Now, they are giving me the chance to be a development driver -- not just a one year deal, a proper chance to show what I can do.
I do a lot of back and stomach exercises and for the braking I need to have quite strong legs as well.
Blazing a trail: I don't race to prove how good women can be against men.
Many girls who are really interested in motorsport watch Formula One and see no females there, so maybe they don't understand what they could do.
Everyone does what they can and what they're good at.
They never said to me, 'You're doing something unusual.'
She never complained.
I was trying to get a drive in with Renault and got dropped by them at the last minute.
It was quite a journey to get to where I am today and that was a point when I thought it was all going to fall apart.
Sometimes there's not a lot of people around who believe in you, but you must always be willing to strive for your goals and never give up, even when things get really tough.
I'm much harder.
I'm more focused on what I'm doing.
