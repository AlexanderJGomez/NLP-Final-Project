Three major markets have turned into anchors of redevelopment in the city, driving Johannesburg's renaissance as the surrounding blocks become magnets for restaurateurs, artists, students and increasing numbers of tourists.
The Neighbourgoods Market (73 Juta St., Braamfontein, Johannesburg; +27 11 403 0413) is a place people hear before they see it.
Those who prefer their food cooked can head across the way for the best fried chicken in the city (served over watermelon and fries).
The Braamfontein neighborhood pulls a curious mix of people.
On the east end of downtown, the weekly market at Arts on Main (268 Fox St., Johannesburg; +27 11 334 5947) opened five years ago in a century-old building that was originally a liquor warehouse.
This is also one of the city's best places to sample food from around South Africa.
Out on the sidewalk, there's a braai shack where fresh meats are grilled on the street and served with chips or pap, finely ground corn meal served thick like mash potatoes.
The surrounding streets host independent shops and cafes, as well as the city's only art house cinema, the Bioscope (286 Fox St., Johannesburg; +27 11 039 7306).
At the opposite end of Fox Street, The Sheds (1 Fox St., Ferreirastown, Johannesburg; + 27 84 057 0015) is the newest of the markets, housed in a complex of former mining warehouses.
It's the food, and drink, that draw in the crowds.
And there's the full range of traditional South African market fare, including biltong and fantastic cheeses, but also a surprising selection of bubble teas -- the milky drinks often filled with tapioca pearls or fruit jellies that originated in Taiwan.
