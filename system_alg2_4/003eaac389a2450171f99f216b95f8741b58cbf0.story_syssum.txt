Wednesday's building collapse in downtown Philadelphia left six dead and 13 people injured.
"My client is being made the scapegoat in this situation," said Daine Grey, Benschop's attorney.
Grey told reporters Saturday that while his client feels "extremely sympathetic and remorseful," he is not guilty.
"Justice will only be served if Sean Benschop receives a sentence that buries him in a jailhouse forever, just like his victims were buried on Wednesday," Nutter said.
The first lawsuit against him was filed that same day, by attorneys for a 54-year-old woman pulled from the rubble by a firefighter.
