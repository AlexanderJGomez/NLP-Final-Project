JACKSON, Missouri (CNN) -- Debbie Shank breaks down in tears every time she's told that her 18-year-old son, Jeremy, was killed in Iraq.
Eight years ago, Shank was stocking shelves for the retail giant and signed up for Wal-Mart's health and benefits plan.
After legal fees were paid, $417,000 was placed in a trust to pay for Debbie Shank's long-term care.
"We assumed after three years, they [Wal-Mart] had made a decision to let Debbie Shank use this money for what it was intended to," Graham said.
One week later, their son was killed in Iraq.
Legal or not, CNN asked Wal-Mart why the company pursued the money.
Jim Shank said he believes Wal-Mart should make an exception.
He's afraid he won't be able to send their youngest son to college and pay for his and Debbie's care.
"The recovery that Debbie Shank made was recovery for future lost earnings, for her pain and suffering," Graham said.
The damage she recovered was for much more than just medical expenses."
But just last week, the high court said it would not hear the case.
For now, he said the family will figure out a way to get by and "do the best we can for Debbie."
