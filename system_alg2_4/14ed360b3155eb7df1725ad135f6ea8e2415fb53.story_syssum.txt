Readers have his latest book to digest.
The idea that "The Labyrinth of Osiris" could be his last book is all the more poignant, because reviewers and editors alike say it's his best -- even Sussman agreed.
Taylor recalls: "He turned to me and said, 'Simon, I do think perhaps I've written quite a good book here.'
Taylor remembers Sussman riding around London on his motor scooter, with a publicist in tow, on his way to interviews to support his books.
His widow didn't finish his latest book until after his death last year.
She says she yearns to talk to him each time she finds one of the inside jokes he scatters throughout "The Labyrinth of Osiris."
Each book includes a character called Alexandra (Alicky's full name).
"I think one of the really, really difficult things about losing someone is the conversation ending," Alicky says.
"All of those things that you would normally talk about," she says.
His agent says she has a manuscript Sussman wrote more than 10 years ago.
But readers soon realize that the narrator isn't a murderer at all; rather, he just failed to prevent accidents.
Susijn says the unpublished manuscript reflects its author even more than his subsequent novels, largely because it's so funny.
His literary team also worries that introducing a new work too soon after his latest crime thriller's release could distract readers from the marketing campaign around his existing books.
"I think it would be great if ... they can make a few bucks, or if they just want to make sure that the fans are happy," she says.
"For me, he's very much alive," Susijn says.
"He knew how to tell a rip-roaring story," says Taylor of Transworld Publishers.
"That's basically his legacy," Susijn says.
