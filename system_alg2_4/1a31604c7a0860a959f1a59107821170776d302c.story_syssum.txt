(CNN)  -- Two people were found dead and a third person is still believed missing in a North Carolina food plant heavily damaged in a morning explosion, police said Tuesday night.
"There was no warnings, no signs," Garner Mayor Ronnie Williams said.
Police said recovery workers still were trying to get the two bodies out of the plant, which makes Slim Jim food products.
More than 300 people were in the plant when the explosion happened, authorities said.
A section of the roof was collapsed, and pipes could be seen spewing liquid believed to be ammonia.
The Garner plant is known for producing Slim Jim beef jerky products.

I was just trying to get out, and then we just [saw] people that [were] burned -- blood all over them."
