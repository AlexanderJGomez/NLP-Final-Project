Asked which school meals were their favorites, students at a public school in the New York borough of Queens don't say chicken fingers or meatballs.
Walcott was at the Active Learning Elementary School this week to celebrate its move to all-vegetarian meals five days a week.
The school went meatless three days a week about a year and a half ago.
"We've been working with tofu for a few months," Groff said.
Other options might include roasted chickpeas, vegetarian chili and brown rice, or falafel, the city Department of Education said in a statement.
But "the vegetarian menu fits right in with our mission, and we are thrilled that our students in pre-kindergarten all the way up to grade three understand the importance of healthy and nutritious meals," Groff said in a statement.
Groff worked closely with the department so that the menu changes came at no additional cost to the school.
"As far as we know, (Active Learning) is the only public school in the nation that offers an all-vegetarian menu," Feinberg said.
