At issue is whether three people named by President Barack Obama to the board were ineligible to serve because their appointments were made while the Senate was technically in a "pro forma" session during the 2011-12 winter holiday break.
The court majority concluded recess appointments would be valid if those breaks lasted 10 days or more.
"We conclude that the Recess Appointment Clause does not give the President the constitutional authority to make the appointments here at issue," Justice Stephen Breyer said.
But the court said the executive could use his power to make recess appointments even when the vacancy occurred before the Senate goes on break.
"Since President Obama took office, Senate Republicans have done everything possible to deny qualified nominees from receiving a fair up-or-down vote," said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada.
While agreeing with the outcome of the narrow question presented, four more conservative justices worried that the ruling would allow the President to retain a good deal of the "powerful weapon" of making recess appointments.
Some GOP lawmakers also accused the President of flip-flopping on the issue.
Company executives said the board lacked a binding quorum because the recess appointments made by Obama were not legal.
The legal basis comes from a 1993 Department of Justice brief saying the president should act only if the Senate is in official recess more than three days.
