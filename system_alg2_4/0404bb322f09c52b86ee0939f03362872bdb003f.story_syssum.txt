LONDON, England (CNN) -- It is still remembered as one of the worst days in the history of modern sailing.
Some of them drowned and others succumbed to hypothermia.
"It was a catastrophic event that had far-reaching consequences for the sport, the biggest of which was in the design and safety of the boats," Rodger Witt, editor of the UK-based magazine Sailing Today told CNN.
It was devastating."
At the time of the tragedy the Fastnet race was the last in a series of five races which made up the Admiral's Cup competition, the world championship of yacht racing.
Ware said that even today the tragedy "still spooks me."
"The night before we'd noticed high winds but there'd been no forecast of bad weather so we didn't think much of it," Ware told CNN.
Ware said the worst part for him was fielding calls from concerned relatives.
