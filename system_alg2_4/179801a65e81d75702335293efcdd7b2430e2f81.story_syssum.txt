(CNN) -- Police charged an 18-year-old with murder in the case of a University of Florida student last seen eight days ago, a police spokesman said Friday.
The 18-year-old Aguilar was last seen about 6 p.m. September 20, according to a police statement.
Police told Aguilar's family about the murder charge -- and, with it, the presumption the college student was dead -- about an hour before the public announcement, Tobias said.
He was later charged with depriving a victim of medical care, a third-degree felony, and was in custody at the time he was charged with murder, according to Tobias.
Bravo's family initially volunteered to help in the search, only to be politely turned down by Aguilar's family, Kozlowski said.
At that time, a judge will assess the case and set bail for Bravo or decline to, thus assuring that the suspect will remain in custody.
