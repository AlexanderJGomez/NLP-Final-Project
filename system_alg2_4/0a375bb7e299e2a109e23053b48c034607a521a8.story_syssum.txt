Most of our creditors get little or nothing back.
They choose to stop paying, one way or another.
How do they choose to default?
But let's be clear, the U.S. was not going to default.
So, the USA cannot really default, thanks in part to a strong Federal Reserve and international creditors still wanting to buy its bonds, no matter how low the interest rate falls.
In Russia's case, it was able to pay back creditors within a few years, thanks to the rise of energy prices.
They want their money back.
After all, it means a country can get a handle on its obligations.
Nazi Germany defaulted in 1933.
New creditors stepped in, instead of walking away.
We know them as the troika -- made up of the European Central Bank, European Union and International Monetary Fund.
If not, that would be a default.
All this makes you wonder why the USA would even want to be mentioned in the same breath or paragraph with these countries.
