Maybe not.
Why don't all airliners stream their so-called black box data to satellites in real time?
Let's break it down.
• Two transponders that could send identification and altitude data to air traffic control radar screens.
To understand why, you first have to know a little about the technology and the gaps in the system.
Aircraft flying more than about 200 miles from land over oceans are not tracked by air traffic control radar screens.
In these cases, air traffic controllers see only a blip on radar screens.
• But  primary radar operated by the military in Malaysia and Thailand is able to track the 777 for limited periods without its transponder being on.
This provides evidence that Flight MH370 ended somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean.
In the wake of the tragedy, some called for airlines to modify their transponders to prevent anyone from being able to shut them off in flight.
We might know more about what happened to MH370 if air traffic controllers used orbiting satellites to track airliners, instead of radar.
So the industry is testing a space-based system -- where planes would  determine their position via GPS satellites and report those coordinates via communication satellite network wherever they are in the world.
Another emerging technology that might have helped us know more about what happened is called AFIRS, the Automated Flight Information Reporting System, developed by a Canadian company called FLYHT.
If all airliners were equipped this way, we could know a flight was in trouble even if the crew could not communicate by other means.
And this week, Australia's air traffic control manager, Airservices Australia, announced a test partnership with Malaysia and Indonesia to track long-haul flights over remote ocean routes.
Although technology continues to shrink the planet in terms of communication, the tragedy offers a bitter reminder of how easy it still is to lose an entire airliner full of people.
