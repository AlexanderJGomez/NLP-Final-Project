Rice, who is believed to be President Barack Obama's choice to replace Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, triggered controversy with her appearance on television talk shows in the days after the Benghazi attack to explain what was known about it.
In a statement released after her Senate meetings on Tuesday, Rice said that she explained to senators that "the talking points provided by the intelligence community -- and the initial assessment upon which they were based -- were incorrect in a key respect: There was no protest or demonstration in Benghazi.
Republicans feel that the administration misled the American people before the presidential election, won by Barack Obama, because an al Qaeda attack countered the narrative that Obama's policies, in Rice's words, had "decimated" al Qaeda.
Other Republicans argue that Rice is not independent enough to be America's top diplomat.
In a dig at Rice, Sen. Bob Corker, who is on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Rice would be a better fit for chairman of the Democratic National Committee than secretary of state.
She has represented the United States and our interests in the United Nations with skill, and professionalism, and toughness, and grace."
In a statement, Reid said, "The election is over.
Others have voiced questions about whether Rice is the best choice for the job -- she is a tough talker who some might see as too blunt to be secretary of state.
A: McCain and several other senators have said that Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, would make an excellent choice.
