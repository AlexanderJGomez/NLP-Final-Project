The university opted to halt all social and new-member activities on the South Carolina campus after the death of a student and a "high number" of reported incidents involving fraternities.
The 19-year-old sophomore went for a run with his fraternity early Monday morning and did not come back, according to the university.
An autopsy revealed the teen likely fell, according to CNN affiliate WHNS.
Tanner Parsons, a freshman at Clemson, says he met Hipps briefly at a fraternity pledge event this year.
Hundreds of students came together Tuesday night to remember Hipps at a candlelight vigil on Bowman Field at Clemson, according to CNN affiliate WLTX.
