EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy told the Republican-led committee that the agency cannot access some e-mails belonging to a biologist who worked on a controversial mining project assessment.
"I heard similar testimony yesterday," replied Rep. Mark Meadows, R-North Carolina, dryly referring to the committee's Tuesday hearing about a critical crashed hard drive at the IRS.
McCarthy insisted the agency is trying to recover the biologists' missing e-mails, but also tried to downplay his role in the mine assessment.
"Which is why it's important the (inspector general) finish his report," McCarthy replied.
"Were all his emails preserved according to the Federal Records Act or was a law violated?"
"You have not complied with the subpoena," he told McCarthy.
"I hope that over the next few days our folks and your folks can resolve this with all the e-mails," Issa concluded.
