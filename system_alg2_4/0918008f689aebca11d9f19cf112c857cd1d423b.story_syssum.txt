(CNN) -- Venezuelan opposition leader Henrique Capriles has announced that he will run in next month's presidential election to replace the late Hugo Chavez.
Capriles, 40, ran against Chavez last year and lost.
My fight is for Venezuela to move forward," Capriles said Sunday night.
The sharp exchange gave a potential preview of what the campaign period might look like -- angry, bitter and deeply divided.
"To be president, the people have to elect you," he said.
"The people will decide."
