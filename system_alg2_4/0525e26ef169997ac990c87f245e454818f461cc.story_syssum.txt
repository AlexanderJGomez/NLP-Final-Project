The shoes prosecutors say Hernandez was wearing at the industrial park where Lloyd was killed also have seemingly vanished into thin air.
Investigators photographed a pair of Nike Air Jordan XI Retro Low brand sneakers during one of their first searches of Hernandez's home, according to court papers, but did not take them in as evidence.
When Lloyd's body was discovered, crime scene investigators singled out one of two footwear impressions early on because one didn't match the "lugged sole" shoes of police, nor the shoes of first responders or civilian witnesses who found Lloyd's body, according to court documents.
That affidavit dated November 14, 2014, says that after studying images and home security video and having "consulted with Nike," investigators believe those three pairs of shoes are "believed to be produced by Nike and Creative Recreation."
Wallace and Ortiz are seen on home security video entering the house and going into the basement after getting out of a car minutes after Lloyd was fatally shot in a nearby industrial park.
In court papers, investigators said the sneakers appear to match shoe prints found at the scene where Lloyd was fatally shot.
Trying to make the case for another search, investigators also quote a jailhouse phone call dated December 25, 2013, between Hernandez and his fiancee Shayanna Jenkins.
How might it play with the jury?
"Jurors will wonder why didn't investigators seize the shoes at the same time they seized many other pieces of evidence from Hernandez's home," says University of New Hampshire law professor Michael McCann, who's closely monitoring the trial.
