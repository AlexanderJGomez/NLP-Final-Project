The number of pilots reporting being targeted by lasers nearly doubled last year to 2,836, up from 1,527 the previous year, the FAA said.
"Shining a laser into the cockpit of an aircraft is not a joke," FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt said in a statement.
But on Wednesday, the FAA planned to release a legal interpretation concluding that laser beams can interfere with a flight crew performing its duties while operating an aircraft, a violation of federal aviation regulations.
Last year, Los Angeles International Airport recorded 102 laser events -- the highest number of laser events in the country for a single airport.
So far this year, the Phoenix and Dallas-Fort Worth areas each have recorded more than 45 laser events, the FAA said.
The Food and Drug Administration, which regulates lasers, required outdoor laser light show operators to notify the FAA of proposed laser operations and resolve any objections that the FAA may have.
