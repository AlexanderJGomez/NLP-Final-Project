GAZA CITY, Gaza (CNN) -- Israeli forces fired on a U.N. aid convoy Thursday in Gaza, killing at least one contract worker and prompting the U.N. to halt some of its operations in Gaza, U.N. officials said.
UNRWA director John Ging said one aid worker was killed.
Ging expressed frustration with the Israeli military, which he said cleared the convoy to travel into Gaza.
Ging said an Israeli liaison did not dispute that Israeli forces fired on the vehicle.
"We have horrific stories coming out now.
Three Israeli civilians and one of those soldiers have been killed in rocket strikes from Gaza.
The Israeli military says its operation is aimed at halting the firing of rockets into southern Israel by Hamas, which has controlled Gaza since 2007.
Much of the U.N.'s aid is stuck at the Kerem Shalom border crossing because the private company that drives the aid in is refusing to enter Gaza "because the situation is too dangerous," U.N. Humanitarian Affairs chief John Holmes said.
Mohammed Hamid, a Palestinian driver, told CNN Israeli forces are stopping ambulances evacuating the wounded.
"We saw a man coming out of that house with a white flag and until now we have seen no sign of any military activity in that area," Wedeman reported.
A three-hour truce on Wednesday was also marred by fighting which Israeli officials said were in retaliation for Hamas attacks on Israeli forces.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
