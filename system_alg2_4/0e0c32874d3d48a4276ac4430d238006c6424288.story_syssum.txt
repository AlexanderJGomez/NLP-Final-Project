(CNN) -- Kaci Hickox, a nurse who worked with Doctors Without Borders to treat Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, was placed under mandatory quarantine in New Jersey for three days even though she tested negative for Ebola and is asymptomatic.
For over a hundred years, the Supreme Court and other tribunals have upheld the right of states to enact compulsory laws related to health care issues such as vaccination.
Consider the infamous 1927 case of Buck v. Bell -- a cautionary tale for all medical students -- in which the court upheld a state's involuntary sterilization of "feebleminded" persons in state institutions.
Since then, the court has specifically recognized that the general health and welfare of the public may require adults be dealt with by compulsory treatment including quarantine, confinement or sequestration.
State governments have historically enjoyed nearly unfettered power to restrain our liberty in the name of public health.
Of course, the unintended side effect of patient autonomy is overreaction.
The court cases that protect these liberties may leave the public with a strong and perhaps unrealistic impression about what constitute unassailable, bedrock "rights."
The courts continue to recognize the government's broad "police power" to legislate for its citizens' health, safety and morals.
She may be right if the medical evidence supports her view.
What undoubtedly feels to Hickox like a violation of "basic human rights" may not automatically be the same as the "fundamental rights" closely guarded and scrutinized by the Supreme Court.
When it comes to infectious diseases, the collective jurisprudential message is as clear today as it was in centuries past: Public health concerns can warrant the state's intrusion on personal freedoms.
