(CNN)When Kyesha Smith Wood heard that her teen daughters were rude to another patron who asked them to be quiet at a local movie theater, she was furious.
The woman I'm looking for addressed them and asked them to be quiet and they were disrespectful," Wood wrote on her Facebook post.
"The note from their mom brought me to tears and shows there is still good people in the world," Boyd wrote on the sheriff's department Facebook page.
Glad they are learning a lesson.
I am so humbled by that."
