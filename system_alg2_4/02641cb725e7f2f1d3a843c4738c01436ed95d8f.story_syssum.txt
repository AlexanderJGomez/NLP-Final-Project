An Israeli soldier was killed Sunday in a shooting along the Israel-Lebanon border, according to the Israel Defense Forces.
Earlier Sunday, a spokesman for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL, had said that a "serious shooting incident" was taking place along the Israel-Lebanon border.
Israeli and Lebanese forces are cooperating in the investigation, the statement said.
UNIFIL has been in southern Lebanon since a 1978 conflict with Israel.
There were no casualties.
