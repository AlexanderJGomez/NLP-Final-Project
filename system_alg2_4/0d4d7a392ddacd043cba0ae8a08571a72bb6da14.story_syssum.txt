Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN)Jaquita Gonzales still tries to call her husband on his cellphone.
She can't.
"You never know, he might pick it up, or someone who has them would let them have the phone and you know, the hope is still there."
We tap into that hope in order to go on day by day," says Gonzales.
Gonzales' lifeline, apart from family, is her work.
But not a day goes by without her thinking of Patrick.
Like Gonzales, many other families CNN has spoken to say they live in hope that their loved one are still alive even though it seems now a virtual impossibility.
Anger at the Malaysian authorities and Malaysia Airlines who, Gonzales says, are ignoring them.
But now she has gone public after what she describes as the Malaysian authorities continued "mishandling" of the disappearance.
I would put it that they just don't care.
Families were not been given any advance warning of the announcement and, even though it clears the way for compensation claims, they say there is just no evidence to support the statement.
Nathan says she only heard that the government was planning to make the statement when local media rang her.
It was a group decision that we speak to the media because (the authorities) never respond to anything we write to them or ask them about," she adds.
"I am just going through the motions,' says Grace.
