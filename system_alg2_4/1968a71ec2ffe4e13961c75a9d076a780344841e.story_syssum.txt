The leading candidate, interim President Bronislaw Komorowski, failed to garner more than 50 percent of the vote, which would have clinched victory in the first round of voting to replace President Lech Kaczynski, who was killed in a plane crash in April.
Jaroslaw Kaczynski, once prime minister, is a divisive figure in Polish politics.
"Poland has to be a strong country, otherwise it will not exist," he said recently.
"We have been on this road for 21 years together and we have been right," Komorowski said on the campaign trail.
The president, his wife and more than 90 others were killed in western Russia on their way to the 70th anniversary of the Russian massacre of Polish prisoners of war in the village of Katyn.
