The word was Ruzzle.
So, just to be sure, I Googled this strange new word and discovered that Ruzzle was actually a popular game app for your mobile device.
But not really.
Nevertheless, a little half-hearted research revealed that this uber-popular word game seemed to be the offspring of a wild and kinky one-night-stand between Boggle and Scrabble.
Like Boggle.
Obviously, it's a game of high stakes.
What's that?
OK, so the player with the most points actually just wins.
The ensuing e-mail conversation went like this:
Constantly getting beat by your mom.
Fortunately, there are plenty more strangers to go around.
Then you'll stop loosing [sic] in Ruzzle."
For him.
That last one might not actually be a game.
Plus, I just keep "loosing" to my mom.
