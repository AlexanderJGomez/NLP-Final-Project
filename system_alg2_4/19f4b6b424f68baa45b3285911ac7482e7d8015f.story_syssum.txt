Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- After 10 days of mourning and thousands of emotional eulogies and speeches, South Africa finally buried its most famous son, Nelson Mandela, on Sunday at his rural village of Qunu in the Eastern Cape.
South Africa is a country adrift.
The economy is in trouble, with growth forecasts cut again and again over the past four years.
Thabo Mbeki, Mandela's successor who was removed from the presidency by Zuma in 2008, said last week that there was increasing frustration among ordinary people about the direction the country was taking.
"So when they look at some of the things that are happening....when they see this corruption in the country, which seems to be increasing at all levels of government, the people are aggrieved.
Ordinary South Africans inured to corruption told me last week that they have no doubt that his hiring was corruptly influenced.
Members of the ruling ANC and society are now asking questions about the current crop of leaders' ability to get South Africa out of its current slump.
Is South Africa about to descend into racial conflagration because Mandela is gone, though?
Doomsayers have beaten this drum many times before in the past 19 years, even when Mandela left government in 1999.
The young are ubiquitous on the streets and they are now being attracted in significant numbers by the young, former ANC radical Julius Malema's breakaway party Economic Freedom Fighters.
For many here, that change will come with the 2019 national elections.
