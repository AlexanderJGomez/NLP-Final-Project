Hartmann's genetic code showed two mutations that are linked to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, he says the site told him.
Genetic testing can be a powerful tool.
It can also be misleading.
The action triggered outrage among some of 23andMe's supporters.
Though it's been 10 years since the Human Genome Project was completed, scientists still don't understand what every gene does, and what a mutation might mean for someone's health.
Scientists have identified more than 2,000 single gene disorders, says Rebecca Nagy, president of the National Society of Genetic Counselors.
"It's not that the science behind (this kind of genetic testing) isn't good.
The upside of these at-home genetic testing kits -- and 23andMe isn't the only company that sells them -- is that they've generated a lot of buzz about genetics, Nagy says.
No one is or should rely on it for medical 'diagnosis.'
Nagy recommends anyone who wants to do genetic testing first talk to a genetic counselor.
"Know what you're doing so that when you get the results back you can really use them to your best benefit."
He says he submitted his "bug report" to the company and it apologized.
Hartmann says he now believes he will not get limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, although he says there is a risk he could pass the genetic mutations onto his kids.
