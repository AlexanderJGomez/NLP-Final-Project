BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Hurricane Bill spun northward toward the New England coast Saturday with wind and rain as officials warned beach lovers to head indoors for the night.
Swells as high as 19 feet are expected Monday night, Coast Guard Petty Officer Jordan Berryman told CNN in Chatham, Massachusetts.
Bill's sustained winds remained at 100 mph, with higher gusts.
The core of the storm should pass New England offshore Saturday night, and approach Nova Scotia on Sunday.
A tropical storm warning was issued for the coast of Massachusetts from Woods Hole to Sagamore Beach, including the islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket.
The hurricane itself is predicted to stay offshore, the hurricane center said.
Rip currents, or riptides, are strong seaward flows of water that occur where there's a break in the shoreline.
Patrick said advisories will be posted, and beaches on the cape were closed.
Hurricane Bill skirted Bermuda, leaving rain in its wake.
A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area within 24 hours.
