The two cheetahs had been separated from their mother so they could be vaccinated, weighed and swabbed for DNA.
Zoologists at the Smithsonian National Zoo have cross-fostered a cheetah cub, persuading a female cheetah to become a foster mom to an at-risk cub.
When another singleton female cub was born to 9-year-old Zazi, the zoo biologists decided to sneak the first cub in with the second and see if Zazi would raise both as her own.
Then they put the two cubs in a box together and let Zazi in.
Cheetahs are considered to be vulnerable on the World Conservation Union's Red List of Threatened Animals.
"Hey buddy, nice teeth," Padilla told the young male as he took a look in his mouth and swabbed a sample for DNA testing.
"Last year, we had our new young male coalition, and we wanted to literally teach them about female cheetahs and how to breed because they were very young and inexperienced," Crosier said.
So we are not sure which of the boys fathered the second cub."
