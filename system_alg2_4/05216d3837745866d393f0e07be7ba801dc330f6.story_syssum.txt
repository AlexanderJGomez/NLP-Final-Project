The 36-year-old chose Australia Day to make his decision public, coming at the end of the third day of the fourth and final Test against India in Adelaide.
"It is with great pride and happiness that I make the decision to retire from Tests and one-day internationals," he said in a statement on Saturday.
He has been similarly prolific in 277 one-dayers, scoring 9,297 runs at an average of 36 and reaching three figures 15 times.
Jaques was the first to fall, bowled by India captain Anil Kumble for a patient 60 off 159 deliveries.
