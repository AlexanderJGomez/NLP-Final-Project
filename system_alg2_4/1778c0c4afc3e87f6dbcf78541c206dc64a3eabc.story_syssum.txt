(CNN) -- "No one's ever asked to see my birth certificate.
But what, exactly, did Romney reveal with this pre-meditated "offhand" remark?
We already know that because he appears on media friendly to the right but limits the number and kind of questions reporters can ask him, and then responds with dodging answers.
Romney -- hiding behind the plausible deniability that it was just a joke, with a wink and a nod to the extremists in his base -- tried to divert attention from the ABC's haunting his campaign: Akin, Bain, "Corporations are people."
It is sad that a campaign stretch that began with his asking Obama to stop apologizing for America (something fact checkers noted the president never did) and roundly debunked welfare attack ad ended with a xenophobic and roundly debunked birther reference.
His birth certificate dog-whistles are not just desperate, they are deliberate.
How we respond to Romney's remark will reveal a lot about us, as well.
The media, too, will reveal a lot about itself by its response.
As I said, we shouldn't be surprised by Romney's remark.
-- Show us your birth certificate, but I won't show you my tax returns.
It's not where you were born -- in a cabin or a mansion -- or how you were raised -- in poverty by a single parent or with money and privilege -- that matters.
