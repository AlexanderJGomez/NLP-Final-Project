Nina and Edgar Otto say their cloned puppy crosses his paws like the original dog did.
The puppy Lancy looks and acts just like Lancelot, their first Lab, who died a year ago, say the Ottos.
No," Edgar Otto said, adding, "This is a really sweet dog, and ... we're very happy that we did it."
They say Lancy walks just like Lancelot and crosses his paws like him, too.
"It's as close as you can get," Edgar said.
"This dog was immediately accepted by the nine dogs," Edgar Otto said.
Four customers who also placed winning bids in an auction by BioArts International will have their dogs cloned, and those pets will be delivered in the coming months.
BioArts says it's an expensive process and the company is still analyzing whether pet cloning can be a viable, profitable business.
But, the Ottos say, he's taken a particular fondness to a bush planted at the spot where his original, Lancelot, died last year.
The Ottos can do whatever they want with their money, but "a shelter dog just lost out on a great chance of having a home," said Cherie Wachter of the Humane Society of Broward County, Florida.
"The only reason I don't go to the Humane Society is because I would bring every one of them home," Nina Otto said.
"Think about this," he said philosophically.
