It's an unmanned aerial vehicle -- commonly called a UAV or a drone -- and it's coming to deliver your order right to your front door.
But it should concern every American when other nations are on the cutting edge of new technology and the United States is lagging behind.
Foreign governments have quickly embraced its potential and have passed safety rules allowing a diverse array of commercial users to operate UAVs.
But the United States has fallen behind in the race to explore where this new technology can take us.
Unfortunately, they are long overdue, and the pace of rule setting is inhibiting America's competitiveness in the UAV technology race.
Imagine a firefighter using a UAV to gain a bird's-eye view of emergencies and use that new perspective to contain flames better.
Whether it's a UAV or something yet unimagined, emerging technologies are transforming the way the world works in the 21st century, providing businesses, individuals and governments with potentially game-changing opportunities.
As technology advances rapidly, government must pick up the pace and catch up.
