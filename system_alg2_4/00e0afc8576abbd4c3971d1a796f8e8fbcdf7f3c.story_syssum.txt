One-time basketball bad boy Ron Artest, who changed his name to Metta World Peace and said it was meaningful and inspirational, was ejected Sunday from the Los Angeles Lakers-Oklahoma City Thunder game for hitting James Harden in the head with his elbow.
"During that play I just dunked on (Kevin Durant) and (Serge) Ibaka, and I got really emotional and excited.
The Thunder, they're playing for a championship this year, so I hope that he's OK and I apologize to the Thunder and to James Harden," he said.
World Peace's act was called "disgraceful" by game commentators, and sports analysts said the behavior was reminiscent of the ball player they once knew as Ron Artest.
Sports fans were baffled, some even amused, when World Peace announced last year that he planned to legally change his name from Ron Artest.
Back when World Peace was still Artest and playing for the Indiana Pacers, he made headlines in 2004 for his role in a brawl between players and fans at a Pacers-Pistons game after somebody threw a drink on him.
For his work with the youth, he was given the NBA's citizenship award for philanthropic work.
But in the world, peace sometimes comes with a price: The NBA is now reviewing World Peace's less than peaceable actions.
