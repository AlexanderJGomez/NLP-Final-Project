The magic is photography.
Or as I like to see it: My camera can also make calls.
In photography, the equivalent is taking an image that evokes strong feelings, regardless of which device captured the picture or its nostalgic hue.
But instead of marveling at all the choices, there's some grumbling.
An inexpensive and easy-to-use camera in every hand didn't usher in the end of photography or automatically turn everybody into Richard Avedon.
For me, photography is my memory.
This little act of magic does not divorce me -- as the critic Susan Sontag implied in her book, "On Photography" -- from the here and now.
The pictures of my childhood had a warmish, faded, slightly out of focus feeling.
When we discover an old, faded, cracked and torn image, we handle it with care and respect.
Because I know that time cannot touch my digital images, I add in the passage of time by using filters.
It is all about time.
Let's embrace photography, as it exists now.
