But with six, half-ton raging bulls and their menacing horns closing fast, the run can strangely seem like an eternity.
Many even try their luck with the bulls.
The bulls are faster, and the runners -- now more than a thousand most days, and even more on weekends -- are densely packed.
But for novices and others who don't know enough, there's fresh help.
It's possible some others who in the past have been gored or even killed may not have known it, or heeded it.
There've been 15 deaths since records began in 1924, most recently in 2009 when a 27-year-old Spanish man was fatally gored in the neck.
This year, animal rights groups again plan demonstrations decrying the bull running and subsequent bullfights where the animals are killed, in the afternoon.
Yet those eight days included just 17,813 bull runners, some of them repeat participants over several days.
And one of my questions has brought an intriguing answer: some international revelers say they've never read anything by Hemingway.
But they've picked up the gist: Pamplona, they will tell me, is a must see: this wild fiesta and this dangerous bull running.
