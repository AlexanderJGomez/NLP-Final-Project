(CNN) -- Welcome to the new cool.
The fist-bumping.
Slopestyle, which also has a ski discipline, is one of 12 new categories at 2014 Winter Games -- eight of which have their origins in extreme sports.
As is the idea of fun, which the winner of the men's slopestyle skiing event, Anderson's fellow American Joss Christensen, was keen to reference.
Christensen had never won a major competition, and only qualified for the Olympics two weeks ago.
"I hope I made my father proud," he said.
Did it for him."
Their main event, the X Games, is all about showing off new tricks in fairly relaxed, showbiz atmosphere.
"They found it (the competition) cool and now they wait for the party.
Along with the incredible tricks, style is a big part of these competitions.
"I have been skiing like this for 10 years now.
That's not a view shared by the U.S. Olympic Committee, which has specifically targeted invested in these new sports, primarily because they deliver medals for America.
