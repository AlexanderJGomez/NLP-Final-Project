The District of Columbia coin honoring Duke Ellington was introduced Tuesday in Washington.
Members of Ellington's family were present at the ceremony, and the jazz band of Duke Ellington High School performed.
His orchestra's theme song, "Take the A Train," is one of the best-known compositions in jazz.
He died in 1974 at the age of 75.
African-Americans including Jackie Robinson, who broke baseball's color barrier, have appeared on commemorative coins.
Educator Booker T. Washington, botanist George Washington Carver and the first Revolutionary War casualty, Crispus Attucks, all of whom were black, have also appeared on commemorative coins, according to the U.S. Mint.
