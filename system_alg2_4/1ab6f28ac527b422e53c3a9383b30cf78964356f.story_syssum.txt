(CNN) -- Journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee told Ling's sister they were treated humanely in North Korea, and they believe they weren't sent to hard-labor camps because they have medical conditions, Lisa Ling said Friday.
Laura Ling and Lee were working for California-based Current TV, a media venture of former Vice President Al Gore, when they were arrested in March for crossing the border between China and North Korea.

Lisa Ling said her sister was allowed to call the family on four occasions during her five months in captivity.
It could only be President Clinton to secure the release of herself and Euna.
Laura Ling is "doing well," and Lee is "skinny," Lisa Ling said, joking that her mother tried to force-feed Lee on Thursday "because she's just become so diminutive."
"So even communicating is a challenge because she sometimes yesterday was even having a hard time getting full sentences out, so it's a slow adjustment," Lisa Ling said.
" the sister said Thursday.
Lee and her husband went to Laura Ling's house Thursday night for their first pizza since being released, Lisa Ling said Friday.
She said she always knew they would come home.
I didn't know when it would happen, but I never lost that hope."
