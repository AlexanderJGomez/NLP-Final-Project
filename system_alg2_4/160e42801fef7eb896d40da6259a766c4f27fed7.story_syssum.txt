(CNN) -- With her glamorous looks and exceptional talent, Nigerian movie star Genevieve Nnaji is one of Africa's most successful actresses.
CNN's Pedro Pinto caught up with Nnaji before her latest movie premiere in London to discuss fame and her passion for Nigeria.
GN: Nigeria is a unique and a peculiar country, and as the people, we are too.
Nigerians on the whole are very confident people.
We do have that bond and I think it has to do with our background and how we are raised....I would never live anywhere else to be honest, no.
GN: I don't think I ever realized that, for a long time I kept thinking, OK, this is just temporary, definitely I'm going to go back to school and read law, English or something that I wanted to do.
But I can't complain.
So it's an honor to be honest but I think it's probably the vein we have on the forehead, I think that's what we have in common.
Mostly because there is still something inside of me that I just feel I haven't let out and it's really trying to come out and trying to burst loose so I'm hoping for that opportunity...I just want that story, that story that challenges me even further.
