That's the message the University of Virginia is trying to send its students and others after a scathing Rolling Stone story detailed allegations of a gang rape at a fraternity party, and the school's supposed indifference toward students who are victims of sexual assault.
"To the survivors of sexual assault and their families, I am also sorry."
The actual specifics of the new policy will be worked out later, university officials said.
"I feel if a person is willing to come forward in that setting and admit they violated the policy when there is absolutely no advantage to do so, then I feel that deserves some consideration, that they are willing to say, 'I have done something wrong and I am willing to take my licks and deal with it,'" Eramo told reporter Catherine Valentine, explaining why no one had been expelled.
Eramo said there had been 38 reports of sexual assault last year.
Jackie and other victims of assault at the school said Eramo helped them tremendously as they dealt with what happened to them.
Another victim who spoke to CNN, Lyra Bartell, said that Eramo has "the hardest job at UVA" and said the problems highlighted by Rolling Stone are more about the policy than about a person.
The university also announced that the state attorney general has asked the law firm O'Melveny & Myers to do an investigation of how the school responds to reports of sexual violence, especially in cases where alleged victims choose not to make a formal complaint.
