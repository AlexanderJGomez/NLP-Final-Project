No one would disagree that government should act, but how?
Why?
This works, even if a person can take an additional portion.
So, there is good reason to believe New York's portion control would work.
Why doesn't the ban apply to milky drinks, why can 7-Eleven sell large sugary drinks, and why not ban refills?
Consider one of the judge's major arguments: balancing public health and economic considerations is "impermissible."
It assumes that unless public health does everything, it can do nothing.

The fingerprints of the food and restaurant industries, with their clear economic conflicts of interest, are all over the public and judicial campaign to block the soda ban.
