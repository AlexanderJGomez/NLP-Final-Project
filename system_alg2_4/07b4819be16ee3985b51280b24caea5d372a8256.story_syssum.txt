As many as 20 sleeper cells of between 120 and 180 people could be ready to strike in France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, a Western intelligence source told CNN.
It is believed ISIS directed the men to return to Europe to launch attacks in retaliation for airstrikes against the terror group in Syria and Iraq, according to the official.
• The suspected Islamist terrorists who had a shootout with police on Thursday in Verviers, Belgium, have ties to ISIS-linked cells in other European countries, a senior Belgian counterterrorism source told CNN's Paul Cruickshank.
• An 18-year-old woman was arrested at Stansted Airport near London on suspicion of terrorism offenses, London's Metropolitan Police said on Twitter.
• Two people suspected of involvement with the alleged terror cell in Verviers were detained trying to cross from France into Italy through the Frejus tunnel, a spokesman for Belgium's federal prosecutor's office said.
• The suspected terror cell, which included people returning from Syria, planned to target police officers, Van der Sypt said.
• Two men in their early 40s were arrested in Berlin on suspicion of links to ISIS, police said.
• The current level of security in Belgium will remain for at least one month and will then be evaluated to determine if it needs to be modified, the country's prime minister said late Friday.
European counterterrorism agencies have been trying to identify and thwart potential threats after the deadly attacks in Paris last week, in which 17 people were killed.
But his attorney said the arrest was not connected to the other Belgian raids.
A European counterterrorism official told CNN that there were indications that ISIS leadership had directed returnees from Iraq and Syria to launch attacks in Europe in revenge for Syria and Iraq airstrikes.
