Michael Sam, an All-American defensive lineman from the University of Missouri, publicly revealed that he's gay Sunday, creating the possibility he'll be the first openly gay player drafted by the National Football League.
"I understand how big this is," Sam said in the ESPN interview.
I want to be a football player in the NFL."
The Bleacher Report mock draft projected him to go in the late rounds because "athletic limitations including a lack of flexibility and a lack of optimal size are concerning."
His agent said Monday that he does not think Sam's decision to acknowledge his sexual orientation will hurt his draft prospects.
Michael is a football player.
Last year, a University of Colorado player said an NFL team asked him if he liked girls and had a girlfriend.
GLAAD, a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender media advocacy group, said Sam is  "the latest high-profile athlete to come out as LGBT.
Sam's head football coach at Missouri, Gary Pinkel, said: "We're really happy for Michael that he's made the decision to announce this, and we're proud of him and how he represents Mizzou.
Michael is a great example of just how important it is to be respectful of others, he's taught a lot of people here first-hand that it doesn't matter what your background is, or your personal orientation, we're all on the same team and we all support each other."
