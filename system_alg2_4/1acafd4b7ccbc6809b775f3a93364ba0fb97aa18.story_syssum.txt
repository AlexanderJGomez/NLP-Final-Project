A Florida judge Friday sentenced Michael Dunn to life in prison without parole for the 2012 shooting death of 17-year-old Jordan Davis.
Dunn claimed he acted in self-defense because he believed Davis was reaching for a gun.
"Mr. Dunn, your life is effectively over," Healey said.
Outside court, Davis' father, Ron Davis, said the judge sent a strong message.
In a brief statement before sentencing, Dunn for the first time apologized to Davis' family.
"I did what I thought I had to do," Dunn said.
She said she forgave Dunn.
And so I choose to forgive you Mr. Dunn for taking my son's life.
Davis said he life was changed forever.
...
Unlike McBath, Davis hasn't forgiven his son's killer.
"For me to forgive you, you have to have remorse," he said.
Dunn has said he shot at the vehicle because he thought Davis had a weapon and feared for his life, but the prosecution said Dunn was the aggressor and pointed out that he kept firing even after the teens fled.
After shooting Davis, prosecutors said, Dunn did not call police.
