Elvis Presley bought the property in February 1967, three months before marrying Priscilla Beaulieu.
The property, called the "Elvis Ranch" by locals, is just east of Highway 301 in Horn Lake, about 17 miles south of Memphis, Tennessee.
McLemore said his parents bought the property in 1979 and turned it into a cattle ranch after previous owner-developers had failed to turn it into a resort.
McLemore said he met Priscilla Presley on a winter day in 1985.
"There's still a trailer pad behind the Honeymoon Cottage," McLemore said.
She said she remembers seeing Presley riding a horse along the highway.
However, he said, he doesn't have a serious buyer on the hook and has yet to receive an offer.
