The Queen has managed to "stay above politics" for more than 60 years -- and with Scotland voting on independence Thursday she's not about to upset things now.
The closest Elizabeth II has come to commenting on the referendum was something she said to a well-wisher outside a Scottish church on Sunday, that she hopes people "think very carefully about the future."
That comment was seen by parts of the UK media as a reference to the Scottish referendum.
The Queen has come under pressure from some politicians to step into the debate but that idea was given short shrift.
Due to her popularity, she could sway opinion but royalty is about the long game.
The frontman of the pro-independence campaign, Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, says he looks forward to the Queen remaining as "Queen of Scots" in an independent Scotland.
The managed decline of the empire after World War II is held up as one of Queen Elizabeth's great achievements.
Breaking up the United Kingdom now would prompt an identity crisis for Queen and country.
Perhaps this Jubilee is a time to remind ourselves of the benefits which union has conferred, at home and in our international dealings, on the inhabitants of all parts of the United Kingdom."
