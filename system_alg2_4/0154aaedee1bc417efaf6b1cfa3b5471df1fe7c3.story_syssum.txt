(CNN)Debra Milke spent 22 years on death row, convicted of conspiring with two other men to kill her son allegedly for an insurance payout.
The two men with whom Milke was accused of conspiring were tried separately and are still on death row.
Styers and the friend were convicted of murder and sentenced to death.
The detective, Saldate, said Scott told him that Milke was involved in a plot to kill her son.
Ultimately, the jury believed the detective and convicted Milke of murder.
What prosecutors didn't tell the court was the detective's long history of lying under oath and misconduct.
"The state knew of the evidence in the personnel file and had an obligation to produce the documents," Kozinski said.
"...
And on Monday, all charges against Milke were finally dropped.
Debra Milke is finally a free woman.
