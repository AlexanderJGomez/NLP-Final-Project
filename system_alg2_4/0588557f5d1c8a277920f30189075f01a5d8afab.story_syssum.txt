SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNET) -- In an industry dominated by men, leave it to women to come up with the winning idea in a contest to create a concept for a video game about losing one's virginity.
The contestants are generally given several weeks to come up with a concept for a game based on some sort of unusual challenge posed by Zimmerman.
Still, he said, after word got around about Swift's withdrawal, Lapis designer Kelley and independent developer Robinson volunteered to step up and compete.
The two women came up with a concept for "Our first times," and presented it as a two-level game, one level for Kelley's experience and the other for Robinson's.
It would have to be the least complicated outfit possible, she said, nothing with zippers that get stuck, or too many buttons or ties.
The next mini game would revolve around choosing the proper mood music from a selection of LPs--yes, records, since the game would be set in the timeframe of Kelley's first time.
Being a game concept presented from the woman's perspective, the next mini game would revolve around "making the first move.
But before explaining his final design, he talked at length about the challenges of coming up with a game idea when every possible title was too overtly sexual.
In the end, he said, he came up with a three-act structure for a game based in the virtual world, Second Life, where act one involves the awkward era of high school, the second act is the more promising college years and finally, act three, happiness in the form of a series of vignettes including dates, a wedding, and then, home life.
After all, in the end, the point was to take a particularly challenging game design topic and create something that could plausibly be a working title.
