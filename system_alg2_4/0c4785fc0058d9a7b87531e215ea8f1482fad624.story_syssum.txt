If the music sounds familiar, you may have heard unauthorized, lesser-quality versions circulated by fans for decades -- or similar takes on the several anthology albums released over the years by the Beatles' label, Apple Corps.
Releasing them now gives Apple another 20 years' protection under a recent change in European law.
Apple Corps did not comment to CNN on the motivation for the release, but the timing of the release and their naming it "The Beatles Bootleg Recordings 1963" suggests the connection.
The new release includes the seventh take of "Do You Want to Know a Secret," while the sixth one was released in 1963.
The sixth take of "Taste of Honey" is included from that session.
The new release, the second take, is the third and only previously unreleased complete version.
The two tracks of "From Me to You" offer a glimpse of the group's studio demeanor during another Abbey Road session on March 5, 1963.
Lennon asks before they start another take.
"What are you doing?"
Lennon asks another when the first take falls apart.
Several versions of their first big hit in England, "Love Me Do," "Taste of Honey" and "She Loves You" are included.
The tracks include the BBC hosts' introductions, which remind the listener of where the Beatles were in early 1963.
