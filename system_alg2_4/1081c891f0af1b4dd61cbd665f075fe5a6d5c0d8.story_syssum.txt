Jordan Henderson scored deep in the second half to give Liverpool a 4-3 win over Swansea City, rekindling memories of the Reds' victories over Newcastle by the same score in 1996 and 1997.
But Swansea, under newish boss Garry Monk, didn't cave in.
After Sturridge and Bony traded goals -- the latter's second came via the penalty spot -- Henderson settled the affair in the 74th minute when he scored on his own rebound.
The top four all won this weekend but fifth-place Tottenham suffered a blow in its chase for a Champions League spot, losing 1-0 at relegation threatened Norwich City.
