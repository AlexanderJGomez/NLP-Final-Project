Around $2.7 billion worth of fruit and vegetables were shipped from the EU to Russia in 2013, the bloc's single biggest export to the market.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a tit for tat move against Western sanctions, banned imported European cheese, American chicken and Norwegian seafood from the country's dinner tables.
European countries sold $1.6 billion worth of pork and $1.3 billion worth of cheese and curd to Russia.
With billions worth of food disappearing from the market, prices are likely to go up and experts forecast increased Russian inflation, which is already running at 7.5%.
In 2013, EU countries sold nearly $1 billion worth of spirits and $733 million worth of wine to Russia.
