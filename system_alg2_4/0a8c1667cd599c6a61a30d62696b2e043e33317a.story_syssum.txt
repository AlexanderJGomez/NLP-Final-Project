In Japan, the islands are known as the Senkaku.
Beijing and Tokyo have been clashing over the arrest of a Chinese fishing captain by Japan off the disputed islands.
Japan has since freed the fishing captain, who returned to a hero's welcome in China.
"I 'd like to criticize Japanese government's weak attitude toward China and Senkaku Islands issue, rather than China itself," Sakamoto said.
