Who will take the best actor SAG trophy -- "Lincoln" star Daniel Day-Lewis or Hugh Jackman for "Les Miserables"?
A win by "Lincoln" or "Les Miserables" in SAG's top category -- officially known as "Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture" -- would create important buzz for the film in the Academy Awards best-pic battle.
"Les Miserables," a big-screen adaptation of the smash Broadway musical, was given the Golden Globe for best comedy or musical movie, although "Lincoln" lost to "Argo" in the Globe's best drama film competition.
Chastain and Lawrence won the best drama and comedy actress Globes, respectively.
The others in this well-stocked SAG category include Philip Seymour Hoffman, who plays a spiritual leader in "The Master," Alan Arkin, for his role as a Hollywood film producer in "Argo," Robert De Niro for "Silver Linings Playbook," and Javier Bardem for his role in "Skyfall," the latest James Bond movie.
Anne Hathaway, honored with the Globe for best supporting actress for her performance in "Les Miserables," faces tough competition for the SAG and Oscar awards from Sally Field, who portrayed first lady Mary Todd Lincoln in "Lincoln."
