Russia maximized its deliveries of men and arms to East Ukraine in August and September to coincide with one peak of the crisis in Iraq.
It produced something resembling a plan for ISIS, and some palliatives for the next possible crisis in Eastern Europe by beefing up security in Poland and the Baltic States.
So is the issue of why so many left the UK to fight in the first place.
And Russia's entire modus operandi, of which its current actions in Ukraine are only the most visible part, is not only a challenge to the European order, but a challenge that is dangerously exploiting the many existing problems within the EU.
Russia also wants Ukraine to fail.
Ukrainian voters in the October elections showed a strong desire to get back to the original story.
And if Ukraine does fail to transform itself, it will be only one in a string of dysfunctional states ringing the EU.
Russia and Ukraine are locked together in a spiral of economic decline.
Ukraine also has a humanitarian crisis; the official estimate for IDPs by the UNHCR was already 445,000 by 10 November.
Russia has been causing problems within the EU for years.
Russia is actually keen on Serbia joining the EU, in order to have another client state on the inside.
Specific propaganda messages about Russia or Ukraine are then buried in the post-modern melange.
But Ukraine has to get there first, with the risk of further crises and renewed conflict very real.
