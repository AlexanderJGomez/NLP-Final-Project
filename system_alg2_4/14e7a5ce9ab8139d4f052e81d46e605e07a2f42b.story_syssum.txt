A Kentucky pastor who starred in a reality show about snake-handling in church has died -- of a snakebite.
The National Geographic show featured Coots and cast handling all kinds of poisonous snakes -- copperheads, rattlers, cottonmouths.
"Those risks were always worth it to him and his congregants as a means to demonstrate their unwavering faith.
Tennessee banned snake handling in 1947 after five people were bitten in churches over two years' time, the channel says on the show site.
"He'll give up, just sooner or later," one of the members says.
"Catching two snakes the first day, 'course we'd hoped for more," Coots says in the video.
