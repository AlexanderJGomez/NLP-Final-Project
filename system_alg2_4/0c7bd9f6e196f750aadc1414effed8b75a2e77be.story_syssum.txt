NEW YORK (CNN) -- The New York City Council on Thursday voted in favor of a bill that would extend term limits, allowing Mayor Michael Bloomberg to run for a third term.
The vote followed two hours of lively debate in a packed room in City Hall, where Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum frequently admonished council members for going over their allotted time to speak.
Earlier, the council voted 22 in favor and 28, with one abstention, against an amendment to the bill that would have called for a voter referendum on the issue of term limits.
"Mayor Bloomberg, be like Hugo and let the people decide," he said.
"If we're talking about direct democracy, where the people rule, and a representative democracy, where those who represent the people come to vote -- if you do this, you're undermining the very people that vote you in to represent them," he said earlier Thursday, arguing in favor of the amendment to put the issue to a public referendum.
They should have the right to vote for the current mayor or a new one."
"If the City Council should vote to amend term limits, I plan to ask New Yorkers to look at my record of independent leadership and then decide if I've earned another term," Bloomberg said at City Hall.
According to a Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday, 89 percent of New York voters said the issue of term limits should be decided by voters in a referendum, not by the City Council.
Forty-five percent of voters were in favor of extending the term limits for their mayor.
