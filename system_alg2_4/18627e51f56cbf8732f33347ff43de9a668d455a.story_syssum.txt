(CNN) -- A California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) employee who allegedly wrote a letter to a transgender woman and condemned her to hell has resigned, officials said Thursday.
According to Yust and her attorney, the DMV employee used her confidential personal information to send the letter.
Yust said she also got a pamphlet from a church, which she said contained offensive material directed at her sexual orientation and gender.
Other DMV employees also received training on transgender situations, he said.
It asks for damages in excess of $25,000.
Dolan said of the DMV field representative.
