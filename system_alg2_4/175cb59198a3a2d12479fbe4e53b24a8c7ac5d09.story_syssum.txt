Arielle Spiridigliozzi is one of 350 students who have contracted H1N1 at the University of Kansas.
But it was.
For more than a day, the girls have been stuck in their suite, on what they call "lockdown."
The school provides door-to-door delivery from the campus dining hall, giving the girls one less reason to have to leave their immediate four walls.
It wasn't like I was licking the handlebars of the bus or anything," she said.
While shopping, she came down with a fever and started feeling like she didn't have the strength to stand, she said.
Perry's flu hasn't been confirmed as an H1N1 strain, but a third roommate, the first to get sick, they said, was diagnosed with H1N1.
So, to make life easier for the sick, the school's medical center has distributed what it calls a "flu kit," which includes a mask and a home-care instruction sheet, Denning said.
Spiridigliozzi and Perry will get to wander outdoors again once their fevers have dissipated for at least 24 hours without the aid of fever-reducing medications, they said.
"I got all my homework done," Perry said.
"Yeah, I've gotten all my homework done for the next two weeks, probably," added Spiridigliozzi.
