Having been deemed America's Glastonbury by the music industry -- the highest accolade in the festival world -- Bonnaroo will attract more than 80,000 people to Manchester, Tennessee, beginning Thursday.
Since then, the festival has evolved into a complete musical experience: Drawing from indie rock, hip-hop, jazz, bluegrass and more, today, a more mainstream Bonnaroo continues to honor the spirit the festival was founded on a decade ago, Mayers added.
"So much music today is experienced on a computer screen that it's really great to get out and experience it," Robertson said.
For festival-goers, it's not uncommon for people to have completely different experiences during the course of the long weekend.
Location, Robertson said, is another seller for the festival.
Meanwhile, the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, which takes place in Indio, California, is doing so well, it recently added another weekend to its 2012 schedule.
While Bonnaroo certainly thrives on the extras it offers festival-goers, as well as its diverse musical acts, Mayers says the festival's charm and success really come down to community.

"Music is just the entry point for this platform for all arts -- for people to be creative," he added.
