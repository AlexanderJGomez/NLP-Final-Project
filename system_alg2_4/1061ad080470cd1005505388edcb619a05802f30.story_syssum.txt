Ben Folds was so impressed by a cappella groups' performances of his songs, he made a record with them.
And so an idea was born: Folds would travel to university campuses around the country and record an entire album of a cappella covers.
And to give the music a "field recording" feel, he kept the process simple: Each performance was recorded using six wide-range microphones, and most of the groups got it down in one or two takes.
Ben Folds spoke to CNN about his youthful-sounding new release, why being married four times isn't much of a drama and why he faked an album leak.
Ben Folds: I think it naturally kind of is.
...
I mean these guys, they'd just do a live take and they just don't know that the pros don't do it that way.
I think that people have a natural tuning mechanism.
Folds: I'm not sure what that is.
There's always something new.
Folds: Well, I think that we get very uptight when it comes time to record because there's a process, an imminent process that has to do with just selling the record, mostly.
So while I thought it was funny, I really liked the idea of going into the studio and making six songs in one day.
I think things were kind of cool.
Folds: Well, it wasn't a lot of drama, really.
...
Folds: Yeah, that's heavy, dude.
CNN: I meant physically heavy -- to carry around a record player.
