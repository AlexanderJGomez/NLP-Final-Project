Ruben Navarrette says Sarah Palin's critics challenged her  because of prejudices about small-town values.
Sarah Palin.
People talked about how she was "a real person" who "reflected their values."
Some say the deciding factor was when Koch described life in upstate New York as "sterile" and said he dreaded living in the "small town" of Albany, if elected.
"I think [Palin] had something of a polarizing effect when she talked about how small-town values are good," Powell said.
It wasn't.
I live in a city with a population of more than a million people and I never thought the GOP singled me out as not being a "real American."
"What is this hatred for conservatives and small-town people and Sarah Palin?"
The idea isn't that people who live in small towns have better values than people who live in cities.
During a recent interview with the conservative newspaper, Human Events, Palin was asked if she thought her humble background accounted for some of the flak she got from the media.
Palin acknowledged that she didn't come from elite stock, but said that she was grateful for that.
Sarah Palin understands a lot about America.
