Smoke stacks and exhaust pipes around the world are blasting greenhouse gas emissions to a new record annual high.
Globally, greenhouse gases are being emitted at a slower rate this year than they were last year, and in both years the climb in emissions was less intense than in the past decade taken as a whole, said researchers at Britain's East Anglia University.
The international agreement is designed to decrease emissions contributing to global warming by holding its signees to reduction goals.
Not only must the increase stop, the researchers said, but industrialized nations must achieve a global reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
In 2012, the largest contributors of greenhouse gases were China with 27%, the United States with 14% and the European Union with 10%.
On an individual basis, China and the EU were at the same level, with 7.7 tons of carbon gas emitted per person and year.
