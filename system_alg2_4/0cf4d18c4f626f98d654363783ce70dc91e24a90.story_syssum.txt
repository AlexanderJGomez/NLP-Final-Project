"There was a rumor that there were archives in the Cond√© Nast offices in New York that nobody had known about," says Todd Brandow, a photography curator.
None of the pictures had seen the light of day for eight decades, and all had been taken by the pre-eminent photographer Edward Steichen (1879-1973) for Vanity Fair and Vogue.
"They were taken almost 100 years ago but the pictures felt so contemporary, that's what really excited me.
"Many of them were fashion pictures, but the women looked like they'd been born wearing those clothes, that they wore them every day.
"He was the Picasso of photography," she says.
Now, says William A Ewing, the third of the exhibition's co-curators, the time has come to reintroduce Steichen's work to the world.
"He turned fashion photography into portraiture.
That's what connected so powerfully with the viewers."
He was determined to dedicate his life to his art, and had changed his style to a modernist approach, with clean lines, strong diagonals, and high contrast.
He contacted the magazine and was offered a job.
"He went from rock bottom to being on top of the world almost overnight," says Ewing.
But Nast persuaded him that "it's not about fashion, it's about photography".
"He really was one of the greats," says Brandow.
"He was the founding figure of modernism in photography and the modern woman in fashion photography, as well as modern portraiture.
