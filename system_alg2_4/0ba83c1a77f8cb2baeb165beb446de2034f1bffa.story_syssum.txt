New video released by ISIS shows militants smashing what they say are antiquities at a museum in Mosul, Iraq.
Experts are clear in saying, however, the video represents a clear loss.
"Mosul Museum has 173 original pieces, and there were preparations to reopen the Mosul Museum before ISIS invaded the city in June 2014," Rashid said.
"This attack is far more than a cultural tragedy -- this is also a security issue as it fuels sectarianism, violent extremism and conflict in Iraq," she said, calling for an emergency meeting of the Security Council to protect Iraq's cultural heritage.
