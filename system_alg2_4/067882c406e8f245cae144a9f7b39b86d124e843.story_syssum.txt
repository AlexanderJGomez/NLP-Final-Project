London, England (CNN) -- Passengers on Monday vented their fury at Eurostar management as train services between England and France were canceled for a third day, leaving thousands stranded.
"I am angry that passengers have still not been told what is going on and I have told Eurostar this morning that they must tell the public immediately what their plans are," Khan said.
There was some good news though for stranded passengers, as Eurostar said they would resume a partial service Tuesday.
As we suspected, the acute weather conditions in northern France have caused the disruption," Eurostar said.
"We were prisoners in this train for like 18 hours," one passenger told CNN.
The trains that broke down in the tunnel malfunctioned because the air inside was warmer than that outside the tunnel entrance in France, Eurostar spokeswoman Amelle Mouhaddib said.
The Channel Tunnel is two tunnels separated by a third and smaller service tunnel, so the trains that remained stuck inside did not mean the entire tunnel was blocked.
