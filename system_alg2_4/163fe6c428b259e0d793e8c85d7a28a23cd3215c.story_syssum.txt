(CNN) -- Four days after a U.S. civilian-operated cargo jet plunged into the ground shortly after takeoff from Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, killing all seven people aboard, one expert said that a number of factors likely were involved in the incident.
National said the aircraft had landed uneventfully in Bagram and no additional cargo or people were taken on there, it said.
It identified the crew members as two pilots, two first officers, a loadmaster and two people involved in maintenance.
The cargo aboard ill-fated Flight NCR102 included five mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicles that were being taken out of Afghanistan as part of the drawdown of U.S. forces, said Shirley Kaufman of National Air Cargo.
If the takeoff had been rougher than usual, "it could have caused the cargo in the back of the plane to become loose," Rosenberg said.
"The light person is never going to get the heavy person off the ground," he said.
"When you are a pilot flying a C-130 Hercules over potentially hostile territory, the last thing you need to worry about is whether your cargo is secure," it says.
"Upon takeoff, we'll be looking back at the cargo until we get off the ground, making sure none of the chains break or pop out," Airman 1st Class Michael Brown says in the airfield's story.
"It's a fantastic plane," he said.
That's not supposed to happen."
In its statement, National Air Cargo said it "will not speculate as to the cause of the accident," and that it was fully cooperating with authorities as the investigation continues.
