(CNN) -- A large ice shelf is "imminently" close to breaking away from part of the Antarctic Peninsula, scientists said Friday.
The Wilkins Ice Shelf -- a large mass of floating ice -- would still be connected to Latady Island, which is also part of the peninsula, and Alexander Island, which is not, said professor David Vaughan, a glaciologist at the British Antarctic Survey.
"During the last year the ice shelf has lost about 1800 square kilometers (694 square miles), or about 14 percent of its size," Humbert said.
The Wilkins Ice Shelf had been stable for most of the past century before it began retreating in the 1990s.
It is the largest ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula yet to be threatened.
Some plants and animals may have to adapt to the collapse.
