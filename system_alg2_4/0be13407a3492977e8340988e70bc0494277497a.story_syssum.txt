But the game today?
This is one and done.
The game's at 4 p.m.
If the boys can beat Belgium, it's off to the quarter finals of the World Cup.
When was the last time you saw the country unite behind one cause, gather in front of massive TV screens, and collectively bellow, "I believe that we will win"?
In Brazil, Americans are second only to the host nation in the number of tickets bought.
When the U.S. last played Belgium at the World Cup, it beat them 3-0.
That's because it isn't.
It plays a boring brand of soccer.
It qualified for the World Cup, winning eight out of 10 games.
At the tournament, it's won all three of its games, conceding only one goal.
Un: The Belgians are banged up.
Without those two, the goal scoring potential increases for the U.S.
Deux: Jozy Altidore will be back for the U.S.
And the U.S. has four players who are World Cup veterans (Howard, Dempsey, DaMarcus Beasley and Michael Bradley.)
The last time they were at a World Cup was 14 years ago.
Why?
"He's able to speak French with their players on the field, not with us.
And it's the country that we beat in the last second of the last World Cup."
"It is looking for excuses ahead of the match," Belgian coach Wilmots said.
Today, the natural tendency of the team might be to hunker down, ward off the inevitable Belgian onslaught, and make a run for the goal when chances open up.
So the U.S. needs to go at it guns blazing.
Fun fact #1: Before he became Belgium's coach, Marc Wilmots served in the country's senate for two years.
Fun fact #5: Clint Dempsey has another goal: to make it as rapper Deuce.
The folks at FiveThirtyEight give the U.S. a 42% chance of winning.
