The show grew from the documentary in which filmmakers Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman follow Ariel's brother Nev and his budding online relationship with "Megan," according to the website Iamrogue.com.
"So someone will reach out to me and say, 'I'm really into this guy, we've been talking online for months.
Nev Schulman said in an interview with Iamrogue.
Schulman follows the trail and finds that "Amanda" is really Aaron, who is having trouble coming to terms with being gay.
"For many people the life that they lead on the Internet, which can be exciting, interesting, and can be filled with hopes and dreams that are perhaps outside of the actual range of their situation, is a big distraction and keeps them from living their real lives," Schulman said in the Iamrogue interview.
