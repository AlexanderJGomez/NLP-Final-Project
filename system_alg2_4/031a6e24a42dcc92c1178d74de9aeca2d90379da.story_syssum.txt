(CNN) -- Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega opened the door to the possibility of his country going back to international bodies in an attempt to get a $17 billion payout from the United States.
The United States, which did not recognize the jurisdiction of the court in this case, resisted international pressure to pay, and eventually, under the administration of President Violeta Chamorro, Nicaragua dropped its claim from the International Court in 1991.
The International Court subsequently issued an order removing Nicaragua's case from the court's list, Ostick said.
However, it is unlikely that Ortega would seek such a referendum, which would stir the pot with the United States, he said.
"I would think the case is now closed," he said.
