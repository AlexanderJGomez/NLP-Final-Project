"I didn't like grass at all and when people ask me about grass and when I first went over there, I tell them I hated Wimbledon.
I hated the surface," he told CNN.
The fruits of their labors came in 1992 when Sampras advanced to the semifinals before being beaten by big-serving Croatian Goran Ivanisevic, who subsequently lost to Andre Agassi in the final .
By '92 I felt really comfortable, I was the owner of the place for the next seven years."
"That sixth Wimbledon (title) against Andre I got in the zone," he said.
Federer began his era of domination in 2003, but the 16-time grand slam champion is still one short of the Wimbledon record held by Sampras -- whose tally is matched only by the seven won by Britain's William Renshaw in the tournament's formative years of the 1880s.
The American acknowledges the difference in their playing styles but told CNN that both shared a key ingredient to success.
Sampras accepts that his style of big serving and volleying at Wimbledon is from a bygone era, and he regrets its passing.
