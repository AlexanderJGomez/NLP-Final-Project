On Wednesday, efforts to get to the bottom of the deadly crash hit another roadblock, as Ukrainian officials warned of possible landmines near the site.
The crash site still reeks of jet fuel and the stench of decay.
Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council claimed Wednesday that "terrorists" -- the term it uses to describe rebels -- have set up firing positions and laid mines on the access road to the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17.
Dutch investigators in Ukraine did not mention mines but announced Wednesday that unsafe conditions kept their contingent from visiting the crash site for the fourth straight day.
Dutch investigators have yet to lay eyes on the wreckage or the human remains believed still to be strewn across the huge debris field near the town of Torez.
Some human remains could still be found at the crash site, as well as belongings from the victims scattered about.
Russia and the rebels have disputed the allegations and blamed Ukraine for the crash.
"It's not a new Cold War," he said.
The new and harder-hitting sanctions show the West's waning patience with Russia over its disputed annexation of Crimea, its support of pro-Russian rebels and the impact of the shoot-down of Flight 17, which had many Europeans among the 298 people on board when it went down in eastern Ukraine.
Although heavy fighting has blocked investigators from getting to the crash site, it didn't stop the determined parents of one of the victims.
George and Angela Dyczynski braved the regional conflict and saw the wreckage over the weekend.
"Fatima can only be pronounced dead when the DNA is matched with her body," Angela Dyczynski said.
