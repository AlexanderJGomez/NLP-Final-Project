One show that has been able to get it right is "Smallville," which begins its record-breaking tenth season Friday night on the CW (that would be the longest consecutively running sci-fi show).
At the same time, what was once one of the highest-rated dramas on TV, "Heroes," progressively lost viewers, ending its run on NBC after four seasons.

Executive producer Brian Peterson said, "[Series creators Al Gough and Miles Millar] created a world you could see walking into every week.
Despite appearances by more and more characters wearing elaborate costumes (Green Arrow and Hawkman, for example), Peterson and Souders say that they have always grounded the show in a real place.
Another show that hopes to emphasize the humanity in the superhuman (without costumes as well) is ABC's new series "No Ordinary Family" (premiering September 28).
"The first season should feel like the first act of a superhero movie," said "Family" producer Zack Estrin.

Tim Kring, who created the NBC series "Heroes,"  certainly agrees about making the characters relatable.
Our characters really didn't live heightened lives and their world didn't have that kind of gothic-y look," he said.
NBC has another series inspired by comic books on the horizon, and its main character also has an intriguing backstory.

He's quite suited for the role, having had a hand in the TV series "Lost" and "Heroes."
It may have had an overriding arc, but it was more of the emotional arcs that we were following," he said.

So, for an up-and-coming series like "The Cape," the villains were seen as extremely important.
"I want to create a classic 'rogues gallery' like Spider-Man or Batman's," said series creator Thomas Wheeler.

When asked to share advice for producers of superhero programs like Wheeler, Estrin and Feldman, "Heroes'" Kring said, "My advice would be stay away from time travel."
I'm just fascinated to see how these new shows explore the genre."
