Earlier Friday, the country's tourism minister said on Al Hayat Egyptian TV that authorities had located the kidnappers and were negotiating with them.
A group of armed Bedouins had blocked the road on which they were traveling.
The hostages were released after a day, the news agency said, after Egyptian authorities intervened.
Eid revealed news of the kidnapping of his family, during an interview with CNN about the rampage in a Port Said football stadium that left at least 79 people dead.
He declined to explain how the children were returned to their parents.
