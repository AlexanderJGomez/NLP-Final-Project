Until the boy made his way inside the ramshackle house in Dayton, Ohio, on Sunday, neighbors didn't think anyone lived there, said Ken Betz, director of the Montgomery County Coroner's Office.
Inside, however, was the body of Edward Brunton, who hanged himself with a belt in a closet in 2009, according to Betz.
He also was estranged from his family and friends, thus no one ever reported him missing, Betz said.
The boy's mother, Michelle McGrath, went into the house to investigate.
Authorities found identification documents on Brunton's body.
