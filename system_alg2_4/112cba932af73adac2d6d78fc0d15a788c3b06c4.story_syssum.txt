Canada has decided to shut down its side of the Whitetail, Montana, border crossing next year because fewer than five vehicles a day use the crossing.
The Department of Homeland Security has stressed the need for spending tens of millions of dollars in Montana to improve security along the border.
Rehberg has asked Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to once again review the plan to spend $8.5 million dollars on the border crossing, adding that its his job as a congressman to "safeguard tax dollars, and I'm making sure this boondoggle doesn't slip through the cracks."
"A year ago, unilateral plans to close the Canadian side weren't part of the equation," Tester spokeswoman Andrea Heller told CNN.
Last year after CNN aired a report showing how little the state's border stations were used, the Department of Homeland Security announced it would review its plans.
It is not clear if anyone at Homeland Security discussed Canada's plans as part of that review.
