Warner Bros.' new baseball drama 42 topped the box office with $27.3 million — far ahead of recent baseball titles like Moneyball ($19.5 million debut) and Trouble with the Curve ($12.2 million).
In fact, 42 scored the best ever debut for a baseball film, surpassing The Benchwarmers' $19.7 million bow.
Like fellow "A+" films The Help and The Blind Side, which also deal with racial issues, 42 should earn a terrific multiplier and finish well above $100 million.
Part of the reason for Scary Movie 5's sub-par performance may have to do with the fact that it arrived in theaters a full seven years after Scary Movie 4, which earned $40.2 million in its opening weekend in 2006.
That's quite a long break for a youth-targeting franchise like Scary Movie.
The $135 million caveman comedy has now earned $142.5 million domestically, and may finish its run with about $180 million.
