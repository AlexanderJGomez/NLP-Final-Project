Washington (CNN) -- A divided federal appeals court has ruled that federal regulators went too far with new rules to control air pollution in parts of the eastern United States.
A number of states and power companies had sued over the July 2011 rule limiting power plant emissions in 28 "upwind" states.
"EPA faults the states for not hitting that impossible-to-know target with their (State Implementation Plans) submissions," Kavanaugh said.
Under the Clean Air Act, the good neighbor provision requires upwind states to bear responsibility for what the appeals court said was their fair share of "the mess" in downwind states.
"This decision allows harmful power plant air pollution to continue to aggravate major health problems and foul up our air.
But Texas was among those states critical of the administration's new rules.
The federal government now has the option now of asking the Supreme Court to accept the case for review.
The case decided Tuesday is EME Homer City Generation LP v. EPA (11-1302).
