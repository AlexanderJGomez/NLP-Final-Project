New York (CNN) -- A former Army sergeant is facing conspiracy charges in a federal sting operation that focused on a team he allegedly supervised in what the team thought was international drug trafficking and planned killings, according to the U.S. attorney in Manhattan.
Hunter, Vamvakias and Gogel are each charged with separate counts of conspiracy to murder a law enforcement agent, conspiracy to kill a person to prevent communications to law enforcement, conspiracy to import cocaine into the United States, and other drug and gun related charges, according to federal documents.
Hunter recruited a team of four individuals to assist the "drug traffickers" he had met, collecting his alleged team members' resumes via e-mail, the indictment said.
The men Hunter thought were Colombian traffickers "were in fact confidential sources for the DEA," according to the indictment.
There are references to talks among the alleged team members about "bonus work," which Hunter explained meant assassinations, the indictment said.
But the indictment did not elaborate on those purported killings or say where or when they supposedly took place.
The group's work with the confidential informants took them to Thailand, where in late March, according to the indictment, the team provided "counter-surveillance" to make sure local officials did not know about boats that were being loaded with what team members believed to be cocaine.
Hunter was arrested in Thailand and was expected to arrive in New York on Friday evening.
According to the indictment, Hunter served in the U.S. Army from 1983 to 2004, attaining the rank of sergeant first class.
