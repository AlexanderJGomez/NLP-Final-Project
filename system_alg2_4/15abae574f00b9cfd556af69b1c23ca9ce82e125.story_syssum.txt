(CNN) -- David Wallechinsky didn't invent what's on the Internet.
"The Book of Lists" immediately took its place on another list -- the bestseller list -- and spawned three sequels.
"I was thrilled when the Internet came around," he says.
He understands that the list concept makes it easier to process information, and "I'm glad to have done what I could."
CNN spoke to Wallechinsky about lists, government and finding himself referenced on Wikipedia.
David Wallechinsky: Oh, sure.
Wallechinsky: I think we live in an era of over-stimulation -- too much information -- so lists are a way of grasping that information.
I think the best lists are the ones you can't just look up -- you have to really think about and research.
Wallechinsky: No, not really.
My father and I had compiled a book, "The People's Almanac," and one of the chapters was lists, just list-lists.
Wallechinsky: Oh, sure.
4.
I just want to see the list on one page.
Something like 95% of what the government did doesn't get covered.
So I made this list of more than 300 agencies in the U.S. government, their budget, how many people they employ and that's how I got the idea for AllGov.
CNN: The Internet is supposed to be the great leveler, now that there's all this information out there.
Wallechinsky: You started to see that with the introduction of cable television.
The Internet is just an extension of that.
Wallechinsky: I haven't looked in the last year or two, but at one point on Wikipedia it actually mentioned that either "The People's Almanac" or "The Book of Lists" was the progenitor of the Internet.
