The investigation into the actions of former NFL tight end Aaron Hernandez, who is accused of killing friend Odin Lloyd, has turned to Hernandez's fiancee as law enforcement searches for the .45 caliber gun used in the slaying.
Shayanna Jenkins has not been charged in connection with the investigation, and lawyers representing her fianc√©, Hernandez, have not responded to requests for comment.
The day after Lloyd's body was found, Shaneah Jenkins told authorities she was with her sister, Shayanna, and two uncles at Hernandez's home.
During that time, Shaneah Jenkins said she saw her sister go into the basement with an empty trash bag.
About an hour later, a home surveillance video shows Jenkins leaving the house carrying something "rigid" and "consistent to a lock box or safe" placed inside a garbage bag and covered with clothing, according to the documents.
Singleton, Hernandez' cousin, remained jailed on a contempt of court charge for failing to cooperate with a grand jury, according to two law enforcement sources.
