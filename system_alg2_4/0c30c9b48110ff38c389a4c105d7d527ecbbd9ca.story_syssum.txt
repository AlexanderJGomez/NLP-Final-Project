(CNN)An Arizona prison teacher who said she was raped by an inmate is at the center of a legal controversy in which the state is accused of trying to dismiss her negligence lawsuit on the grounds of "it's a prison, this will happen," her attorney contends.
"No, seriously.
A federal judge on Monday heard arguments from the teacher's attorneys and the Attorney General's Office on the state's request to dismiss the teacher's lawsuit.
The controversy focuses on statements that Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Weisbard wrote in a December 19 motion to dismiss the teacher's lawsuit against the state, the warden of the Arizona State Prison Complex -- Eyman, and other prison personnel.
The teacher has been distressed by the state's effort to dismiss her case, according to Zwillinger, her attorney.
"It feels like 1952 is what it feels like.
This is not the victim's fault.
The inmate, Jacob Harvey, now 21, is charged with rape, assault and other charges in a January 30, 2014, attack on the teacher at Eyman prison in Florence, and he has pleaded not guilty.
On that January 2014 morning, the teacher was administering a pre-GED High School Equivalency test to six or seven inmates, including Harvey, court papers said.
The prison gave the teacher a radio to use in case an inmate "acted up," the suit said.
Harvey asked the teacher if he could use the bathroom, located outside the classroom, but after the teacher got up from her desk, Harvey grabbed her from behind, pushed her to the ground and stabbed her multiple times in the head and hands with a pen, the suit said.
The state also argued that the teacher "has attempted to recast absolutely routine prison events," court papers said.
"After being moved from the visitation room and during the approximate 1Â½ hours (the teacher) administered the pre-GED exam in Classroom Two, not a single corrections officer entered the classroom to perform a security check on the inmates and the welfare of (the teacher)," the lawsuit said.
