Seoul (CNN) -- Everyone's made a joke they thought was funny only to see it fall flat, but Park Jung-geun's attempt at humor could see him jailed for up to seven years in South Korea.
His supporters then doctored a North Korean military poster, replacing a smiling soldier with a sad photo of Park and the image of the gun with another whiskey bottle.
"To be honest, if you did this in North Korea, you would be severely punished," Park said.
Used widely during the years of military dictatorship in the 1970s and '80s, the law was designed to protect the state against North Korean propaganda and to prosecute spies.
It should be reformed in line with human rights law and if the government cannot do this, it must be abolished," he said.
President Lee Myung-bak's office declined to comment on the issue but the law has certainly been more widely used since the conservative president came to power in 2008.
"President Lee Myung-bak has appointed pro-government people as presidents of the media companies, what we call 'parachutes,'' said Kim Jong-wook, head of the YTN labor union which is still on strike.
The government denies interference but picketing journalists say they are worried they are seeing increased censorship reminiscent of the dark days of dictatorship.
