In times past, a president has usually risen to the demands of leadership when a Congress has stubbornly resisted tough choices, such as the upcoming mandatory budget cuts that are called sequestration.
People forget how hostile House Republicans were to Clinton -- hell, they impeached him -- but he nonetheless worked with them to pass four straight balanced budgets and an overhaul of welfare.
One of the foremost duties of Congress is to pass a budget: It has failed for four straight years.
Republicans, especially in the House, have continually refused to meet the White House halfway.
Fewer than one in five, or 18%, in the Post-Pew poll say they understand 'very well' what would happen if the sequester went into effect."
Perhaps, but in the meantime, the president and the Congress have one solemn and urgent responsibility: Having created this mess, they must -- stress must -- work together to minimize the disruptions and hardships that they are promising will happen.
Administration spokesmen say their hands are tied by the sequestration law because it requires even, across-the-board cuts.
The White House has made the argument that minimizing the effects would make people too complacent about what comes from reducing spending.
The concern about excessive power is legitimate, but surely a way can be found so that the White House and Congress would share power and any other arrangements be strictly limited in time.
But in the meantime, Obama and Congress have a duty to lead -- and that means to pass a bill that will minimize disruption and pain.
