Zhu Chun Yun lost her husband to cancer and now worries for her daughter's health.
"The doctor in the hospital told us not to live here," she told CNN through an interpreter.
Jingjing Zhang, an environmental lawyer who is working the villagers who want to sue the government, said the Dabaoshan mine has been polluting the Hengshui River for decades.
The Chinese ministry of health reported that increased pollution has made cancer the leading cause of death in the country.
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the United States imported $4.1 billion worth of seafood and agricultural products from China in 2006.
CNN talked to the mine's director who acknowledged environmental issues with the mine, but said it wasn't a problem that could be solved overnight.
Zhang continues to build her case against the mine, trying to win compensation for medical testing, health care and damage to the village's rice crops.
Water tests from Huanan Agricultural University have concluded the Hengshui is indeed too toxic for any human use, in stark contrast to what Jingjing said the government told the villagers.
The government hopes to have a dramatically cleaner country by August, when it will be host to the Olympics.
"He didn't want to go to the hospital because he worried we didn't have enough money to bring up our daughter," she said.
