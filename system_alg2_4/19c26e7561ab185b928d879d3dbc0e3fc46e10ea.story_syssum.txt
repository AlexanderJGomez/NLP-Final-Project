NEW YORK (CNN) -- Russia invades Georgia and President Bush goes on vacation.
Sen. John McCain takes weekends off and limits his campaign events to one a day.
It occurs to me that John McCain is as intellectually shallow as our current president.
When asked what his Christian faith means to him, his answer was a one-liner.
Why not?
Why?
That was it.
Where are John McCain's writings exploring the vexing moral issues of our time?
?
And it shows over and over again whenever McCain is called upon to think on his feet.
The world we live in is too complex to entrust it to someone else whose idea of intellectual curiosity and grasp of foreign policy issues is to tell us he can look into Vladimir Putin's eyes and see into his soul.
George Bush's record as a student, military man, businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure.
I fear to the depth of my being that John McCain is just like him.
