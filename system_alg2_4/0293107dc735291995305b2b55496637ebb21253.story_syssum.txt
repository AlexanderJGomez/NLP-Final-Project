Oceanside, New York (CNN) -- Deployed to a volatile outpost in southern Afghanistan where U.S. Marines routinely face a mix of skirmishes and hidden explosives, Greg Buckley Jr. sensed that an attack was imminent.
"The guy turned around and said to Greg, 'We don't want you here.
"Greg said, 'I thought I was going to lose my mind,'" his father said.
"One of his superiors came over and had Greg apologize to the guy," said the elder Buckley.
I'm not going to come home."
"Out in the field?'
"It was only two days he had left there in Afghanistan," his father told CNN.
The gunman involved in Greg's death attacked from inside his outpost and killed two other fellow Marines, his dad said.
"It's not really day-by-day," said Greg's mother, Marina Buckley.
"It's more minute-by-minute."
