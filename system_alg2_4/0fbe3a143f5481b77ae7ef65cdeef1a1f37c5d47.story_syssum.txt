WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A federal judge on Tuesday set aside the conviction of Republican former Sen. Ted Stevens while excoriating the case's prosecutors.
In a dismissal motion filed Wednesday, the Justice Department acknowledged that Stevens was not given access to the notes taken by prosecutors during an April 2008 interview with Allen.
"When we were finally given [the notes], you might have thought my reaction would be to celebrate, do high-fives, that we were right," Brendan Sullivan, an attorney for Stevens, said Tuesday.
How could they do that?
In a statement read to the court Tuesday, Stevens said that his faith in the justice system had been restored.
Paul O'Brien, one of the new government attorneys assigned to the case, made no attempt to the justify the conduct of the previous prosecution team.
In issuing his ruling, Sullivan noted the Justice Department's investigation into potential misconduct by government prosecutors had gone on for six months with no result.
The judge previously had excoriated prosecutors during the trial and held the prosecution in contempt at one point.
"There's no way [Stevens] can just 'put this behind him' as some have suggested he should," Palin said in a statement released Tuesday.
