(CNN) -- A woman who has been in a vegetative state for nearly 17 years was transferred to a private clinic Tuesday where she is expected to die -- ending what has been a lengthy and controversial legal fight.
For years, her father has fought to have her feeding tube removed, saying it would be a dignified end to his daughter's life.
But although Englaro had cleared the last legal hurdle, the court's decision sparked a new fight to find a hospital or clinic that would take out Eluana's feeding tube.
Several clinics initially came forward to say they could do it, but the Italian health minister then issued a decree to remind them of their duty of care.
The case has been a controversial one in Italy, a heavily Catholic country where the Vatican has great influence.
The outline adheres to the Cassation Court's ruling, which required certain steps and conditions once Eluana's feeding tube is removed.
