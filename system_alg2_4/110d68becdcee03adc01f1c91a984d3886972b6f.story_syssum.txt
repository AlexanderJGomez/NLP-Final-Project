(CNN) -- In a few terrible seconds, teen star Justin Bieber made his attorney Roy Black's job a heck of a lot harder.
Justin Bieber should have just shut up.
That's right, it's the job of the state -- in this case, the state of Florida.
All Bieber had to do was shut his mouth.
It makes no sense why more defendants don't use this precious liberty.
Roy Black is NOT happy with his client right now.
However, the integrity of our justice system requires that every defendant get an opportunity to have his guilt or innocence determined according to the evidence against him.
By failing to perform the simple task of remaining silent, Bieber has done the exact thing Miranda rights are designed to prevent -- he has incriminated himself.
Unless you want to attack the credibility of your own client, the defense lawyer is in an awful position.
Remember, you have that right.
