Manchester United defender Evra accused his Liverpool opponent of racially abusing him during Saturday's 1-1 Premier League draw, and the English Football Association said it would investigate after match referee Andre Marriner reported the incident.
It is not something we would want to level against Liverpool, and it is not against Liverpool.
United and Liverpool are bitter rivals, and Ferguson appealed to both sets of fans before the match at Anfield, asking them not to sing abusive chants about the clubs' respective tragedies in Munich and Hillsborough.
Both sets of fans were good," Ferguson said.
Maybe this is what surprised Patrice Evra.
Ferguson said Evra would be in contention to play in Romania, with last season's Champions League finalists United seeking to kickstart a faltering European campaign after picking up just two points from two Group C matches.
Rooney started on the bench against Liverpool following the news that he will be banned for all three of England's Euro 2012 finals group matches after his red card against Montenegro.
None of us did," Ferguson said.
Nine-time European champions Real Madrid will seek a third successive Group D victory at home to French side Lyon in the clubs' ninth meeting in six years.
