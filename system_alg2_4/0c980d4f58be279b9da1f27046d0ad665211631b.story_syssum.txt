The advent of Bitcoin ATMs is seen as a step towards bringing the digital currency into the real world.
"It removes all the pain and barriers of entry to buying Bitcoin on an online exchange," said Robocoin chief executive Jordan Kelley.
Let's say you want to make a withdrawal from your Bitcoin wallet.
Following a confirmation from the Bitcoin network to your phone, you can then scan the code on the receipt at the kiosk, which then prompts the ATM to spit out the allotted amount of cash.
Kelley said the company has already sold 50 ATMs to other operators worldwide but they are not yet in operation.
The installation of Robocoin Bitcoin ATMs will be prohibited said Tseng Ming-chung, FSC chairman in an interview with Taiwan's Central News Agency.
Despite the setback, Robocoin's chief executive said he still firmly believes China will come to accept Bitcoin.
Kelley revealed that Robocoin has begun talks with several operators in China that are reaching out to the government and local regulators to "educate" them about the value and potential of the Bitcoin market.
