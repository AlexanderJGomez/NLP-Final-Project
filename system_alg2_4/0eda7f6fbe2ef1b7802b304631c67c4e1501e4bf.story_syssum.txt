Millvina Dean, 97, is trying to raise money so she can stay in the nursing home she prefers.
Among the items going under the hammer at Henry Aldridge & Son is a canvas bag that might have been used to lift the infant Dean from a lifeboat to a rescue ship, said Alan Aldridge of the auction house.
Given that the auctioneer cannot prove Dean was rescued in the bag, "we expect it to fetch £3,000 ($4,480).
Aldridge said he was eager to raise as much for Dean as possible.
She's paying £3,000 a month in nursing home fees," he said -- the amount he hopes her canvas bag will sell for.
Dean's previous sale, in October, raised just over £30,000, Aldridge said.
"If she's lucky, she'll get another four or five years; she's quite a fit lady," he said.
The auction, in Devizes, southwest England, will also include a collection of letters from the estate of Titanic survivor Barbara Dainton-West, estimated to fetch £40,000 to £60,000 ($60,000 to $90,000).
