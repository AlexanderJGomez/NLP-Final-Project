The British aren't coming!"
The result of the emergency meeting has been described in the press as a humiliating defeat for both UK Prime Minister David Cameron and Obama.
Russia's weekly newspaper the Moscow News says the debate is "a stunning defeat" for Cameron.
The paper also suggests pushing for diplomatic instead of military resolutions.
UK's daily newspaper The Independent said Cameron's military plans were "shot down in a dramatic Commons vote" and that "foreign policy is in disarray."
British tabloid newspaper The Mirror also claims that UK politicians cannot pin Damascus on a map.
French news outlet France 24 expresses shock at the result of the vote, claiming that the nation's President Francois Hollande will maintain his firm stance in support of military intervention.
Unlike in the UK, the French leader does not need a vote in parliament to back his actions.
However, unlike the uncertain grounds of that war, the paper points to the strong evidence of the use of chemical weapons.
