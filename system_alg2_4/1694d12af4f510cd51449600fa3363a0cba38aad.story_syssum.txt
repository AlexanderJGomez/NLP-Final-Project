But folks in Mingo County are about to get a whole lot closer to Crum, who was appointed sheriff Thursday by the county's commissioners.
"She's a good person," Crawford said about Crum.
"They have been a pillar in the community and done everything that they felt was the right thing to do, and we feel this is the right thing for us to do," Baisden said about Crum's appointment.
John Mark Hubbard, president of the Mingo County Commission, said Crum's appointment is like an extension of her husband's legacy.
Crum was sworn in as sheriff on Thursday night at the county courthouse, just blocks from where her husband was shot.
She lost her husband, and would have lost a paycheck," he said.
She holds a paintbrush in one picture -- a dog, a baby and her husband tight in others.
Justin Marcum, an assistant prosecutor in Mingo County, said having Crum step into her husband's shoes should help in the healing process.
