(CNN) -- When I won the reality show competition "Survivor: Africa" in 2001, I never dreamed that an obscure African flower would provide the drug that later helped me survive cancer.
Now I'm working hard to protect natural areas that will provide the source of future drugs that could save millions of lives.
I won $1 million and the confidence that I could survive just about any challenge.
But as they worked I found some comfort when I learned that one of them was derived from an African flower, the rosy periwinkle.
My cancer is now in remission and once again I owe my survival to working with nature.
According to a recent study, natural drugs and related products are used to treat 87 percent of all known diseases, including cancer, heart disease, diabetes and HIV.
The first antiviral medication approved for the treatment of HIV/AIDS came from a marine sponge, yet marine habitats around the world are threatened by pollution, overfishing and climate change.
According to the World Conservation Union, more than 16,000 species, plant and animal alike, are in danger of extinction, largely because of human activities.
I won "Survivor: Africa," and I've won my battle against cancer.
The rosy periwinkle saved my life.
