Washington (CNN) -- In what one member of Congress called "a charade," a couple that showed up at President Obama's first state dinner -- uninvited, the White House claims -- declined to answer questions surrounding the event before a House committee Wednesday.
"The Constitution protects fools," Lungren said.
The Constitution protects errant thought.
"I think today's procedure is a charade," Rep. Mark Souder, R-Indiana, said in the hearing, referring to the Salahis' refusal to answer questions.
"Were you there?"
Salahi's wife, Michaele, also invoked her Fifth Amendment right under questioning by committee members, but replied, "yes," when asked if she would return to testify after the investigation has concluded.
The Salahis contend they were told they could attend the program to honor India's prime minister, but the White House says they were not invited and were not on the guest list for the exclusive affair.
"Whatever the real story is, it's on the other side of the gates of the White House, not with the Salahis," Best said.

There also was criticism of the White House in Wednesday's hearing.
"I don't know what the White House is trying to hide," King said.
"They are Americans," he said.
"They are proud Americans."
