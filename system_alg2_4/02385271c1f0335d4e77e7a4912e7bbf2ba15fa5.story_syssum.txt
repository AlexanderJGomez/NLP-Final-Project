The International Maritime Bureau say attacks off the east coast of Africa have increased this year.
A second attempted hijacking took place at approximately the same time, but the Italian-flagged cargo ship evaded the attack, the EU said.
Pirate attacks off the coast of east Africa have significantly increased this year, according to the International Maritime Bureau, which monitors shipping crimes.
More than half of this year's attacks were carried out by suspected Somali pirates off the east coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, a major shipping route between Yemen and Somalia.
The pirates appeared to be heading toward Somalia, the European Union Naval Force said.
The bulk carrier De Xin Hai is one of four ships that Somali pirates are holding for ransom with 80 crew members as hostages, the International Maritime Bureau said Wednesday.
That cargo is an easy target for robbers in countries that lack the resources to secure their shorelines, such as Somalia.
Piracy accelerated after the fall of the Somali government in the early 1990s and began to flourish after shipping companies started paying ransoms.
With the ransoms they collect, pirates can earn up to $40,000 a year, analysts say.
But at the same time, from the owner's point of view, there is no other way currently to secure the safe release of the vessel along with the crew and the cargo," Mody said.
