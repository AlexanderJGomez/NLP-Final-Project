From more than 10 stories up, I filmed the chaos.
Black smoke hung in the air.
I saw at least 20 wounded people carried away.

Three more had shattered through another window.

We were told that the priest had blessed the bodies even though people were still trying to find out who the victims were.
This happened just hours after the Ukraine government declared a truce in the fighting here that has shocked the world.
We were told later that in all 13 people had been rushed into this hotel, three of them clinging to life.
Outside, gunfire still rang out.
