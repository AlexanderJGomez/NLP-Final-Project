U.N. Security Council members on Wednesday unanimously approved a resolution to address the "growing threat" posed by foreign terrorist fighters, a measure that U.S. President Barack Obama applauded while insisting it "must be matched and translated into action" to have any effect.
But it will take more than corralling groups like ISIS militarily to permanently address the threat, Obama said.
Obama also said the world must do better at addressing root problems -- from economic insecurity and political instability, including in Syria, where he called for "a political solution" to the years-long civil war there -- that play a role in drawing some to join terrorist groups.
It's been with us for years," French President Francois Hollande said at the Security Council meeting.
In fact, officials from China and Russia -- two (of the five) Security Council permanent members who often stymy U.S. efforts at the United Nations, including those related to the Middle East -- assertively staked out anti-terrorist positions on Wednesday.
He also said any efforts must "address longstanding conflicts" like those between Palestinians and Israel.
"The United Nations and the Security Council have to play the leading role in the global war on terrorism," the Chinese minister said.
"I can promise you that the United States of America will not be distracted or deterred from what must be done," he said.
Today, I ask the world to join in this effort," the President said.
If Russia rolls back its involvement, the United States "will lift our sanctions and welcome Russia's role in addressing common challenges," Obama said.
"If the world acts together, we can make sure that all of our children can enjoy lives of opportunity and dignity."
Climate change:  The United States will work on the issue within its own borders, but "we can only succeed in combating climate change if we are joined in this effort by every major power," Obama said.
