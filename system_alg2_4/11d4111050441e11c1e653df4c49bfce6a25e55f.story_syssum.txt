The wireless giant announced a multibillion-dollar deal to purchase rights to largely unused spectrum, which is like an open lane on the congested wireless Internet highway.
The AT&T deal drew the wrath of the Justice Department and the FCC.
Unlike the proposed AT&T/T-Mobile merger, Verizon's acquisition doesn't involve taking millions of subscribers from a competitor, thereby increasing concentration in the wireless market.
If Washington were so inclined, it could free up a ton of spectrum for more valuable uses.
And it's an idea that has taken on greater urgency in recent years, both because of the proliferation of spectrum-hungry wireless devices -- smartphones and tablets -- and because Washington desperately seeks revenue.
So AT&T and Verizon, the No.
The upshot is that it's far from self-evident that AT&T would remain first in subscribers for long in a post-merger market.
And neither apparently puts much weight on AT&T's need for additional spectrum if it is to offer viable competition for Verizon in a 4G world.
If this were 1951 instead of 2011, when self-satisfied American megacompanies like GM set the pace for global industrial innovation, we'd have more sympathy for the government's tilt against market concentration.
The first is to limit what firms like Verizon and AT&T can do to improve their service offerings, slowing the rollout of 4G.
But it would mean a change in priorities at Justice and the FCC in which the agencies use their legal leverage to minimize concentration in regional wireless markets without undermining the potential for more efficient use of spectrum.
