(CNN)Searchers have found the tail section of AirAsia Flight QZ8501 in the murky depths of the Java Sea, raising hopes that the plane's black boxes and the precious information they hold might soon be recovered.
Finding the tail section is a potentially vital step in the investigation because that is where the flight data and voice recorders -- the so-called black boxes -- are located in the Airbus A320-200, the aircraft model of Flight QZ8501.
"If right part of tail section then the black box should be there."
In this case, officials hope it will contain any possible discussion of the crisis that eventually brought down the jet, Waldron said.
Soelistyo said Wednesday that divers were preparing to go back underwater in the same area, which is in one of the priority zones where search efforts have been focused.
"Elements are also still conducive for another search.
Soelistyo also said Wednesday that another body had been found in the sea, bringing the total to 40.
Many family members of the people on board the plane have been waiting in Surabaya for news of their loved ones.
The amount is in addition to $24,000 offered to families to help with immediate financial hardship.
