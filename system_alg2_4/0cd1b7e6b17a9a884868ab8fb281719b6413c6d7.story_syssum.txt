LONDON, England (CNN)  -- A veteran of over 20 years of mountain climbing, Dave Bunting has been in some pretty tight scrapes.
Faced with the fearsome power of nature mountaineers like Bunting rely on one indispensable ally -- other mountaineers.
To illustrate this point, when Bunting -- a warrant officer in the British Army -- was compiling a team of soldiers to attempt an ascent of Everest's notorious West Ridge the first quality he and the rest of the selection panel looked for was not climbing expertise, but compatibility.
Bunting, 40, led the expedition of 21 army mountaineers to Everest's West Ridge two years ago.
Much of this build-up involved establishing strong bonds between team members.
An essential factor on a mountain as significant as Everest, Bunting says.
"(On Everest) a lot of people are out for themselves completely," says Bunting.
He says this selfish streak is exacerbated by the fast turnover of commercial climbing expeditions, which often meet for the first time just a couple of weeks before a summit attempt, meaning there is little opportunity to build team morale.
There's a clip in the documentary of one of the lads breaking trail, every step up to his knees in snow, and you hear him say: 'Well, this is our job so we've got to get on with it.'
This clear-headed thinking meant his team braved one of the most dangerous climbs in the world and made it back down again, together.
