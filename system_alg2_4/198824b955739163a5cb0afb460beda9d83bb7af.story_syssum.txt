NASA researchers, publishing in the journal Planetary and Space Science, have demonstrated that this "club sandwich" phenomenon may be happening on Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system and a satellite of Jupiter.
"Its ocean is huge, with enormous pressures, so it was thought that dense ice had to form at the bottom of the ocean.
The oceans of Ganymede may have 25 times the volume of Earth's oceans, scientists said.
Vance and colleagues did not visit Ganymede, obviously, but they performed laboratory experiments here on Earth to simulate what would happen to ice and salty water on the Jupiter moon.
Because salt ions attract molecules of H2O, liquid water becomes denser when salt is added.
Vance and colleagues use Ice VI to refer to the most dense and heavy ice that Ganymede may have.
Senior author Christophe Sotin, also of NASA's JPL, said in a statement that the "sandwich" model reflects a stable state, but there are various reasons why the moon might not achieve this structure; it may even alternate between a "club sandwich" phase and a structure with fewer layers: light ice, ocean, high-pressure ice.
We may learn more about Ganymede and other moons with the potential of life through a space mission called Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, or JUICE.
It is scheduled to launch in 2022.
