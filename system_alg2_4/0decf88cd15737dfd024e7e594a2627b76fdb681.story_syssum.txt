Michael Mukasey said waterboarding is repugnant, but he stopped short of saying it was torture.
Mukasey told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that while he finds waterboarding personally "repugnant," he could not answer "hypothetical" questions about whether the technique amounts to torture.
But his confirmation was all but assured last week when two key Democratic senators said they will vote in favor of Mukasey despite the controversy.
Sources with knowledge of the CIA-run interrogation program have said waterboarding is not currently being used in its interrogations.
