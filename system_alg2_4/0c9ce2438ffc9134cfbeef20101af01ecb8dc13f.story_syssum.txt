Prosecutors said Phillipos lied to investigators about being in Tsarnaev's college dorm room at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth after the bombing.
After the verdict, U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said thousands of citizens assisted law enforcement in identifying and tracking down the suspects following one of the most significant events in Boston's modern history.
It is a crime to lie to law enforcement agents, and that is why Robel Phillipos was charged and why the jury found him guilty today.
"I don't believe that Robel Phillipos has ever been more angry at a person than he was at Dzhokhar Tsarnaev when Robel found out that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev did what he did in this case," Church said after the verdict.
According to court documents, Phillipos hadn't seen or talked to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev for at least two months before the bombing.
In July, a federal jury found another friend of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's guilty of obstructing the investigation into the attack.
Tazhayakov will be sentenced November 19.
Prosecutors said Phillipos repeatedly lied to investigators when he denied that he entered Tsarnaev's dormitory room and saw Kadyrbayev remove a backpack containing fireworks on the evening of April 18, 2013.
Later that night while Tazhayakov and Phillipos watched the manhunt for the Tsarnaevs on television, Kadyrbayev discussed getting rid of the backpack with the fireworks with them.
