Property prices are down.
But companies that interpret slower GDP growth to mean that business opportunities in China and other emerging markets will begin to fade are making a serious mistake.
China illustrates an important phenomenon found in many emerging markets.
Some of the sharpest consumption growth in China is occurring among the upper middle class, which we classify as households with annual disposable household incomes of $25,000 to $50,000.
At BCG, we have been tracking a particularly impressive group of hard-charging competitors that we refer to as "local dynamos" -- emerging market-based companies that are staying home and conquering their domestic markets.
They have averaged compound annual revenue growth of 28% annually over the past four years, compared with 5% annual growth among S&P 500 companies.
Home Inns & Hotels Management illustrates how Chinese dynamos can operate successfully while moving at warp speed.
With revenues of $1 billion in 2013, Home Inns controls nearly 25% of China's branded economy-hotel segment.
After just three years in operation, Xiaomi reached $5 billion in revenue in 2013 and sold more smartphones in China -- nearly 19 million -- than Apple.
A number of companies on BCG's 2014 list of "global challengers" -- fast-growing companies based in emerging markets that are becoming global leaders or have the potential to do so -- have followed the path of leveraging their dominance in domestic markets to go global.
