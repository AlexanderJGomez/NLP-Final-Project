Radamel Falcao Garcia Zarate, Falcao for short, is a Colombian soccer star.
Monday was European football's "transfer deadline day," the last opportunity for the continent's top teams to sign new players.
United is yet to win this season and recently suffered a humiliating 4-0 defeat to third division team MK Dons in the League Cup.
Simply put, United signing Falcao is like buying a really nice sweater but forgetting to put on your trousers.
A new star was born, and Rodriguez is now strutting his stuff at Real Madrid having also left Monaco.
As well as Falcao and Rodriguez, Mendes brokered the deal to bring Di Maria to Old Trafford and Eliaquim Mangala to Manchester City.
He's a big guy...
His dad Radamel Garcia was also a professional footballer, playing in Colombia, and he thinks his son is going all the way to the top.
Monaco did qualify for the Champions League, even if Falcao missed most of last season through injury.
The Manchester club isn't in Europe after an awful season under Alex Ferguson's successor David Moyes, who was subsequently sacked.
