A man arrested in connection with the stabbing deaths had been scheduled to appear before a judge Tuesday, but that appearance was pushed to Wednesday, according to the island's solicitor general, Taco Stein.
Autopsies were performed Monday on the couple, found stabbed to death in their St. Maarten home, the solicitor general said.
Identifying him only by his initials M.K.J., the St. Maarten Public Prosecutor's office described the suspect as a 28-year-old, Jamaican-born man.
The suspect's attorney, Brenda Brooks, said she met with her client Monday at a police station in St. Maarten's capital Philipsburg, where he is being held.
"Some things are missing" from the King's home, but there were no signs of a break-in, he said.
"They were beautiful people," he said, adding he is "still in shock."
