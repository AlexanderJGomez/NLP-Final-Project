Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Prominent retailers and clothing suppliers are scrambling to clarify their links to a garment factory in Bangladesh that caught fire over the weekend, killing more than 100 people.
The clothing factory, housed in a multistory building, caught fire Saturday night.
Li & Fung, a large trading company that supplies international retailers, said that it had placed orders worth more than $100,000 with the Tazreen factory this year for Kids Headquarters, part of its U.S. subsidiary.
Thousands of people from dozens of clothing factories in Ashulia took to the streets Monday to protest the way in which their colleagues died.
Li & Fung said it would carry out its own investigation.
The ILRF published a list of companies whose brand logos had been found on clothing and documents at the factory.
Even as Bangladesh prepared to mourn the deaths from the weekend fire, firefighters battled a blaze at another apparel factory near Dhaka on Monday.
Police and witnesses said the latest fire, at a 10-story clothing factory in the suburb of Uttara, began Monday morning, and firefighters took about four hours to bring it under control.
Bangladesh's ready-made garments make up 80% of the country's $24 billion in annual exports.
"How the factory caught fire, I don't know.
