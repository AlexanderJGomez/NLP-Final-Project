(RollingStone.com) -- Paul Reubens is dusting off his red bow-tie once more for a film revival of his iconic character Pee-wee Herman.
"Steven Spielberg?"
The script was written by Reubens and comedian Paul Rust â€” whose writing credits also include "Arrested Development" and "Comedy Bang!
After missing the final cut for the 1980 cast of "Saturday Night Live," Reubens adapted the eccentric character for the stage with "The Pee-wee Herman Show," which gained national exposure after being filmed and released by HBO as a 1981 special.
A film sequel, "Big Top Pee-wee," was released in 1988, though was a critical disaster and relative commercial flop.
In 2007, the actor appeared in character at Spike TV's Guy's Choice Awards, marking Pee-wee's first public appearance since 1992; then in 2011, Reubens appeared as Pee-wee in a "Saturday Night Live" segment opposite cast member Andy Samberg.
