(CNN) -- Frankel and Black Caviar.
Frankel is now rated as the best performer on the flat in the world by race statistics company Timeform -- which since 1948 has been using a mathematical equation comparing race results to the weight of the horse plus distance run to create a hierarchy which is used in many form guides for racegoers and owners.
"Frankel will have the pick of the best mares when it is time for him to stud, and there is no mare out there at the moment attracting as much attention as Black Caviar," says Johnny McKeever, who has 25 years of experience in buying horses which have gone on to win major Group One meets around the world.
And that initial stud fee is set to break the current world record held by Irish horse Sea The Stars, who earned nearly $7 million in prize money from a series of wins in major Group One races such as the Prix de L'Arc de Triomphe and the Epsom Derby.
Bloodstock valuations have come down from the crazy prices of a decade ago, when horses would sell for $10 million as purchasers found it difficult to secure a return on their investment with falling prize money at racecourses around the world.
"Ever since he was a three-year-old, Frankel has seemed determined to get better and better," Timeform's flat racing editor David Johnson told CNN.
Trainer Peter Moody is still undecided whether she will get a few more run-outs as part of a farewell tour of Australian courses, or whether June's Ascot appearance was her last race.
There is a feeling in the industry at the moment that, come the day Juddmonte decide to put him out to stud, they may want him to pair with mares already in their stable so they get to reap the rewards of whatever he will produce.
"At the end of the day there is no guarantee that Frankel and Black Caviar will take to each other.
They might not like one another, much like some humans are unlikely to mate," McKeever said.
