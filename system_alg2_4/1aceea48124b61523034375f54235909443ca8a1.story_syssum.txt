Chad Schaffner, 37, was arrested in Kingdom City, Missouri, about 2:45 p.m. Saturday, said Missouri State Highway Patrol radio operator Paula Price.
Lakey didn't know who Schaffner was at first, but said he felt something wasn't right after seeing Schaffner and his car, partly because Schaffner didn't make eye contact with him.
Schaffner faces charges including bank robbery in Tennessee; burglary in Indiana; armed robbery in Illinois; and receiving stolen property in Ohio, Price said.
Schaffner is suspected in 14 robberies of various types in six states, FBI Special Agent Brian Truchon told CNN on Sunday.
Schaffner was identified as a suspect last month after investigators posted surveillance photos from the robberies on electronic billboards throughout the South.
"This guy has made no effort to hide the gun," said FBI agent Kevin Keithley last month.
A woman in Morristown, Tennessee, also told authorities Schaffner hid in her apartment in August and threatened to kill her children if she revealed his whereabouts, according to documents filed in federal court.
Two bank robberies occurred in Morristown and Jefferson City, Tennessee, on August 18, authorities said.
He had threatened to kill the children if she told agents he was there, the woman said.
