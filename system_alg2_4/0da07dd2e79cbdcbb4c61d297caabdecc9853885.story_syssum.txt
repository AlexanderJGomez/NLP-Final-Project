Washington (CNN) -- Baseball all-time home run champion Barry Bonds won a big legal victory Friday when a federal appeals court ruled that evidence the government says would prove he lied about using steroids is inadmissible in court.
The Appeals Court ruling upholds a February 2009 ruling from U.S. District Judge Susan Illston that there was no proof that positive steroid tests from 2000 and 2001 were Bonds' and that out-of-court statements from his former trainer, Greg Anderson, are hearsay.
Anderson allegedly took urine samples and delivered them to a Bay-area lab known as BALCO.
The government said it would instead bring BALCO executive James Valente to the stand to testify Anderson told him the samples indeed came from Bonds.
The government had the burden of showing the samples came from Bonds, then went to Anderson and then to BALCO.
The dissent incorrectly assumes otherwise.
The government alleges BALCO helped supply Bonds with steroids and drug-masking substances.
The lab performed repeated tests on athletes, said the government, to check whether the drugs were detectable.
The case is U.S. v. Bonds (09-10079).
