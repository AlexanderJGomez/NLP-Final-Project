Richard and Mayumi Heene had met in a Hollywood acting school and pursued fame for their family in the world of reality TV, Larimer County Sheriff Jim Alderden said.
During the incident Thursday, as millions worldwide watched live TV coverage of the contraption floating above northern Colorado, authorities did not pick up on any deceptive behavior, Alderden said.

The plan included misleading the media on Friday when Alderden said authorities still believed the incident was not a hoax.
Alderden said that under Colorado law, authorities cannot announce whether polygraph tests were taken -- only that authorities pursued them.
Since authorities aren't required to share evidence until charges are actually filed, Lane said he could not lay out the Heenes' defense.
Authorities spoke with Mayumi Heene about domestic violence and the children's safety, Alderden said.
"But we didn't have enough that would allow us or Child Protection Services to physically take the kids from that environment."
Alderden said the boy may not have even been in the home.
The Heenes have previously appeared on the ABC program "Wife Swap."
The sheriff said investigators also want to interview 25-year-old researcher Robert Thomas who worked with Heene for about two months last spring.
