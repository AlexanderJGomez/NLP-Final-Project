Tyson's acceptance speech for best actress in a play was an emotional highlight of the American Theatre Wing's 67th annual Tony Awards broadcast live from New York's Radio City Music Hall.
Harris' opening number included scores of performers from current Broadway shows -- and a cameo by boxer Mike Tyson, who stars in his one-man show "Undisputed," singing and dancing in a white tux.
Harris ended the show with another trademark -- a closing "Tony hits lists" rap written as the show progressed.
One more great role, I said.
I just wanted one more, and it came to me with no effort on my part."
You wrapped me up in your arms after 30 years and now I can go home with a Tony."
"I want to thank Broadway."
"Kinky Boots" star Billy Porter won best actor in a musical for his role as a drag queen in a shoe factory.
While "Motown The Musical" lost out in all four categories for which it was nominated, the show likely gained fans with the musical medley performed by its cast during the Tony Awards.
