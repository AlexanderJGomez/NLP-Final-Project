Paul Embleton's BRAVE Foundation has trained more than 1,000 volunteer firefighters in Guatemala.
Veteran firefighter Paul Embleton witnessed such a rescue attempt in 1996 while on a medical mission trip to Guatemala -- and it moved him into action.
Embleton launched the BRAVE Foundation -- Bomberos Resourceful And Valiant Efforts -- to provide emergency response training and equipment to volunteer firefighters (bomberos) in Guatemala.

"I'd gone back to my hotel to try to think how I was going to teach with the same limited resources they had," Embleton said.
In 1998, with assistance from fellow Washington firefighters and Rotary International, the BRAVE Foundation established a pilot emergency medical training program in Guatemala City, using the U.S. emergency medical technician curriculum translated into Spanish.

"The firefighters have the motivation, and you get a heart for it because you see how well we have it in the States," Embleton said.
"You see all the good that it does," said Embleton.
