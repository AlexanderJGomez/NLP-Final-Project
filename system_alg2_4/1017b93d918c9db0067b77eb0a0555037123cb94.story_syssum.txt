Dickinson is the latest of a handful of women who have accused Cosby of sexual assault -- allegations the comedian has repeatedly said are untrue.
Cosby attorney Martin Singer called Dickinson's story "a lie" and said it contradicts her own autobiography and a 2002 interview she did with the New York Observer.
"That interview a dozen years ago said, 'she didn't want to go to bed with him and he blew her off,' " Singer's statement said Wednesday.
Bowman claims she was drugged, then raped, though she said she never saw drugs.
Bowman said she knew her body had been touched without her permission.
