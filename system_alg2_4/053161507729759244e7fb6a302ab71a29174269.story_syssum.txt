Furyk, 40, told the official website of PGA Tour that he set an alarm on his cell phone which ran out of power overnight and failed to wake him up.
After waking five minutes before he was due to start playing, Furyk made a dash from his hotel to the course but failed to get to the 11th tee of The Barclays tournament in New Jersey in time.
But I'm more upset because it's this one," Furyk added.
Slugger White, the Tour's vice president of rules and competition told the PGA Tour website: "It is unfortunate.
I am sure he will recover quite nicely next week and jump right in there again."
