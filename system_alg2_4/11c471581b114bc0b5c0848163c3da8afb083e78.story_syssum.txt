(CNN) -- The United Nations condemned an Iraqi raid on a camp housing Iranian dissidents north of Baghdad on Sunday, an attack that led to at least 15 deaths and allegations of more.
Iraqi health officials in nearby Baquba put the death toll from Sunday's raid at 15, with 30 others wounded.
But two officials with Iraq's Interior Ministry told CNN that security forces raided the camp after their base was hit by mortar rounds.
The officials said there were casualties from the raid, but they said they could provide no further details.
The U.N. Assistance Mission in Iraq said Sunday that only 100 members of the MEK remained at Camp Ashraf.
Sunday's clash at Camp Ashraf follows news that Iraq's internal strife killed 804 people and wounded more than 2,000 in August, according to the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq.
Sunni-Shiite frictions have escalated since an April incident in Hawija, in northern Iraq, where Iraqi security forces raided a site used by Sunni protesters to demonstrate against the Shiite-led government.
