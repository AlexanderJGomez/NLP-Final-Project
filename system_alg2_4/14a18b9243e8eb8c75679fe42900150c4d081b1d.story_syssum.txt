Addressing an audience of about 150 people at an Asian-American and Pacific Islander Ready for Hillary event, Tanden -- president of the Center for American Progress -- said she was looking forward to seeing everyone in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada.
It is going to be very exciting," Tanden said.
Tanden, who has worked with Clinton since 1997, is very close with the former first lady.
When Clinton ran for president, Tanden served as policy director and adviser.
In the past two months, the former first lady has hired a number of top staffers and been meeting with advisers to chat out a strategic course for a presidential run.
Tanden has not said whether or not she would leave the think-tank and join the likely Clinton campaign.
