Contaminated jalapeño and serrano peppers, grown in Mexico, are no longer in circulation, the FDA said.
The FDA said the contaminated jalapeño and serrano peppers, grown in Mexico, were no longer in circulation and said Thursday that it was lifting its advice to avoid eating raw jalapeño and serrano peppers grown, harvested or packed in Mexico.
At least 286 people were hospitalized from the salmonella Saintpaul strain, which began in April, and it may have contributed to two deaths, Tauxe said.
They found contaminated serrano peppers and irrigation systems at another farm in that same region.
"If you've got salmonella Saintpaul in a water supply on a farm, you've got to ask the question about how it got into the water, whether it was connected to canal systems -- the irrigation systems could have caused that contamination to go elsewhere," he said.
