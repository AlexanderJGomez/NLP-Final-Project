(CNN) -- If anyone deserved the death penalty, it was Clayton Lockett.
On Tuesday night, Lockett was scheduled to die by lethal injection -- the preferred means for executing criminals in states that allow for the death penalty.
Instead of putting Lockett to sleep and stopping his heart, the administration of the lethal injection caused his vein to burst, and about 45 minutes later, he died of a heart attack.
Like I said, if anyone deserved the death penalty, it was Lockett, but the real debate is whether we need to be in the business of trying to find the least cruel and least unusual way to kill anyone voluntarily.
Not at all.
In Lockett's case, this process took nearly 14 years.
Even with this long process of appeals, our system is far from perfect.
And the burden of the appeals process on the criminal justice system is huge.
It would be worth the price, if that was what it took to get justice.
But is the death penalty justice?
I've tried death penalty cases, and I've been lucky: None of my clients has ever been sent to death row.
You may be surprised to know that in many death penalty cases, which last for years, defense lawyers get to know victims' families.
We should not spend ever-dwindling resources figuring out ways to kill.
