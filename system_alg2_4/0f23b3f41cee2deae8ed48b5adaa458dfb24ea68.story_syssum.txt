Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Supporters and members of the gay and lesbian community in Kenya blasted the country's prime minister Monday after he said anyone engaging in homosexual activity should be arrested.
"If we find a man engaging in homosexuality or a woman in lesbianism, we'll arrest them and put them in jail," Odinga said.
The group insisted they were trying to "flush out the gays," according to a Human Rights Watch report.
Lawrence Mute of the Kenya National Human Rights Commission says that the prime minister's comments unwisely encourage hate crimes based on assumed sexuality.
