Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Lebanese military forces battled militants in Tripoli on Saturday, resulting in the deaths of two militants and two civilians, the Lebanese army said.
The militants are said to feel marginalized by the Lebanese army, which is heavily allied with Shiite Hezbollah.
Fighting continues in the nearby Al Muhammara area and the Sunni neighborhood of Bab al-Tabbaneh, security officials said.
The fighting started Friday when soldiers carried out a security campaign targeting the militants.
At the same time, the state-run National News Agency reported that security personnel have raided a guardhouse at the home of Khaled al Daher, a Sunni member of Parliament from Tripoli, and confiscated four rifles.
