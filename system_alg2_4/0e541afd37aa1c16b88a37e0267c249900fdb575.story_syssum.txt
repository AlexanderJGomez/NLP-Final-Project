(CNN) -- Canadian explorer Adam Shoalts knew he was heading into uncharted territory when he set out on a solo expedition to explore northeastern Canada's remote Again River.
Even Google Earth's low-resolution satellite imagery, all that's available for this remote part of Canada, is deficient for detecting waterfalls.
"I knew there would be lots of whitewater rapids, but no one knew that waterfalls existed on the river."
The first waterfall Shoalts found -- before it was too late to go around it -- was 20-feet high.
"My first thought when I realized I was being swept over a waterfall was, 'Wow!
He resurfaced, out of breath, and spotted his canoe upside down in an eddy near the riverbank.
This week, Shoalts is heading back to the Again River to continue his work for the Royal Canadian Geographical Society (RCGS).
"This expedition is geographical exploration in the truest sense: Shoalts's work will change the map of Canada -- a rarity in 21st century exploration," says the RCGS.
Though Shoalts says gadgets are useful in the field, it's important not to rely on them completely.
"The age of exploration will never be truly over -- the oceans, caves, Antarctica, so much of northern Canada -- it will take a long time to explore," he says.
