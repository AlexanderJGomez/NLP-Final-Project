Getting the baby to sleep is a challenge for many parents.
2:15 a.m. Jack (1 month) is sleeping between me and my wife because this way she can nurse while she dozes.
We're trying to get Jack (9 months) to sleep through the night.
1:36 a.m. Jack (12 months) is sleeping in between us, again.
4:27 a.m.
I have to get up to drive my wife to New York, then turn around and drive back home with Jack, all on about three hours of sleep.
10:11 p.m. Jack (15 months and a week) is in his crib, alone and asleep.
12:02 a.m.
11:21 p.m. Jack (18 months and a week) is no longer sick, but now he's back in our bed, every night.
7 a.m.
Jack (2 years) is nestled into his mother's chest, perpendicular to us, with his feet lodged against my throat, trying to push me off the bed.
I pull the covers up.
2:15 p.m.
7:30 p.m.
12:05 a.m.
5:02 a.m.
I get back into bed with my wife and snuggle up next to her.
I miss getting kicked in the throat.
9:42 p.m.
We lie down with him, three of us in a twin bed.
This is my family.
