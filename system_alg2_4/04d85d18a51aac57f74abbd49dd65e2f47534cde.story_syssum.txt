Los Angeles (CNN) -- Broadcast icon Dick Clark, the longtime host of the influential "American Bandstand," has died, publicist Paul Shefrin said.
Clark anguished each year over whether to continue appearing on the annual show because of limitations on his speech from the stroke, U.S. Rep. David Dreier, a longtime friend, told CNN Wednesday.
Clark's "American Bandstand" work, which he began when it was a local TV show in Philadelphia in 1956, earned him the nickname "America's oldest living teenager."
Entertainers told CNN on Wednesday that Clark knew that music transcends race.
When I joined his show in 2006, it was a dream come true to work with him every New Year's Eve for the last six years."
Clark became wealthy as a businessman, producing successful TV shows through Dick Clark Productions.
"One of the real draws when we purchased Dick Clark Productions was the opportunity to build on the tremendous foundation of programming that this icon of American broadcasting created," Snyder said Wednesday.
Born Richard Wagstaff Clark in Mount Vernon, New York, on November 30, 1929, he began his broadcast career working at a radio station managed by his father.
"He helped me from the very bottom of my career all through the '80s and the '90s, and he's going to be missed a lot."
And Dick Clark was a legend."
He was 75.
