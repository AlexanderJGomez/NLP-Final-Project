Jay Inslee said he is suspending executions while he is in office, meaning he will issue reprieves when any capital cases come to his desk for action.
And in death penalty cases, I'm not convinced equal justice is being served," the first-term Democratic governor said.
The governor's executive action will not definitively end future use of capital punishment in Washington -- that would take action from the legislature or voters -- nor will death row sentences automatically be commuted or pardons issued.
Inslee said his action had nothing to do with mercy.
"I don't question their guilt or the gravity of their crimes.
Nowhere are disparities between black and white inmates in criminal justice more apparent than in sentences deciding who lives and who dies," said Gerald Hankerson, the president of the Alaska, Oregon, and Washington State Area Conference of the NAACP.
Among them was Oregon in 2011.
Both of Oregon's executions since the Supreme Court allowed the death penalty to resume in 1976 happened during Kitzhaber's first administration as governor, from 1995-2003.
