Hernandez was a member of the Texas National Guard, officials said Thursday.
The El Paso, Texas, resident, 22, had been in the Guard since 2007.
Ciudad Juarez is in the Mexican state of Chihuahua and shares a border with El Paso.
Because of the violence, Juarez is considered off-limits for the U.S. military.
A second person, Rafael Ramirez Reza, 22, originally from Juarez, was also killed, said Carlos Gonzalez, spokesman for the Chihuahua Attorney General's office.
