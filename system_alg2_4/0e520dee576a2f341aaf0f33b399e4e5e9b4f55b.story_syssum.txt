(CNN) -- Soccer mom Meleanie Hain, who made national headlines last year by having a loaded, holstered handgun at her 5-year-old daughter's soccer game, has been found shot dead in her home along with her husband, police said Thursday.
Daniel Wright said.
Meleanie Hain's attorney, Matthew B. Weisberg, said she told him a few months ago that she and her husband were separating.
It was not immediately clear whether they were still living together.
"I'm still shaking."
Days later, on September 20, her permit to carry a gun was revoked by Lebanon County Sheriff Michael DeLeo, who claimed that she showed poor judgment at the child's game.
Although Weisberg called the Hains a "loving" and "unified" couple, he said that about four months ago, Meleanie Hain told him that they were separating and that she wanted to remove his name from the $1 million lawsuit.
"And sadly ironic."
