"Due to a misunderstanding on our part, earlier (Friday) we inadvertently issued a video link that had been sent for our perusal," according to a statement from Israel's Government Press Office, which distributed the link to media outlets.
The video, titled "We Con the World" -- set to the tune of the 1985 hit, "We are the World"-- was put together by Caroline Glick, a former member of the Israel Defense Forces and columnist for the Jerusalem Post.
Israel said the passengers initiated the attack; the passengers blamed the troops.
Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev dismissed the the video link, saying, "The GPO sends out lots of articles.
"It is what Israelis feel.
It was not the first time the Israeli GPO stirred controversy with its public communications on the Gaza flotilla.
The e-mail drew criticism from the foreign press and pro-Palestinian activists.
