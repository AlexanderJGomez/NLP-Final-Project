She wants to go to the cool dress-up party â€” her idea of a great costume is Ruth Bader Ginsberg â€” with her shallow bff (Jane Levy).
But when her pathetic widowed mother (Chelsea Handler) pawns her devilish little brother on her so she can party like a teenager herself, chaos and coincidences ensue.
Handler, on the other hand, looks literally pained, and fans of the talented comedian will wonder why she's already taking thankless mom roles after films like Bridesmaids proved a market for brassy female-driven comedies.
