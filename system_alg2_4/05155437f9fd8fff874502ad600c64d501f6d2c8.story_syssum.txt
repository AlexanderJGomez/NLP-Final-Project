The American twice won gold in the 100 meters, the Olympic blue riband event, but he arguably achieved more in the long jump, a discipline in which he was unbeaten in all competition for a decade and won four straight Olympic gold medals between 1984 and 1996.
He also won gold in the 200 meters and as part of the U.S. 4x100 meters relay team.
The 1988 Games in Seoul, South Korea, were billed as a showdown between Lewis and Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson who had won the 100 meters at the 1987 world championships in a world record 9.83 seconds.
Lewis also earned his eighth career gold by anchoring the U.S. relay team's victory in the 4x100 meters.
The 1996 Games in Atlanta should have been no more than a farewell appearance in an Olympic career that had also begun on home soil.
