Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The death toll climbed to 50 on Friday after a pair of suicide bombers detonated their explosive vests at one of Pakistan's holiest shrines, police said.

As such, they have been targeted by Islamic extremists.
"It is a matter of grave concern that despite repeated official claims of breaking the back of terrorists, they retain the ability to launch vicious terrorist attacks across the country almost at will," the commission said in a statement Friday.
