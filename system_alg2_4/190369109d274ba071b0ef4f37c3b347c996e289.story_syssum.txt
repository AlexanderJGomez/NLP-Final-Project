Last month, HollaBack, an international movement dedicated to "developing innovative strategies to ensure equal access to public spaces," released a hidden camera video of Shoshana Roberts walking down the streets of New York City, just minding her own business.
This was not the first time such an attack was mounted against a woman advocating for gender equality.
But almost before this speech could be digested, a website featuring a timer was created to count down the hours and minutes until naked images of Watson would supposedly be released.
These threats are not just happening to high profile women, but to women and girls everywhere.
It's happening to celebrity women advocating for gender equality.
It is a hate crime against women.
When such hate-fueled acts are targeted specifically at another historically oppressed group in our society, then they are seen for what they are, a hate-based violation.
This is, of course, is just one aspect of the war on women, but it is one of the most insidious and damaging.
It is time for the silencing of women stop.
