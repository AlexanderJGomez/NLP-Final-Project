Damascus, Syria (CNN) -- At a funeral for a Syrian man allegedly killed by government forces, a grief-stricken sister wails uncontrollably.
...
(President) Bashar al-Assad is responsible.
Why?
He said the defiance here is possible because of the presence of two orange-jacketed Arab League monitors on a fact-finding mission in Syria.
A banner emblazoned with al-Assad's image stretches across the street, and demonstrators wave Syrian flags and pictures of the president.
Demonstrators here say they trust the president.
If al-Assad is forced to go, "it will be chaos," the husband said.
"He is a peaceful president," his wife chimed in.
For now, al-Assad remains in control -- for the most part.
