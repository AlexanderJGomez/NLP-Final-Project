(CNN) -- A call to the Secret Witness tip line helped police break CNN's first featured cold case: the slaying of college student Brianna Denison, investigators say.
The arrest of James Michael Biela, 27, closes one chapter and opens another as the case moves from the investigative phase and into the courts.
And now, it is also our first cracked cold case.
Biela also was charged with first-degree kidnapping and sexual assault of a second young woman, a student at the University of Nevada, Reno.
Police say they were able to connect Biela's DNA with a sample left on panties found near Denison's body.
It also matched DNA found at the scene of a December 16 sexual assault, police maintain.
One of the previous victims was able to describe Biela's pickup, another key link in the evidentiary chain, according to investigators.
The investigation has now turned up gray fibers on one victim's clothing, said Detective Adam Wygnanski of the Reno Police Department.
It was an anonymous tip from a friend of his former girlfriend November 1 that broke this cold case wide open, police say.
Lab tests showed that the boy's father -- Biela -- was almost certainly a match for the DNA found on the doorknob and at the crime scene, police said.
When first questioned about the Denison case in early November, Biela refused to submit DNA samples and provided an alibi to police, claiming that he'd been with his girlfriend.
Meanwhile, investigators are certain there are other victims who just haven't come forward.
Police are urging anyone with more information to call the Reno Police Hot Line at 775-745-3521.
