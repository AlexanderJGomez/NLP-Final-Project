Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- There have been several points in my career as a producer and camera operator where I've realized that I have one of the best jobs in the world.
A friend showed me a clip of Johnny Knoxville getting shocked with a stun gun while hoisting an American flag, and I've been on board ever since.
By mid-morning of my first day onset, Steve-O had been launched hundreds of feet in the air and the crew -- along with maybe $1 million worth of 3-D camera equipment -- had been coated with a fine spray of human and animal waste.
I went from having the feeling that I had one the best jobs in the world to being pretty sure the cast and crew from Jackass had it all figured out.
