He recalls with fondness those childhood days when he used to race go-karts -- the precursor to his enormous success on the Formula One circuit -- free of any pressure.
Alonso admits he wants to have children of his own one day, but for now he is focused on trying to win more titles with arguably the most famous Formula One team in the world, the iconic "rosso corsa" of Ferrari.
"My father was the one to introduce the adrenaline and the passion for racing into the family," Alonso says.
I missed a lot of lessons and I needed to recover.
"I felt that this was a good moment and I would keep this trophy all my life because you never think that you will continue," says Alonso, a cycling enthusiast, too, who hopes to have his own team.
You never know.
In Alonso's case, plenty did come.
"It was just ready for the first race.
Despite not tallying a single point in 2001, Alonso caught the eye and soon moved to Renault, where in 2005 at the age of 24 he became F1's youngest world champion -- a record since beaten by Lewis Hamilton and reigning titleholder Sebastian Vettel.
"You arrive in Formula One, you win the world championship -- that's it.
"When I was 10 years old to 15 years old, in my room when I opened the door to get clothes, I had a photo of Ayrton with a car.
Like everyone else on the circuit, he has lagged behind Vettel since joining Ferrari in 2010, with the Red Bull driver claiming four consecutive titles.
"I think he's very talented so that is a huge help and huge motivation for myself first and also for the team because the team knows it has to deliver a good car because Kimi will deliver a good result," Alonso says.
I will tell you that two championships are more than I could dream of -- I never thought I'd become a Formula One driver, I never thought I'd win one grand prix.
I am hungry for victories, hungry for success -- I will tell you that two championships are not enough."
