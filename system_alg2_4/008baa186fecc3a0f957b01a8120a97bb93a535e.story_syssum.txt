The woman involved -- Mandi Hamlin -- told reporters earlier Friday she was humiliated by last month's incident, in which she was forced to painfully remove the piercings behind a curtain as she heard snickers from male TSA officers nearby.
Hamlin and her lawyer, celebrity attorney Gloria Allred, said they want a public apology from the agency, as well as a guarantee that future passengers with piercings will be treated with dignity and respect.
Allred pointed out that TSA's Web site says passengers with piercings can undergo a pat-down inspection if they do not want to take their piercings out -- an option she said Hamlin was never offered.
Hamlin said she also has navel and ear piercings and has never set off a metal detector or been singled out for additional screening at an airport.
Hamlin told the officer she had nipple piercings, Allred said, and that officer called over another officer, who told her she would need to remove them.
Also, a small crowd of onlookers had started to gather.
The officers insisted that Hamlin remove the nipple rings, Allred said.
She eventually was taken to a private area behind a curtain to remove the piercings, Allred said.
"As Ms. Hamlin struggled to remove the piercing, behind the curtain she could hear a growing number of predominately male TSA officers snickering in the background," Allred said in the letter.
She offered to remove it, Allred said, but an officer told her it was not necessary because he could see it.
In a statement earlier Friday, the TSA said it "is well aware of terrorists' interest in hiding dangerous items in sensitive areas of the body.
"They should be respected just like everybody else."
"We hope that means they're going to jump on this and do something about it," she said.
Hamlin said she will continue to fly but will avoid the Lubbock airport.
