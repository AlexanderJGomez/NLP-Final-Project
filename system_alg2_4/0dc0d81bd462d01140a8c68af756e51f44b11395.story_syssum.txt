The story began in May 2009, when Mohammad Sohail of Shirley, New York, was closing his Shirley Express convenience store one night.
Unbeknownst to the man, Sohail never loads his gun.
Don't shoot me."
Sohail made the man pledge never to rob anybody ever again, then gave the man $40 and a loaf bread.
Both Mohammad Sohail and Suffolk County Police have no idea who the man is.
You are a great American," another reads.
But the envelope that arrived on Wednesday came as a surprise.
The typed letter begins, "You change My Life (sic)," and goes on to say that the man is sorry for his actions six months ago.
The letter says Sohail's acts inspired him to become a "True Muslim" and that his life has changed dramatically.
So now he is a good person in this community and I'm very glad for that.
