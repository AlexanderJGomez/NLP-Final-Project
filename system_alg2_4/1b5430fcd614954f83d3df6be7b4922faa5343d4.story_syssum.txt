Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- A federal judge in Georgia has been arrested on drug and weapons charges after federal agents say he bought drugs for a stripper with whom he was having an affair.
Before the sting that led to his arrest, he told her, "Let me pay him, because you've already got a record," the affidavit states.
"It's not a case of Judge Camp being a judge, it's a case of Judge Camp being a husband."
A Justice Department spokeswoman confirmed the next court appearance in the case has not yet been scheduled.
During the deal that led to his arrest, Camp carried at least two pistols, his arrest affidavit states.
According to the affidavit, Camp pocketed the drugs and told the undercover agent, "We'll call you again."
