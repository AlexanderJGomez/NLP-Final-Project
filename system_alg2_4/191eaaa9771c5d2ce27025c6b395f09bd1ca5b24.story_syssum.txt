When we think of terminal cancer patients, we don't imagine someone like Brittany Maynard.
Since revealing her plans on a website and in a column this week for CNN, the Oregon woman has become the new poster child for the "death with dignity" movement, which advocates that terminally ill patients be allowed to receive medication that will let them die on their own terms.
Since Oregon passed its Death with Dignity Act in 1997, fewer than 1% of its 752 doctor-assisted deaths have been people Maynard's age.
And that's not always the case."
"Because (Maynard) is young and vibrant and articulate, she has generated a lot of attention," said George Eighmey, a board member of the Death with Dignity National Center, which advocates for physician-assisted death for terminal patients.
Under Oregon's law, doctors treating "death with dignity" patients prescribe doses of barbiturates, Hedberg said.
But polls have shown that most Americans support having a say in how they die, especially if the process is described not as doctors helping a patient "commit suicide" but as ending a patient's life "by some painless means."
"When you push Americans to say, 'Do you want choice on this matter?'
I am not suicidal.
I do not want to die.
It has given me a sense of peace during a tumultuous time that otherwise would be dominated by fear, uncertainty and pain."
