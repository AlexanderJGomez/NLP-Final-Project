PC sales representatives at Bainaohui, one of Beijing's largest electronics retailers, say their merchandise is not pre-installed with Green Dam, a Web filtering software the government said was necessary to prevent children from viewing pornography and other harmful content.
Computer experts say manufacturers have not had enough time to pre-install new computers with the software -- which is one reason behind the government's delay.
Twenty-two chambers of commerce and trade groups made an appeal to Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao urging that he abandon the software mandate.
Domestically, Chinese Internet users are rallying against the government.
The Green Dam's developers say they've even received death threats.
Mok also questions the true intent of the Green Dam software.
Sharp criticism of the software partially stems from fears that the software will simply further strengthen the government's control and censorship of the media.
The government said it is simply providing the software free of charge, as a pre-installed file on computer hard drives or as a CD, to give users to choice to install the software.
Said Victor Gao, a former government functionary who now heads a policy think tank: "The government always has its own views, but whether they are able to execute it to the detail and push it through the country is another issue."
And what do they think of Green Dam?
