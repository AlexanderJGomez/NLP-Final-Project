Teens are driving more during the summer and it might be more recreational than purposeful, the National Safety Council reports.
But one of the biggest reasons for the summer risk increase is that teens might be driving more frequently with more of their friends.
"It's tragic that parents don't really appreciate the risks of passengers," said Ulczycki, who said parents may understand the risks of texting or cell phone use, but aren't as aware of the dangers of a new driver hitting the road with friends in the car.
Ulczycki, a father of six in Wilmette, Illinois, didn't allow his children to drive with passengers for the first year of their official driving lives.
A recent study found that loud conversations and horseplay between passengers were more likely than technology to result in a dangerous incident involving teen drivers.
"Forty-three states currently restrict newly licensed drivers from having more than one young passenger in their vehicle," Robert Foss, senior research scientist at the Highway Safety Research Center, and director of the Center for the Study of Young Drivers, said in a news release.
Earlier this year, we traveled to Roxbury, New Jersey, to talk with Barb Dunn, her husband and her 16-year-old son Daniel about how they were trying to teach Daniel about safety as he learns to drive.

Ulczycki of the National Safety Council said the best advice for parents is to understand the risks about passengers and drive with them so they can get accustomed to having people in the car.
That's really the risk here, and I think too many parents think of night driving as a social curfew.
The best thing parents can do, she said on Facebook, is to teach teen drivers the best we can.
What do you think is the best way to keep teen drivers safe this summer?
