(CNN) -- Syria's embattled government will get at least 10 fighter jets from Russia -- and they want more, Russian state media reports -- moves that come amid rocky diplomatic efforts to peacefully end the Middle East nation's bloody civil war.
"As far as Russia is concerned, the contracts have nothing to do with the crisis," he told Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV, according to a transcript from Syria's official SANA news service.
Moscow, however, has said such deliveries would conform with international law and has denied supplying Syria with weapons that can be used against civilians.
"The best chance to save Syria (and) for a future Syria that represents all Syrian people and moves beyond this massacre, devastation, killing, sectarian violence ... is through a peaceful resolution that comes about in an organized way," he said Friday at a joint news conference in Washington with German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle.
"We have announced a couple of days ago that we agree in principle to attend," he said.
"So the idea of the conference, of a meeting, in principle is a good one," he told Al-Manar TV.
"It is difficult to continue when Syrians are constantly being hammered by the Assad regime with the help of outside forces," George Sabra, acting chairman of the National Coalition, said in a statement.
And as long as we are the legitimate representatives of the people, we have nothing to fear," the Syrian leader said.
There were 74 people killed in Aleppo province, including 50 prisoners who the group said were executed by government forces in Aleppo's Central Prison, the group said.
The report said they were ambushed in their car in the flashpoint province of Idlib in northwestern Syria, where government forces have been battling rebels for control.
Kerry, the top U.S. diplomat, said that some 1,500 to 2,000 American fighters may be in Syria.
"It's hard to get a peg on the exact number," he said.
