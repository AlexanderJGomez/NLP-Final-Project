Accordingly, we've compiled a list of some of the best dance scenes ever shown on-screen.
The beatnik black ensemble she wore for a scene in which she broke out into a Bohemian-style routine is still chic; the sequence was repurposed by Gap in a 2006 ad for "skinny black pants."
In 2002, Renée Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere starred in this Hollywood version of the popular musical.
Starring a mix of little-known young actors -- like future Avatar star Zoe Saldana--and professional ballet dancers, this 2000 film followed students at a fictional New York City dance school.
A much-delayed remake is scheduled to debut in 2011, but we're not sure it's possible to improve on the 1984 original -- we particularly like the scene in which small-town transplant Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon) dances his troubles away in an empty warehouse.
And who didn't love the final scene, in which Baby and Johnny (Patrick Swayze) "dirty" danced to (and even lip-synced along with) the then-contemporary song "I've Had the Time of My Life"?
