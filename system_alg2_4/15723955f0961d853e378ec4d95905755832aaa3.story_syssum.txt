Kevin Sheppard -- a six-foot point guard who competed internationally for 10 years after playing college ball -- was one of 13 Americans recruited by the Iranian Super League in the fall of 2008.
"Iran was beautiful," Sheppard said.
He stunned family and friends when he decided to play in Iran, where he averaged 26 points a game and eight assists as the team captain.
"I thought if it's nice then I'm going to see one of the best things a lot of people on this side of the world will never see."
"And my job was to teach them how to play the game the mental way.
Kevin!"
Schauder and his Iranian-American wife Sara Nodjoumi said they were fascinated by the notion of an American playing basketball "in a land allegedly full of nukes" and enjoying every minute of it.
"Sara and I looked at each other and said if he's as clever and funny as he is on Skype then I'll stay in Iran and we'll make this film," Schauder said.
For instance, Sheppard became close friends with three Iranian women, rare in a country where the sexes are forbidden from interacting in public.
"It was really bad for women.
"Kevin had the same perception about these places as many Americans; he just goes there and shatters them."
Schauder continued filming the discussions and cultural exchanges Sheppard encountered both on and off court, but as the 2009 presidential elections and violent street protests took hold, it became increasingly difficult to gather footage of him on the streets of Tehran.
"I mailed 80 tapes and kept the 10 I felt had the biggest nuggets with myself," Schauder says.
On the basketball court, Sheppard was unfazed by the street protests.
"I could see it on my teammates' faces," he said.
While still interested in visiting his friends back in Iran, he admits that might be difficult.
