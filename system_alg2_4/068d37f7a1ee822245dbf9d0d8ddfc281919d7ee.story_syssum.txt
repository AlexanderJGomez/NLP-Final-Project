Capable of soaring leaps and flawless turns, Tetsuya "Teddy" Kumakawa has thrilled audiences the world over.
Born in Sapporo on Hokkaido -- Japan's North Island -- in 1972, Kumakawa took up ballet after seeing his eight year-old cousin, Hironao perform at school in Sapporo.
Meister encouraged him to travel and recommended that he attend the Royal Ballet School (RBS) in London or the Canadian National Ballet School.
In June he won the Classical Ballet Prize at the Eurovision Young Dancer of the Year competition held in Paris.
The following season he was chosen for the role of the Fool in the premiere of Kenneth Macmillan's 'The Prince and the Pagodas'.
In 1998 he left the Royal Ballet to found his own company -- the K-Ballet -- back home in Tokyo.
Not only had he upped sticks in the middle of a season, he also took five of the Royal Ballet's star male performers with him to Japan.
The same year, the K-Ballet became the first Japanese ballet company to perform at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York.
