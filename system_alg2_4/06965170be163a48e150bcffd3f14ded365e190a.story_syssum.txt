Now the Supreme Court will decide whether the Kansas native can hold former Bush administration officials -- especially onetime Attorney General John Ashcroft -- personally liable for wrongful arrest and detention.
American Civil Liberties Union lawyers representing al-Kidd say the government has warped the law to allow open-ended arrests and confinement of citizens, without being later held accountable for those wrongfully held.
He was never told his testimony would be needed in any prosecution, nor was he forbidden to leave the country.
An affidavit submitted to a federal magistrate said al-Kidd had a one-way first class plane ticket, and that he was "crucial" to the prosecution of Sami Omar al-Hussayen.
He now teaches in Saudi Arabia and did not attend oral arguments at the high court.
He agreed to be deported to avoid a retrial.
A federal appeals court had allowed his civil lawsuit to continue, but Ashcroft argues officials under his supervision obeyed the letter and spirit of the material witness law.
"Prosecutors can out of spite, out of pure investigative reasoning, out of whatever motive they have, just lock people up," said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, while clarifying that may not be what happened in al-Kidd's case.
"We are talking about the attorney general and the attorney general's immunity," she told the Justice Department lawyer arguing the case.
Justice Elena Kagan is not participating in the case because she helped brief the case for the government last year as solicitor general, just before joining the high court.
Ashcroft has the support of the Obama administration, which argued the case in the high court, as well as several former attorneys general.
Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney, told CNN the government should not be allowed to do an "end run" around the law.
The case is Ashcroft v. al-Kidd (10-98).
A ruling is due by late June.
