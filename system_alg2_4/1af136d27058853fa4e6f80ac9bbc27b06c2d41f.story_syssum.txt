I identified it as a bomb, and I had to look twice," Clair said.

"We think they're great," one man said.

John Ryan said it's necessary to assume the worst until the team moves in.
"Everything is a bomb until we say it's not a bomb, " said Ryan.
"At the end of the day, it's just one day down and a lot more to go," said Det.
