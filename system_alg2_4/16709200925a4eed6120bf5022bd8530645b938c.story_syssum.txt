Woods shot a six-over-par 76 Saturday on Merion's unforgiving East Course and McIlroy, second only to Woods in the world rankings, carded a 75.
While the top-ranked duo were only four shots behind co-leaders Phil Mickelson and Billy Horschel through two rounds, McIlroy had slipped a further two shots behind the clubhouse leader, Australia's Jason Day, and Woods was seven shots behind Day.
McIlroy, in search of a third major, wasn't much better, hitting one more birdie than Woods.
Garcia said he was heckled in the first round and a fan blurted out, "fried chicken" before he teed off at his first hole Saturday.
Mickelson finished birdie-bogey, having dropped shots at 3 and 5 before recovering them at 10-11.
"But I feel better equipped than I have ever felt heading into the final round of a U.S. Open.
I love it."
Kim, born in South Korea but raised in San Diego, had been in a tie for third after firing four birdies in six holes but a horrendous finish -- bogey, double bogey, bogey -- meant he ended with a 71, five shots behind Mickelson.
