The Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, released its list Thursday as cardinals held meetings at the Vatican in a prelude to the selection of the next pontiff.
Tagle would normally be considered too young for the role, but Benedict XVI's almost unprecedented resignation might have changed the way the cardinals think, he said.
Asked what they think is the most important problem, 34% of the U.S. Catholics questioned mention sex abuse, pedophilia or some other reference to the scandal.
No date has been set for the conclave, or secret election, for the new pope, said the Rev.
Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman.
The discussions they are having in the general congregations are a vital part of the process, he said, since once the conclave starts there won't be much time between votes for reflection or the exchange of ideas.
Italian media reports Thursday focused on the Vatican's move to end the news briefings held this week by American cardinals, amid concerns over leaks of confidential discussions among the cardinals.
"We'll continue briefings, but without cardinals, to help U.S. media especially cover this exciting moment in the church," Walsh added.
Lombardi said 152 cardinals met Thursday morning.
Some of the discussions happen over coffee, as one Vatican spokesman revealed Monday, the first day of the general congregations.
"They want to say what the next pope will hear, because he's probably in that room, and they also want to alert the people who haven't spent so much time in Rome just what the situation really is here as they see it," Cardinal Francis George of Chicago said.
The electors also want to go into the conclave with pretty clear ideas about whom to vote for, Cardinal Sean O'Malley of Boston said.
In the 13th century, the election of one pope took two years and nine months, the diocese said.
