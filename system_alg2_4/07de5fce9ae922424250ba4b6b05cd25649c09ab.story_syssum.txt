Djokovic and former World No.1 Ana Ivanovic were beaten in the deciding mixed doubles 6-4 7-5 by Fernando Verdasco and Anna Medina Garrigues as Spain won the final 2-1 to claim the trophy at the mixed team event in Perth.
A statement by Djokovic's Family Sport company, the tournament organizers, was posted on the official ATP Tour website to confirm the decision, but without giving any reasons.
Djokovic has suffered mixed fortunes since arriving in Australia for the defense of the title at the opening grand slam of the season later this month.
Last year, the Serbian duo reached the final, but an abdominal injury to Ivanovic ended their chances.
