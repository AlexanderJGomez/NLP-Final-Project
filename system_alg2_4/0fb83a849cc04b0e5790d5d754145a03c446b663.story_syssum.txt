The case of Chandra Levy, a 24-year-old Washington intern whose body was found in a Washington park in 2002, is back in court, but the actions of a D.C. Superior Court judge have given it a mysterious air.
"We're very disappointed with the court leaving in place essentially blanket secrecy," Patrick Carome, an attorney representing the media outlets, told reporters outside the courthouse.
Carome predicted the secrecy surrounding hearings in the Levy case could last months.
Despite Fisher's restrictions on information, CNN has learned some key details of these unexpected hearings from Carome and court papers.
Armando Morales, a convicted felon and former gang member, testified at Guandique's trial that Guandique confessed to him in jail that he killed Levy.
Two women testified that Guandique attacked them in the same park.
Guandique repeatedly denied involvement in her murder, and prosecutors acknowledged a lack of DNA evidence linking Guandique to the crime and a lack of witnesses.
Condit testified at Guandique's trial and denied involvement in her disappearance and murder and was never charged.
