Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Sister Maria Gomez is an 87-year-old Catholic nun.
The elderly nun wearing a gray habit has become the face of what is known in Spain as Ninos Robados or Stolen Children.
We traveled to Spain to talk to those parents who believe their children were stolen and some who believe they were taken from their birth parents.
He said the money paid for the illegal adoption of both boys as newborn babies.
The truth angered both men so much that they tracked down the nun - not Sister Maria Gomez - who facilitated the illegal adoption and confronted her.
Barroso said: "I was so angry and I threatened her: you're going to have problems.
Like two kilos of tomatoes.
After that, Barroso set up Anadir, an association for Spain's stolen children.
Ines Perez and her daughter, Ines Madrigal, have a typically loving mother-daughter relationship but are also caught in the stolen babies scandal.
She remembers the day Ines Madrigal was born, precisely because she was not there.
When she arrived, she says, he placed a newborn baby in her arms and handed her a falsified birth certificate.
"The doctor said "Just put her in the car between two hot water bottles," Perez recalls.
He says a false birth certificate is a crime that can no longer be prosecuted because it happened so long ago and it does not prove a baby has been stolen.
In a summary of his testimony to investigators in the case of Ines Madrigal, Vela denies any wrong-doing, saying that he only helped women who wanted to put their children up for adoption, never pressuring any mother to do so.
Was she simply given up for adoption or was she one of Spain's stolen babies?
"I just want to know the truth."
