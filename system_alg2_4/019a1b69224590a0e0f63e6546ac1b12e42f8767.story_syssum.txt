E1 stands for East 1 and marks territory that the Israeli government has slated for settlement construction in the West Bank.
The construction in the E1 area would be an expansion of one of the largest Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Ma'ale Adumim, with about 40,000 inhabitants, and would merge it with the greater Jerusalem area.

The Palestinians want Israel to give up most settlements as part of any future two-state solution, but many believe that is not realistic considering the size of some of them.
The Palestinians say they will only return to the table if Israel freezes all settlement construction, while Benjamin Netanyahu's government wants negotiations without preconditions.
"If they build this settlement and close off our roads it will mean that my trip from Hebron to Jericho would take between five hours to a whole day."
It has to be built for our young couples," he told me from his office.
