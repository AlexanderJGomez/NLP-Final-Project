Washington (CNN) -- When Rosalind Cron left home in the 1940s to join a teenage girl jazz band called the International Sweethearts of Rhythm, she had no idea what it would be like, as a white girl, traveling with the predominantly black band.
She spent several hours in jail in El Paso, Texas, in 1944 when authorities didn't believe the story she had made up that her father was white and her mother was black.
By that time, according to Cron, the authorities that were holding her were glad to get rid of her.
The International Sweethearts of Rhythm were founded at Piney Woods School in Mississippi in 1937, in part as a way for the students to help pay for their education.
"The director of the music was named White," Wong said.
During World War II, the Sweethearts traveled to France and Germany as part of a USO tour in 1945.
"All I ever wanted to do was play a trumpet," Sadye Pankey told a group gathered at the museum.
Cron told the group that if music is your passion, you need to stick with it.
