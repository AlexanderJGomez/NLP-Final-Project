Then, like many of the friends you meet in those horrible, wonderful years, I never saw or talked to him again.
In our class, it was me and Brian.
That day, we became birthday friends.
Brian was an easy person to like.
One day in ninth-grade Spanish class, he rebelled against Miss Kahn's selected topic of conversation and instead suggested that we discuss the ongoing battle over Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court.
Brian and I were still in many of the same classes, but for whatever reason, he seemed less and less engaged in school.
Whatever the reason, the absences and missed assignments were taking a toll, and things came to a head in English class.
So we went over every mother-loving detail of that miserable Greek tragedy.
In the movie version, this is where I would say that he aced that exam and got his act together and excelled at everything he did thereafter, and it was all because of a little help from his friend who was born on the same day.
But I knew he had started college and focused on his loves of both philosophy and the environment.
By that time, I had graduated from college and was living out-of-state.
I think about whatever is going on in my life at the time, and how trivial it all suddenly seems.
By age 40, Brian Hull might have become a university professor or a successful entrepreneur or maybe an author.
We never played tennis, and we never saw each other over that summer.
It gives you a sense of your own mortality.
When I think about him today, I wonder who the other Brians in my life are right now -- am I squandering any opportunities to play tennis with them or see them over the summer?
