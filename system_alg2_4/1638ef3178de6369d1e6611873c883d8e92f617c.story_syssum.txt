What the #@!%?
On Monday, Microsoft confirmed it's trying to clean up language in its online community.
The statement did, however, quell a rumor that Microsoft was also monitoring direct communications such as Skype chats among players using the network.
Not surprisingly, the announcement isn't going over well with some in the gaming community.
And as I don't think that language deemed by some as 'foul' should be banned while playing games, I don't think that it should be banned in uploaded videos of games being played."
Microsoft said players who run afoul of its rules are being temporarily suspended from using certain apps, not banned from Xbox Live indefinitely.
