(CNN) -- Loyda Rodriguez says she can still remember the day her daughter was taken.
In 2008, she told ABC News a woman appeared in her backyard and grabbed her out of her arms, while she was trying to enter her house.
She said she's given multiple interviews on the case, and stood by what she said earlier -- that she left the girl outside after returning from a shopping trip.
It all happened in about two minutes, Rodriguez said.
Guatemalan authorities say Anyeli was snatched from Rodriguez and sold to an international adoption agency.
Rodriguez told CNN she was devastated by the news.

However, a source with knowledge of the case told CNN that while Rodriguez's DNA matches the DNA of a child brought to the embassy in Guatemala, there is no evidence the child in question in the United States is the same child tested at the embassy.
Rodriguez says she now hopes to go to court in Missouri to get her daughter back.
Last year a family representative said the adoptive parents would "continue to advocate for the safety and best interests of their legally adopted child.
