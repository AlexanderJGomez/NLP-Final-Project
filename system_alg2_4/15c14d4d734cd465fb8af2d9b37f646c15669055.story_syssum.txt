Spencer Elden, 17, recreates his pose from 1991's Nirvana "Nevermind" album.
"Stuff happens like random cool situations where I get paid $500 just to go hang out," Elden said.
Like Nirvana, Elden hopes to entertain us.
Fairey heard Elden interviewed on the radio and one thing led to another, said the teen.
A Hollywood film role might be in the works, but Elden and his father, who is also a designer and artist, aren't revealing any details.
Really, all he wants is a guest spot on the "Howard Stern Show."

The triumph blew 1980s-style "poodle-hair metal" music off the map, wrote Rolling Stone magazine, which in 2003 ranked "Nevermind" at No.
"Nevermind" essentially sowed the seeds for music that defined the 1990s, said Tom Moon, author of  "1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die."
Nirvana's promise was cut short in 1994 by Cobain's suicide at age 27 in his Seattle, Washington, home.
"It was no accident that Alice in Chains, Screaming Trees and bands like that connected in the wake of what Nirvana did," said Moon.
