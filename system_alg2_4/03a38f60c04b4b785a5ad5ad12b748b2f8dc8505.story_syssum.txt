New York (CNN) -- Police are investigating the slaying of a 32-year-old man in the Greenwich Village neighborhood early Saturday as a hate crime because the gunman made multiple anti-gay comments, they said.
They didn't know it, Kelly said, but the suspect followed them.
The gunman confronted the two men again, before shooting Carson in the face, police said.
The identities of the suspect's two companions -- at least one of whom Kelly said left the suspect before the shooting -- are still not known.
Kelly said that the killing appeared to be "a hate crime, a bias crime."
On May 8, another gay man was assaulted by two men shouting anti-gay slurs as he left a bar in Manhattan's West Village, New York Police said.
There was another attack on gay men on May 5, outside of Madison Square Garden following a New York Knicks game.
