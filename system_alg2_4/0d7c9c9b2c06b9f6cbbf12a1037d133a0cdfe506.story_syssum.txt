Instead all Americans -- no matter what income level they have and no matter what neighborhood they live in -- are getting bigger because food is cheaper than ever before, the study authors say.
The study, published in the June edition of the journal CA Cancer, found that people in 1930 spent about a fourth of their disposable income on food.
And Americans have more access to fruits and vegetables," said Roland Sturm who is a senior economist at the RAND Corporation.
While the data isn't perfect, experts looking at health records for men between the ages of 40 and 49 see a steady increase in body mass index since 1900.
"What this article reinforces is that we need to continue our research to find what combination of strategies will be most effective long term in helping all of us live healthier lives," said Colleen Doyle, director of nutrition and physical activity for the American Cancer Society.
"No one thing is the solution to this problem we are having," Doyle said.
Agriculture policy "has a huge impact on what people eat," said study co-author An Ruopeng.
"We don't want food to become really expensive again; that is not the answer," said Sturm.
A tax on sugary foods and sodas in Mexico was also introduced last year, but experts are still waiting to see what impact that policy will have on eating habits.
It will take more than public policy to end the obesity epidemic, the study authors say.
"When people come over to visit, you offer them a coke or freshly baked cookies," Sturm said.
