Before I became a father, I struggled to find advice that really spoke to me, and I hope that the following bits of wisdom speak to other American dads, men who really want to be the best they can be.
My son, still inside her, was slipping away from us.
But like countless others, we had to make a difficult call that day.
After they clipped the cord and I said the call to prayer in his ear, we brought him around the curtain to his mother.
Thankfully, my son heard our voices, the same voices he had been hearing since he was able to hear while inside the womb.
Are they sure they know what they are doing?"
We are tied together by faith and an overriding sense that we need to raise our son in a way that is different from how we were both raised.
But how do we do this?
First, my faith tells me that my son is without sin.
Constantly strengthening our own sense of faith as he watches is step three.
Second, my son is good.
I have to nurture and bring out the best in him.
Third, my son was born intelligent, as a whole human being, with the ability to express and understand human emotion.
Fifth, I have to be the best human being I can be.
Right now, my son is sleeping.
At the core, he is a good human being whose soul comes from the Creator of the Universe, and my wife and I have been chosen as the primary caretakers for this vessel of light, this small human being.
And we will do the best we know how, praying all along that it is enough.
