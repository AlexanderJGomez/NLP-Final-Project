(CNN) -- Making it to the top in one of the toughest and most fickle industries in the world, that of fashion design, requires a careful balance of knowing your own essence and giving the public what they expect.
Maurer, who has just shown her debut spring/summer 2013 collection for Paco Rabanne at Paris Fashion Week, was born in Germany to a German father and a Colombian mother and at the age of three moved to Mexico.
The biggest reward, she says, is creating a collection that persists after the fashion show and seeing that people really want to wear the clothes and the garments do not live on the rack.
On her childhood interest in fashion ...
I think that it's that sensibility to color also, to materials mostly that people always saw in me.
On studying at Studio BerÃ§ot ...
I have to represent a company, a fashion house that is historic ... that's always attached to the '60s, and now the biggest challenge is to bring it forward to our times.
It's also important to balance for me in this collection, the wearable side with the extraordinary piece side.
Anything can be interesting.
In the end, what you're doing is not just supposed to be living for one fashion show, and then you pack it and put it in the archives.
