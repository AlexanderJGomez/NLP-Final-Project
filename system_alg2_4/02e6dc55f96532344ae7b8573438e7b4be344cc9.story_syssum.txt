(CNN)In Moscow on February 27, 2015, a lone gunman killed Boris Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister and a powerful and charismatic opposition leader who stood as an alternative to Vladimir Putin.
Of course, Kirov wasn't the first political opponent to fall, any more than Nemtsov was.
But this was the first top-level political assassination of a person who could have become party leader.
In the death of Nemtsov, irrespective of who is ultimately found responsible, we once again have the assassination of a person who could have become the leader of the country.
The Putin regime has succeeded over the last 15 years in establishing a regime that historically is unparalleled in its thievery.
The perfidy of the regime is quite unparalleled since Hitler hid his expansionism behind the desire to reunite German-speakers in the Sudetenland.
They can (for now) still connect with each other on social media.
Nemtsov had thousands of followers on social media, and many of his friends also have thousands of followers.
One can only hope it will attract large numbers.
Let's hope that this time they will see Nemtsov's death as the "shot that was heard around the world" and mobilize to deter further Russian oppression and expansionism.
But standing with them in their insistence -- echoing Nemtsov -- that Putin's authoritarian regime is based on massive corruption, will be more important than ever.
