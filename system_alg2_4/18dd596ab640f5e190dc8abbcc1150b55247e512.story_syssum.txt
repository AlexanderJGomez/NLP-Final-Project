In the space of one devastating week, natural disasters killed more people in Afghanistan than they did all last year.
At the heart of the destruction was the double landslide that engulfed a village in a remote northeastern province on Friday, killing more than 2,000 people.
Over the weekend, authorities gave up hope of finding anybody alive.
But IOM staff on the ground said the double landslide killed as many as 2,700 people and affected 14,000 others.
Sunday was declared a national day of mourning for victims of the disaster.
The landslide followed days of flash floods across nine northern Afghan provinces that killed more than 160 people, displaced 16,000 others and affected a further 50,000, according to a bulletin from the International Federation of the Red Cross.
"There have now been more Afghans killed through natural disasters in the past seven days than all of 2013," said Mark Bowden, U.N. Humanitarian coordinator in Afghanistan.
