Following a lengthy trial, he and his former interior minister, Habib al-Adly, were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison last year on charges that they were complicit in the protesters' killings.
Six of Mubarak's former security aides last year were acquitted of charges related to the killings, and Mubarak's two sons -- Gamal and Alaa -- were acquitted of corruption charges.
He made his first court appearance in May.
He also faces a corruption charge that was not part of the original trial.
