In November of last year, 19-year-old Aqsa Mahmood gave her father, Muzaffar, a long hug goodbye.
Four days later, Aqsa called her parents back in Scotland, just as she was crossing into Syria from its border with Turkey.
Her father says when he spoke to her about coming home, she said that she would see her family on Judgment Day and would like to be a martyr.
"There was nothing they (Aqsa's parents) could have done different.
Aqsa is said to be influenced by watching sermons online and coming in contact with people through social media that helped her make the trek from Glasgow to Syria.
They went to the prestigious private school Craigholme down the road.
We just don't know what happened to her.
On her desk, colorful loom bands and bracelets hung from a goosenecked lamp, a dog-eared copy of "The Hunger Games" nearby.
"She didn't go out much.
We all went together," Muzaffar says.
I can't believe this," Khalida tearfully says, explaining the shock the family feels about her daughter's decision.
But she made one mistake, but otherwise, she is really a very good girl.
Her mother says Aqsa never complained despite being asked to help with housework.
Now we have to find a mahram (male guardian).
Obviously, no Muslim approves this."
In one of the exchanges Muzaffar had with his daughter, she told him that she is praying every day to become "shahid," or a martyr.
The family hopes and prays that Aqsa will come home.
In a special message to Aqsa through CNN, her parents made a personal appeal to their daughter.
Looking directly into the camera, Khalida said, "Aqsa, my dear daughter, please come back.
Your sisters and brother miss you a lot.
I love you, my dear daughter.
Islam is peace.
Anwar, the lawyer, says Aqsa is not directly responsible for committing any crimes and is safe to return home.
