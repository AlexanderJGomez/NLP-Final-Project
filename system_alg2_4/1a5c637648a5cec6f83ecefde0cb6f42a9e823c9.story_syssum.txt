NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN)  -- Fans of porn star Stormy Daniels are drafting her to run for the U.S. Senate seat in Louisiana now held by Republican Sen. David Vitter.
Will the Draft Stormy move mean stormy weather for Vitter?
The Draft Stormy campaign was started by New Orleans resident and Daniels fan Zack Hudson, who insists it's for real.
"I think anyone that knows me ... is more than aware of that," Daniels said.
Stormy's decision to sign with Wicked highlighted her commitment to sending a positive message to young people of the importance of practicing safe sex," the bio said.
While her political aspirations may be a light diversion for Louisiana voters, reality will set in if Daniels tangles with Vitter.
If the Daniels campaign is meant to remind voters of Vitter's D.C. Madam link, the move could backfire, DuBos said.
