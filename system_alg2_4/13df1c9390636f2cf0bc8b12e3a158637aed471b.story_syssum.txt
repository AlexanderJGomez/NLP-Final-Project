Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro told a CNN reporting team Friday that it could continue reporting in the South American country, a day after the government revoked or denied press credentials for CNN journalists.
There they are.
No other Latin American news but Venezuela," Maduro said.
Maduro called on CNN to rectify its reporting.
Do it.
He who does not respect the laws will not be on Venezuelan airwaves."
"We expect that you will be able to go with the loss recovered," Maduro said.
I do not accept war propaganda against Venezuela.
Out!"
CNN teams from outside Venezuela were told to book flights back to their home countries.
While the journalists were asked to leave, CNN International and CNN en Espa√±ol continue to broadcast in Venezuela.
"CNN has reported both sides of the tense situation in Venezuela, even with very limited access to government officials," CNN said in a statement, adding that at the time its credentials were revoked, CNN was seeking an interview with the president.
Venezuela also expelled three U.S. diplomats this week, accusing them of conspiring to bring down the government -- an accusation that the State Department has repeatedly denied.
