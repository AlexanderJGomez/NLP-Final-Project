Rather than having dinner with her husband, Walter E. "Eugene" Crum, she spent Thursday night mourning his violent death and taking over the job he held as sheriff of Mingo County, West Virginia.
Rosie Crum did not speak at the ceremony, though she did hug 22 deputies who came to the ceremony, county commissioner John Mark Hubbard said.
It took two shots to kill Eugene Crum around noon Wednesday, as he sat in a parking lot near the Mingo County courthouse.
The suspect -- Tennis Melvin Maynard, 37 -- was in critical but stable condition Thursday at Cabell Huntington Hospital, said Rockel.
He "said some things to us" on his way to the hospital, West Virginia State Police First Sgt.
"We are unsure at this point," Rockel said, why the sheriff was killed.
On Thursday, a source with knowledge of the suspect's past told CNN that Maynard had spent time at a state hospital for mental health issues within the past couple of years.
"He talks a lot to himself," Olgie Maynard said.
"...
"Those charges are pending on him getting out of the hospital," Rockel said.
His slaying has shaken the rural county, which normally sees only one or two slayings per year, said Lt. Randy Hatfield of the Mingo County Sheriff's Office.
In addition to Thursday night's candlelight vigil, a memorial service for Crum will be held late Saturday afternoon and his funeral will take place Sunday, both services at Mingo Central High School.
"It's quite obvious that the last 26 hours have been a difficult time," said Hubbard, president of the Mingo County commission.
