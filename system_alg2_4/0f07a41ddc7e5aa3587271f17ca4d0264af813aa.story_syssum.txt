"I stand by the decision because of the law," she said.
At the beginning of deliberations, Maddy told ABC, she wanted to convict Zimmerman of second-degree murder.
O'Mara said that the defense acknowledged Zimmerman killed Martin -- in self-defense.
"Based on her comments, Juror B29 accepted a tremendous burden, set her feelings aside, and cast a verdict based the evidence presented in court and on the law she was provided."
Maddy is the second juror to speak about the high-profile case since the all-female jury acquitted Zimmerman earlier this month.
Zimmerman has been out of the public eye since the jury found him not guilty of second-degree murder on July 13.
