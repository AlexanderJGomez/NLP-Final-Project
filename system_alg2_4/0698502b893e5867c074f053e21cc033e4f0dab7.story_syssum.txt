Mizoram, India (CNN) -- The world's population hits 7 billion this week, but Ziona, the patriarch of what may be the biggest family in the world, is not bothered.
Ziona's father, Chana, founded the Christian sect in Baktwang village that promotes polygamy as God's will.
Four hours away from Mizoram's only airport, in the isolated village of Baktwang, Ziona's bright purple house with 22 bedrooms stands out.
"There is no discrimination amongst us, he treats us all equally," fifth wife Twangi says.
Ziona first got married when he was 17 to Zathiangi, who is now 70.
Like a well-oiled machine, everyone carries out their individual chore, so dinner for 160 is ready within an hour and utensils are washed and put away within minutes.
"No fighting, never, we are all one family, there's no other people here so we don't fight," says sixth grandson Hmingthamzauva, one of the few in the household who speaks English.
But while he likes living in a big family, he himself doesn't want more than one wife.
Ziona is the caretaker of the self-reliant sect.
"My father is the greatest god that we can have in this world, he has done so much for us," says his eldest son Nunparliana, who has two wives and 14 children.
"I'm not troubled by the noise or the overcrowding.
The family is not listed in the Guinness Book of World Records because Ziona says he doesn't want the publicity.
