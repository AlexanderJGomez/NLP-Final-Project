Do you own a wrap dress?
This item is Diane Von Furstenberg's wrap dress.
Diane Von Furstenberg, or DVF as she's known, sold her first wrap dress in the 1970s.
"It's a very traditional form of clothing, it's a dress that has no buttons and no zipper," said Von Furstenberg.
There was a time when the trend for wrap dresses was declared over, but like any good (or bad) fashion, it experienced a revival.
"My love affair with the DVF wrap dress began in the 1970s," says Anna Boccia Lewis, a self-confessed "DVF addict" from California.
CNN asked other women to tell us what it is about DVF dresses that make them so special.
Kirsty Palmer, also from the United Kingdom, recently sold one of her DVF dresses on eBay.
