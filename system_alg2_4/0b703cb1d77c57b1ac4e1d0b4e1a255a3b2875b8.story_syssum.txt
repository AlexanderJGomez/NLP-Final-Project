Military action in Syria, he said this weekend as he sought congressional approval, will be limited.
Once the United States becomes directly involved in Syria, there can be no turning back.
On the ground, competing interests have fractured the country.
By intervening now to inflict limited punishment on al-Assad because chemical weapons have been used, the United States is erecting a precedent that could be exploited in the future by the more unscrupulous factions of the opposition looking to provoke further interventions.
If limited use of chemical weapons can succeed in drawing the United States into the conflict in a way that 100,000 deaths by conventional arms could not, they could be viewed by al-Assad's adversaries -- particularly by the foreign fighters affiliated with al Qaeda -- as a blessing rather than a scourge.
So what will the United States do the next time chemical weapons are used in Syria?
Can it refuse to live up to its own precedent if 10,000 Syrians were killed in a fresh massacre after Obama's "limited" intervention has concluded?
Their ambition is not simply to defeat al-Assad.
But in Syria, there's every chance that it will escalate the conflict.
Ultimately tantalizing the losing side in the Syrian civil war with a brief, punitive, "limited" entry on its behalf will only hasten the creation of conditions that will eventually suck America back into the conflict.
