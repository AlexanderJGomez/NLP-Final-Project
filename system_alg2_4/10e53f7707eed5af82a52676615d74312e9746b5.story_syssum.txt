(CNN) -- Congolese rebels took control of the eastern city of Goma and part of the border with Rwanda on Tuesday after days of heavy clashes, a Congolese reporter there said.
The United Nations, the African Union and countries in the region are demanding that M23 immediately stop its attacks, Buey said.
An M23 rebel spokesman, calling his group the Revolutionary Army of Congo, went on the radio Tuesday afternoon to address the people of Goma.
The group has already started recruiting new members at the police headquarters in Goma, according to the Congolese reporter on the scene.
Nor could MONUSCO, which is mandated to protect civilians in Goma.
Security analysts say the rebellion in eastern Congo has dangerous regional implications, and the international community has expressed alarm at the M23 advances.
The International Crisis Group, an independent anti-conflict non-profit group, warned that the fall of Goma could lead to serious human rights abuses against civilians.
Rwanda will not engage in any talks with M23, Mushikiwabo said.
Mushikiwabo said Rwanda would close the border crossing if asked to by the Congolese government, but that such a move could have humanitarian consequences.
