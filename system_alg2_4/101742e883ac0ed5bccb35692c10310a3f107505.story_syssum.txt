This summer, big doings on America's northern doorstep will have enormous consequences to the economic, strategic and environmental future of the nation.
It could draw our leaders into a conflict over undersea territory.
-- Shell is poised to sink exploratory wells -- temporary ones drilled from ships -- 70 miles north of Alaska in a few weeks.
They say the oil could be extracted safely.
-- In Washington, politicians are jockeying over whether to ratify "The Law of the Sea Treaty," under which countries abutting oceans will be able to claim up to 200 extra miles of undersea territory if they can prove it an extension of their continental shelves.
One U.S. Coast Guard admiral, speaking of the treaty, told me, "If this was a ball game, the U.S. wouldn't be on the field, in the stadium or even in the parking lot.
-- The Russian military has identified the Arctic as one of the likely places for conflict to erupt in the 21st century over resources.
Russia is opening their Arctic sea lanes to commercial shipping.
-- The Northwest Passage is the long-dreamed-of, formerly iced-over sea route between Europe and Asia.
For the past three years, I've spent much time in northern Alaska researching for my book, "The Eskimo and the Oil Man."
That 4,000-year-old culture sits at the border between wise development and environmental anarchy, and the people of America's polar county will soon watch with hope and fear as the oil ships move north.
Look to the Arctic.
