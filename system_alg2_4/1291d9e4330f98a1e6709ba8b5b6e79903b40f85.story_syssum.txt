The manhunt for Eric Matthew Frein, accused of killing a Pennsylvania state trooper, is over.
"We just thought it was fitting," State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said.
Bryon Dickson and wounding Trooper Alex T. Douglass before melting into the thick Pennsylvania woods.
The squad of 13 U.S. marshals -- armed like a military special operations squad -- found Frein at an abandoned airport near Tannersville, authorities said.
There was no struggle, Pike County District Attorney Raymond Tonkin said.
Frein was in good physical condition when he was captured, apart from a cut on his nose that he had before the marshals found him, according to Noonan.
And also, he had been preparing himself by participating in these re-enactments, especially in the Vietnam era, where he specifically trained himself and trained with other people to hide in the woods and avoid detection."
His voice was strong as he answered, "Yes I do," to a Pike County judge's question if he understood the charges against him, which include first-degree murder and criminal homicide of a law enforcement officer.
Tom Corbett said he expects authorities to make sure Frein stays safe.
Tonkin declined to say what, if anything, Frein has revealed about the attack that left Dickson dead and Douglass critically wounded.
Authorities have not discussed a motive but have said Frein has talked and written about hating law enforcement.
"Eric Frein had a mission that was to attack law enforcement," Noonan said.
There was no indication that anyone was helping Frein, who was "quite well-prepared," Noonan said.
But with Frein in custody, the trick-or-treating will go on as normal, said Barrett Township Board Chairman Ralph Megliola.
"I'm ecstatic -- and just in time for Halloween!"
We are so proud of our Pennsylvania State Police, their hard work," another said.
"Now it's a celebration," one woman wearing a "Barrett Proud" shirt told WNEP.
