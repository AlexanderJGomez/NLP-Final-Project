Wayne Nelson Corliss was arrested at his New Jersey apartment.
It was among items found in his apartment, along with five hard drives containing more than 1,000 images of child pornography, according to prosecutors.
Interpol announced Tuesday that it was attempting to identify the man, who was featured in 100 photographs sexually abusing at least three boys between the ages of 6 and 10, it said.
Corliss is charged with producing child pornography, according to prosecutors.
The images found in 2006 were on a computer and stored in a file named "Thai--Luv," according to the criminal complaint filed against Corliss, which was released by the Department of Justice.
The complaint alleges that the suspect's face is clearly shown and the background suggests the images were taken in Thailand.
A search of U.S. passport information found an image of Corliss that police compared to the photographs, the complaint said.
In October, it disseminated pictures of another man whose face -- altered to disguise his identity -- appeared in more than 200 images of sex acts with children, thought to have been taken in Vietnam and Cambodia.
