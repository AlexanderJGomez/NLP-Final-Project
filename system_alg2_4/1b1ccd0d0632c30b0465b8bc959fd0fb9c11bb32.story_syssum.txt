The co-founder of Twitter and chief executive officer of Square met with CNN's Maggie Lake to share his vision on how mobile payments will change the world of commerce.
"What I think is great about technology, and every technology that exists, [is that] it increases the number of people who can participate, in our case commerce," Dorsey said.
Square is competing in a jammed arena -- mobile payments already exist via Paypal and others -- but Dorsey told CNN its pitch is different.
Square aims to have "one, end-to-end, great, frictionless experience -- and that's been our focus from day one," Dorsey said.
Both ideas are "fundamental to humanity....both are extremely complex and both companies are trying to make each simple."
