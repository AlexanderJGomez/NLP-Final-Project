In defiance of the country's moderate climate, the architects say they have devised a system to control the park's outdoor environment, using old and new farming technologies to simulate Mediterranean and tropical climates in an ecologically sustainable way.
Because this will also be a recreational space, our goal is to make it as open as possible, without using greenhouses," he said.
According to van Bergen, "snake walls", made from clay, curve over crops helping to shield them from cold winds, while simultaneously emitting heat absorbed during the day.
However, for tropical foods like mangoes and basmati rice, van Bergen says the park will need another layer of warmth.
If successful, the firm believes this type of system could form part of a new approach to sustainable farming, making use of urban greenbelts while helping to reduce the carbon footprint associated with food production -- which accounts for up to 30% of total emissions worldwide, according to a 2008 Greenpeace report.
"Because all the food in our supermarket will be grown on site we won't need a big processing factory to make packaging and we won't have to burn lots of fossil fuel to transport it across the globe," he said.
"However, I have reservations about any system that creates open artificial climates.
I think creating tropical climates next to moderate ones could introduce a host of new diseases and pests to the region in quite an unpredictable way," she warned.
For van Bergen, this type of criticism misses the point, because he sees the Park Supermarket as just one of many possible alternatives to the existing system of food production.
"Just like our energy, I think our future food supplies will have to come from a variety of sources, using a variety of methods -- of which we are sure this will be one.
