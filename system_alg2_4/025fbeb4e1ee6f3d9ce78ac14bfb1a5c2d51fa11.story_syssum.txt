The armed forces also are accused of funneling money from diamond fields to President Robert Mugabe's party.
"Three men in army uniform jumped into my car and asked me to drive them back to the mining area," Chiso said.
Kimberly Process officials urged the government to demilitarize the diamond fields and investigate the accusations against the military.
Separately, Human Rights Watch has accused the armed forces of funneling money from the fields into ZANU-PF, President Robert Mugabe's party.
The government has not been able to verify allegations of deaths and mass graves, Mohadi said.
"The money will not be handled by any party but by the Treasury," he said.
