WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Former President Carter warned members of Congress on Tuesday that America's failure to achieve energy independence is threatening the country's national security, undermining its long-term potential for economic growth and contributing to global warming.

Congressional attention to the issue is being driven by President Obama, who, like Carter, has placed energy near the top of his domestic agenda.
But after "a long period of energy complacency," he said, daily imports to the United States are now almost 13 million barrels.
The former president reminded committee members that, as part of his drive for renewable energy, he had ordered 32 solar panels to be placed on the roof of the White House in 1979.
Richard Nixon was the first president to set a goal of energy independence, Kerry noted.
Nixon called for that goal to be reached by 1980.
