Under this plan, the Treasury would have bought the "troubled assets" of financial institutions in an attempt to avoid economic meltdown.
Here's why.
The government implicitly promised these institutions that it would make good on their debts, so Fannie and Freddie took on huge amounts of excessive risk.
The fact that government bears such a huge responsibility for the current mess means any response should eliminate the conditions that created this situation in the first place, not attempt to fix bad government with more government.
In contrast, a bailout transfers enormous wealth from taxpayers to those who knowingly engaged in risky subprime lending.
Thus, the bailout encourages companies to take large, imprudent risks and count on getting bailed out by government.
If financial institutions cannot make productive loans, a profit opportunity exists for someone else.
Further, the current credit freeze is likely due to Wall Street's hope of a bailout; bankers will not sell their lousy assets for 20 cents on the dollar if the government might pay 30, 50, or 80 cents.
Anticipation of the bailout will engender strategic behavior by Wall Street institutions as they shuffle their assets and position their balance sheets to maximize their take.
The bailout will open the door to further federal meddling in financial markets.
The right view of the financial mess is that an enormous fraction of subprime lending should never have occurred in the first place.
