John Blake, who helped write the CNN.com special report "Black in America," is author of the 2004 book "Children of the Movement," which profiles the children of the civil rights movement's leading figures and of segregationists.

"When I was growing up and I wanted to talk to my father to get advice, and no one was there, it hit then," he said.

Shabazz knew that her father was a civil rights activist, but her family never talked in detail about that side of him.

The daughter of George Wallace -- the Alabama governor who once boasted that segregation would last forever -- said her father had to be a segregationist to get elected.
He would never mistreat one of them."
They were going to try to change the world, even if it meant dying for their cause -- and many did, she said.
