The order is part of a broader strategy intended to strengthen the administration's ability to prevent atrocities, including creation of an Atrocities Prevention Board, Obama said in somber remarks at the U.S.
Obama said the new Atrocities Prevention Board will meet for the first time on Monday at the White House.
"Our Treasury Department will work more quickly to deploy its financial tools to block the flow of money to abusive regimes," the president said.
We cannot and should not."
In particular, Wiesel said threats by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to use nuclear weapons to destroy Israel must be confronted.
"How is it that the Holocaust number one denier -- Ahmadinejad -- is still a president," Wiesel said in introducing Obama.
The president has come under criticism from Republicans and some pro-Israel groups for not taking stronger steps to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.
In his remarks Monday, Obama also announced that he will award the nation's highest civilian honor -- the Presidential Medal of Freedom -- to the late Jan Karski, a resistance figure who tried to alert the world to the Holocaust atrocities during World War II.
