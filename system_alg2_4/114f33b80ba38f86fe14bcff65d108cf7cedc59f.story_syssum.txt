(CNN) -- A Spanish nurse's assistant who left the hospital Wednesday after beating Ebola said she was still weak but gave thanks to God and the health workers who cared for her that she was still alive.
"I don't know what went wrong.
I am one of them."
"When I saw myself dying, I had memories of my family, of my husband," she said.
As a childless couple, the dog "was the son we never had," Limon said.
Romero is now clear of the virus but still recovering her strength, Dr. Jose Ramon Arribas told a news conference earlier Wednesday, flanked by other hospital personnel.
Romero was the first person to be infected with Ebola outside West Africa in the current outbreak.
