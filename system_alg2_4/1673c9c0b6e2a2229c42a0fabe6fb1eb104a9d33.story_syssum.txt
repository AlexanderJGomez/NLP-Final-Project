(CNN) -- New research suggests that crabs not only suffer pain but that they retain a memory of it.
Professor Elwood, whose previous work showed that prawns endure pain, said his research highlighted the need to investigate the treatment of crustaceans used in food industries.
Hermit crabs are known to prefer some species of shells to others and it was found that that they were more likely to come out of the shells they least preferred.
"This research demonstrates that it is not a simple reflex but that crabs trade-off their need for a quality shell with the need to avoid the harmful stimulus.
The results are consistent with the idea of pain being experienced by these animals."
But Professor Elwood says that in contrast to mammals, little protection is given to the millions of crustaceans that are used in the fishing and food industries each day.
"There is no protection for these animals (with the possible exception of certain states in Australia) as the presumption is that they cannot experience pain.
