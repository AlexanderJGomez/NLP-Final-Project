Red Bull's four-time world champion has signed a three-year contract with the Scuderia, the oldest team in F1, from 2015.
There are still seats to be filled at McLaren, Force India and Toro Rosso.
The Spaniard -- a double world champion with Renault in 2005 and 2006 -- is regarded as the key to the F1 driver market.
Alonso is expected to lead this new era at McLaren, although the fiercely ambitious driver may first want guarantees that the Honda engine is going to be a success.
"The next stage of my Formula One career will be spent with Ferrari and for me that means the dream of a lifetime has come true," Vettel said.
Vettel will partner Kimi Raikkonen -- the last man to win a world title with Ferrari in 2007 -- in 2015 but there are no guarantees the car and its Ferrari engine will be any match for the might of Mercedes.
Alonso remains the red-hot favorite to take one of the seats but the future of current drivers Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen remains unclear.
Button -- the 2009 world champion with Brawn Grand Prix which has since morphed into Mercedes -- has remained sanguine about his future and has even explored the idea of moving to sports car racing.
There are still seats on offer at McLaren, Force India and Toro Rosso.
Sauber announced Swede Marcus Ericsson and Brazilian Felipe Nasr as its 2015 drivers in November much to the chagrin of current driver Adrian Sutil, who believed he had a contract with the team for next season.
Japan's Kamui Kobayashi retained his drive while the team has also handed Briton and former tester Will Stevens his F1 debut.
