Mistry is not new to the group; he has been on the board of Tata Sons since 2006 and will now serve as the group's deputy chairman until Ratan Tata retires in December 2012.
His family owns 18% stake in Tata Sons, making the family the second biggest share-holder behind Tata Trust which has a 67% stake.
With more than 100 companies in various sectors from steel to automobiles to tea, spread across 80 countries, Tata Sons employs almost half a million people around the world.
In a recent interview with CNN, Tata had said he would like to leave behind a group of companies that continues his family's legacy.
