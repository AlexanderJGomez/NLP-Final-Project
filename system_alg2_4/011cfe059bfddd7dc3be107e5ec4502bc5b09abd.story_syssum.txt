Like the bespectacled character from 90s sitcom, "Family Matters," Woods freely admits to having a "nerdy side" but his attraction to Olympic skiing champion Vonn, who also described him as "funny" and "a great guy" in a recent interview, has far more to do with mutual passions.
I think that's why we get along so well," Woods said.
Looking at some of the guys on tour, they've got huge guts and can't breathe when they go up to tee boxes but they can still win golf tournaments," Woods said.
"I knew I could get back, but I had to get healthy first.
I couldn't practice unless I got healthy.
It's a frustration, admits Woods, after being in contention at two majors this year.
I've been there with chances to win at the weekend, I just haven't done it yet," he said.
"A lot of golfers peak in their 30s.
"For Jack (Nicklaus) it took him until he was 46 ... You are going to have your years when you play really well -- you may clip two or three -- and then you have years when you just don't win anything -- you are there, you just don't happen to win," he said.
Last month, golf journalist Brandel Chamblee awarded Woods a grade "F" for his 2013 labors, noting provocatively that he had been "a little cavalier with the rules" -- a reference to four rules violations this year including the controversial two-shot penalty at Augusta.
Woods takes refuge in practice, "hanging out with my boys" at the Medalist Golf Club near his home in Florida and focusing on his children: six-year-old daughter Sam and son Charlie who turned four this year.
It's the first time he's seen me win a golf tournament.
It was a little bit shocking to him and he also loved it at the same time."
Other than that, I just watch and to me that's just a thrill."
