Christopher Coleman sits in the back of a police car after his arrest Tuesday in the slayings of his wife and two sons.
Coleman was arrested Tuesday at his parents' home in Chester, Illinois.
Coleman told police he left the house at 5:43 a.m. the day of the deaths and drove to a gym to work out.
In an article posted on the Major Case Squad's Web site, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper reported the message said something to the effect of, "I told you this would happen."
Coleman previously worked in the security department for Joyce Meyer Ministries, an evangelical Christian organization based in suburban St. Louis, said spokesman Roby Walker.
Joyce Meyer Ministries said in a statement Wednesday that it had learned of the charges against Coleman.
