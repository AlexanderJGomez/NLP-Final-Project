A desalination plant.
Thanks to improved technology, turning ocean water into freshwater is becoming more economically feasible.
This is why a huge desalination plant is under construction in Carlsbad, California, some 30 miles north of San Diego.
Most desalination technology follows one of two methods: distillation through thermal energy or the use of membranes to filter salt from water.
Officials at the Carlsbad plant say they can covert two gallons of seawater into one gallon of freshwater by filtering out 99.9% of the salt.
Israel, in an arid region with a coastline on the Mediterranean, meets half its freshwater needs through desalination.
In the United States, desalination projects are concentrated in coastal states such as California, Florida and Texas.
Within the United States, the water crisis is especially severe in California, which has been stricken by drought over the last three years.
Seventeen desalination plants are being built or planned along the state's 840-mile coastline.
"The cost for this water will be about double what it costs us to import water into San Diego," Yamada said.
"However, over time we expect that the cost of desalinated water will equal, and be less than, the cost of imported water.
"When and if the drought does come, and you don't have enough snowpack in the Sierras -- after 12 dry years the Rockies are seeing the impact of that today -- you've got (water) sources here within the boundaries of San Diego County," he said.
