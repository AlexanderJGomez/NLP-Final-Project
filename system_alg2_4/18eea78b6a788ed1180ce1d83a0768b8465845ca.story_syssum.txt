Rome (CNN) -- Italian President Giorgio Napolitano said Wednesday that his country will adopt a series of austerity measures promised to the European Union, as officials try to allay investor fears and head off a eurozone debt crisis.
Investor confidence plummeted Wednesday when the yield on 10-year Italian government bonds rose above 7%, the level at which other European countries -- including Greece, Portugal and Ireland -- have sought international bailouts.
But Italian lawmakers, for their part, could approve the new austerity measures as early as Saturday, officials say, compelling Berlusconi to resign shortly thereafter.
"The global economy has entered a dangerous and uncertain phase," Christine Lagarde said in remarks prepared for delivery at the International Finance Forum in Beijing.
European markets also sold off and the euro slumped nearly 2% against the U.S. dollar.
On Tuesday, Berlusconi won a parliamentary vote approving a new budget that includes austerity measures sought by international lenders, but lost his majority in parliament.
"I cannot remember a time when events in Europe moved so swiftly.
Reform now or regret it forever."
Italy is the world's eighth-largest economy.
"Italy's debt level is sustainable, but it needs to implement policies that will support economic growth."
The 75-year-old business tycoon has been a dominant force since forming his Forza Italia party in 1994.
Now it is time for Alfano.
Berlusconi was referring to former Justice Minister Angelino Alfano, who has been known as his hand-picked successor.
Names being floated include political figures such as Gianni Letta, Berlusconi's chief of staff, and Mario Monti, a former commissioner with the European Union.
Other business figures such as Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, chairman of Ferrari, and Alessandro Profumo, former CEO of Italy's largest bank, UniCredit, are also considered candidates.
