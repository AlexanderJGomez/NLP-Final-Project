Angola, Louisiana (CNN) -- Prisoners in southeastern Louisiana are helping to fill sandbags and patch up levee holes along the swollen Mississippi in an all-hands-on-deck effort to keep the mighty river at bay.
"This is 18,000 acres -- this is as large as Manhattan," said Burl Cain, the warden at Angola.
Elsewhere in Louisiana, inmates in Pointe Coupee Parish have filled more than 110,000 sandbags, some of which were expected to be sent to St. Landry Parish, said CNN affiliate WBRZ.
Like many states, Louisiana is struggling to cope with the worst flood to hit the lower Mississippi River valley since at least 1937.
Mandatory evacuations were in effect Saturday in Happy Town and the Sherburne Wildlife Management Area, the St. Martin Parish Sheriff's Office said.
In just the St. Landry and St. Martin parishes alone, more than 3,000 people have evacuated, the governor's office said last week.
"I would hate to see what it would be like if I had to go somewhere else."
