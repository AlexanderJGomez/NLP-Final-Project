Introducing MS Turanor Planet Solar -- the world's largest solar-powered boat.
Featuring an expandable deck covered in over 500 square meters of solar panels, the 60-ton vessel is completely powered by the sun.
It's not the first time the high-tech vessel has made headlines around the world.
In May last year it also became the first solar-powered vessel to circumnavigate the globe, traveling at an average speed of five knots.
Unlike other diesel-powered ships, MS Turanor Planet Solar glides silently across the water.
It may also prove to be the beginnings of an epic adventure -- this time on the high seas.
