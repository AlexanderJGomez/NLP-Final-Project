(CNN) -- The White House confirms that Syria has crossed a "red line" by using chemical weapons in its war with rebel forces, prompting the United States to boost the "scale and scope" of its support for the opposition.
It is going to provide military support including small arms, ammunition and potentially anti-tank weapons to the rebels, according to two officials familiar with the matter.
The United States has also ruled out sending troops, or putting "boots on the ground" in Syria.
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel also ordered the deployment of up to 200 additional U.S. troops to Jordan in April as the violence spreads from adjacent Syria.
The United States is also deploying a Patriot anti-missile battery and F-16 aircraft to Jordan as part of military exercises taking place this month.
The United States also has deployed Patriot missiles to Turkey, which also borders Syria.
In the past, NATO has flatly ruled out military intervention and the United States has no plans to put boots on the ground.
"As for NATO, the Patriot deployment will ensure effective protection for Turkey against any missile attack, whether the missiles carry chemical weapons or not," he said.
The Navy also has warships equipped with Tomahawk missiles, which could be used to hit chemical weapons supplies.
Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said the United States could send troops to Syria if al-Assad's government fell, if needed, to secure chemical weapons.
