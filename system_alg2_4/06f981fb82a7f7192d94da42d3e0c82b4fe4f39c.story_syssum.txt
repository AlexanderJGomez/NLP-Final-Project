Bekaa Valley, Lebanon (CNN) -- In my nine years as a UNICEF ambassador, I've been to camps for people displaced by conflict.
Many of these refugees lived a middle-class life in Syria, where they had homes, jobs, electricity and plumbing.
They are living in tents constructed from discarded objects such as burlap sacks and plastic sheets.
I noticed one young girl who had dull, patchy skin.
More than a million people are in urgent need of humanitarian aid.
According to UNICEF, there are more than 270,000 refugee children who are not in school in the country; by the end of the year, the number could exceed 400,000.
But for the kids I met, and millions more like them all across the region, politics is the farthest thing from their minds.
UNICEF still needs $172 million this year to assist Syrian refugees across the region, which means programs to support these children are threatened.
They need our help to stay alive, to go to school and to be kids again.
