Neighbors say they had called police about suspicious activity at the home in the past.
Police say they went to the address once in 2000, before the alleged kidnappings, when Castro reported a fight outside his home, and in 2004, after two of the three women had disappeared.
They said something to her, and Castro "told her to get down.
"We called the cops," she says.
Samoylicz also said she saw a girl who would sit looking out an open window until Castro would come along and board it back up.
Police say the girl is Berry's daughter.
And another neighbor, Israel Lugo -- Annita Lugo's brother -- says he called police in 2011 when he heard yelling in the Castro home.
We cannot do this alone," police said in a statement after the women were freed.
"There's got to be much more to this story.
Given my experience in handling criminal cases, I can't believe that we're not going to find in the days ahead or the weeks ahead much more that unravels about this that blows your mind."
