But instead of doing all of that for basketball, these same students should say the heck with the games and put their energy, zeal and passion into two fundamental issues posing the most dramatic barriers to their college education: the rising cost of tuition and the lack of financial aid.
But marching and demanding a rollback of student tuition is just one front of the battle that students in college and high school should be waging.
Federal officials say the banks are reaping upwards of $9 billion a year in these subsidies, which include interest collected, and the Obama administration wants to push more of that money to students by increasing Pell grants and Perkins loans.
Reining in this perk for the banks won't lower the cost of college, but it will make it easier for many students or parents to pay for it.
So some of the very folks who should want students to get as much money as possible to stay in school are not always operating in their best interests.
Four students at North Carolina A&T decided they'd had enough of the segregated lunch counters in downtown Greensboro.
And back.
Over the course of our history, it has always been the nation's young who took to the streets, statehouses, college campuses and the halls of Congress to demand change.
If these banks are fighting against your best interests, they don't deserve your account.
Instead of talking about the latest celebrity news, use online media to galvanize and build a national movement.
If they are still in session, come up with a list of legislators not fighting rising tuition or who are in the pockets of Sallie Mae and the banks.
It's time to enlist them in this battle.
The time for action is now.
