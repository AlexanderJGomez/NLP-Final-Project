Although a "Doctor Strange" film was announced, Marvel didn't bring out Benedict Cumberbatch, who has been widely rumored to be in negotiations to play the powerful magician.
"We're opening up an entire new corner of the (Marvel) cinematic universe: the mystical," Feige said.
The new Captain America film, "Captain America: Civil War," will be released May 6, 2016.
In addition, Marvel announced a two-part "Avengers" film, "Avengers: Infinity War," due in 2018 and 2019.
"We wanted to do this at Comic-Con this year, and things were not set: 'Civil War' wasn't set; 'Guardians of the Galaxy' wasn't out yet."
he said.
However, Cumberbatch was a no-show.
In addition to his well-received "Sherlock" series, for which he won an Emmy this year, he's earned a great deal of Oscar buzz for his performance as cyberpioneer Alan Turing in "The Imitation Game," a drama about World War II codebreakers.
