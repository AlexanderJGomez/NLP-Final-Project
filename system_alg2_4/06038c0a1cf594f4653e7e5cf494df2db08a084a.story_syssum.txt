In Sanaa's Change Square, Yemeni security forces shot live ammunition at protesters, injuring 11, witnesses and field medical teams said.
Two of the injured are in serious condition, medical staff at the square said.
A security official said they were released about two hours later.
In Dhammar province on Sunday, more than 45 anti-Saleh protesters were injured when security forces sprayed tear gas to disperse them, eyewitnesses said.
Opposition officials told CNN their delegation was traveling to hear the ideas of the mediators, not to make an offer to the Yemeni government.
In a speech given Friday, Saleh said women who were protesting were violating Yemeni cultural norms that prohibit women mixing with men who are not direct relatives.
His comments angered many activists.
