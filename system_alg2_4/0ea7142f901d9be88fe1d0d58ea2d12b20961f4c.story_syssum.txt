GARDINER, Montana (CNN)  -- More than half of Yellowstone National Park's bison herd has died since last fall, forcing the government to suspend its annual slaughter program.
Government officials say the slaughter prevents the spread of the disease brucellosis from the Yellowstone bison to cattle on land near the park.
Previously, under the Interagency Bison Management Plan, wandering bison were sent to slaughter without being tested for brucellosis.
"The plan requires all of us to do two things: protect a viable wild bison population and reduce the risk of transmission of brucellosis from bison to cattle.
There is no documented case of the disease passing from bison to cattle, they said.
Yellowstone is the only place in the lower 48 states where a bison population has persisted since prehistoric times, according to the Park Service.
When the weather becomes too harsh and food becomes scarce, they often roam outside the park.
"Bison are bison.
There's limited tolerance for bison outside the boundaries of Yellowstone National Park."
Control of the bison population is essential, Davis said.

"It becomes a private property issue," said Davis, who has never had a bison encroach on his ranch.
And if you don't want a buffalo on your private property, you shouldn't have to have them there."
Federal and state officials said last week they will lease private land bordering the park where up to 100 bison eventually will be allowed to graze during the winter.
"It is our job to protect the viability of this population," the Park Service's Nash said.
"The Yellowstone bison population is healthy, it's strong, it's vibrant.
