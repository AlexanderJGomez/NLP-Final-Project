What's at stake is I-522, the initiative that would mandate labeling food that is genetically modified.
For Ben and myself, it's simple -- being honest with your customers is the foundation of good business.
Maine and Connecticut have passed mandatory GMO labeling laws.
In Washington, supporters of labeling have raised money from more than 13,000 contributors, with the median donation of $25 a pop.
If I-522 passes in Washington, it would be the first no-strings-attached legislation for mandatory labeling.
While I've been in Washington lending my voice to Yes on I-522 , Ben has been traveling around the country with StampStampede.org -- a grassroots movement of tens of thousands of people who are legally stamping messages on dollars that say "Not to be Used for Bribing Politicians" to support the national movement to #GetMoneyOut of politics.
The use of GMO ingredients in food is similar to the issue of money in politics.
