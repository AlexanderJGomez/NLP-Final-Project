(CNN) -- On most mornings, my better half wakes up around 5:30, throws on some sweats and heads to the gym before work.
But this notion that sexual orientation comes with a different and pre-ordained way of life -- as if we're all ordering the No.
Pro-family groups try to stop stable couples wanting children from adopting unloved orphans.
I'm no sociologist but I'm pretty sure those concerns are not exclusive to gay people.
Too often, discussions about gay people and gay rights focus on sex, as if a person's entire being is defined by his or her Hollywood crush.
This fixation has been the crux behind attempts to link gay men to pedophilia -- from John Briggs, a state legislator from Orange County who introduced the proposed ban on gay teachers in California, to the Catholic League's Bill Donohue, whose recent attempts to excuse the church for its global scandal coverup by seemingly blaming homosexuality -- and it's a tactic that is evil incarnate.
Being gay doesn't dictate how people live their lives any more than being straight does.
The truth is the only thing all gay people have in common -- you know, besides being gay -- is that we face continuous rhetorical, social and legal attacks for simply existing, thus potentially making something as mundane as bringing a date to a work function a fight-or-flee situation.
And yet, 145 years since the abolition of slavery, 90 years since women were allowed to vote and 20 years since the Americans with Disabilities Act, we're still involved in McCarthy-like investigations, holding Briggs-like elections and taking opinion polls based solely upon "what" someone is as opposed to "who" they are.
It's sad.
