Cairo (CNN) -- Military police poured into Cairo's Tahrir Square on Wednesday in hopes of stopping clashes between protesters and police, as the Egyptian government said a truce had been declared through a group of clerics.
Some army soldiers tried to stop security forces from shooting tear gas, but they were outnumbered.
Protesters reached Fahmi Street, which leads to the Interior Ministry, and were trying to surround the ministry, state-run Al-Masriya TV said.
During a lull in the street battles earlier Wednesday, CNN saw riot police embracing and kissing some young people who were taking part in the demonstrations.
Crowds have packed Tahrir Square since Saturday, calling for the nation's military rulers to step down immediately.
Saeed, of the Egyptian general prosecutor's office, said 312 people had been arrested since Saturday.
"She called me and said she was arrested by military. "
The students will be detained another four days as an investigation continues, said a spokesman for the office of Egypt's general prosecutor.
The chaos and fighting have raised new questions about Egypt's future less than a week before parliamentary elections are set to begin.
Demonstrators say they are concerned the military, which would continue to be Egypt's top authority until a president is in place, wants to keep a grip on the country.
Tantawi of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said the resignations were accepted, but the current government will remain as a caretaker until a prime minister is named to form a new government.
