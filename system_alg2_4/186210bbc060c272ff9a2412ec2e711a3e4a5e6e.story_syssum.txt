Wayne Rooney and Coleen McLoughlin are to be paid $5 million for the picture rights to their wedding.
One littered with fierce criticism from the British press, which has enjoyed nothing more than lampooning Rooney and McLoughlin for being 'common.'
It's all down to Rooney apparently, and nothing to do with her appearing to be quite a decent person, who did well at school and has cleverly managed to parlay some of her fame into various media and advertising projects.
Much to the media's fury, the couple have sold the rights to cover the wedding to OK magazine for a record $5 million.
The wedding might be over the top, with a private yacht and luxury jet for guests (they are covering the guests' costs), expensive plonk and a $200,000 wedding dress, but at least the couple have worked hard for what they have.
He finally got his chance when he saw her struggling to fix a broken bicycle chain.
He rode over to help, popped the question again and got a yes.
