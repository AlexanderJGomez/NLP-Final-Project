(CNN) -- It was a Cinderella story taken straight from the script of a Disney classic.
"Every day I drove underneath that Disney sign coming in here that said, 'Where dreams come true,' and that's just what happened this week," the 28-year-old told the PGA Tour's official website.
"I was happy that I was a PGA Tour champion.
It still isn't real."
