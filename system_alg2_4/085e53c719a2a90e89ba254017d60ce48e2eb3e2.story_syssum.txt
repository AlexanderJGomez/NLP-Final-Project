Most of these cases -- 208, to be specific -- have been linked to Ohio State University in Columbus, the city's health department said.
The outbreak originated in February with a cluster of cases at Ohio State.
But none were still in hospitals as of Friday, and no deaths have been linked to the disease, Amato said.
Mumps typically begins with a fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue and loss of appetite, which is followed by the swelling of salivary glands, according to the CDC.
Mumps isn't the only infectious disease outbreak that Ohio is dealing with.
Earlier this week, authorities reported 68 people had come down with measles in the state, part of what is already an 18-year high of measles cases in the United States.
