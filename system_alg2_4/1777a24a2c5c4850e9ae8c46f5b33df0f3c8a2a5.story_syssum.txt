Mitt Romney's savaging of Gingrich helped him to clinch Florida.
Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich will compete over who is the most conservative, and Ron Paul will push his unique brand of libertarianism.
The latest CNN/Time/ORC International Poll shows that Santorum is closing the gap on Romney in Arizona, but it's probably in Michigan that he stands the best chance of scoring an upset.
So it would serve Santorum well to hit Mitt hard in the debate.
One thing Santorum doesn't particularly need to do in the debate is make voters like him: They already do.
Poor Seamus apparently lost bowel control en route and ran away on arrival.
But Mitt has been countering the "weirdo factor" with a series of ads and personal appearances in Michigan that emphasize his local roots and his concern for the auto industry in a state beset by tragic levels of unemployment.
There will be a lot about how great American cars are, Mitt's experience as a businessman, Obama's relative incompetence and Romney's Michigan childhood.
But if Romney's reinvention as a human being does pay off, it will be because Republicans desperately want it to work.
A bit of passion and compassion in Wednesday's debate could be all the excuse wavering Republicans need to back a winner.
