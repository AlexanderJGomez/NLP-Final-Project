Introducing the Water Discus Hotel, a luxury multi-million dollar resort featuring 21 moveable rooms found in the heart of spectacular coral reefs.
The luminous hotel features two large disc-shaped lounges seven-meters above the water, housing a luxury restaurant and spa.
"A lot of people have said it looks like something from a James Bond film," said Podwojewski.
Not only does the hotel look like a spaceship -- it actually moves like one, with the largest underwater saucer-shaped room able to slide to the surface in emergencies.
"If you need to replace a window for example, it's very difficult underwater," explained Podwojewski.
There are also plans to rebuild coral reefs, by growing the vibrant eco-systems in a special plantation before relocating them around the hotel.
But it seems this unique underwater hotel will be much closer than you think.
