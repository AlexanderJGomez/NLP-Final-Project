On the day the new Ebola clinic in Liberia opened, ambulances waited outside.
One man opened his eyes weakly.
A little boy tried to walk out of another ambulance, but he too collapsed.
"Get up and go inside," workers told the boy.
When asked why no one from the hospital was helping them get inside, a hospital worker said staff was inside suiting up in protective gear.
When shown CNN's video of the patients collapsing, a WHO representative was horrified, but said the patients shouldn't have waited until they were so sick to seek help.
Graaff said he would try to find out why hospital workers didn't come help the patients.
It's horrible."
