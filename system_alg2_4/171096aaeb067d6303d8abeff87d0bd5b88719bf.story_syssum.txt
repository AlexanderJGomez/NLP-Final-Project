(CNN) -- Formula One's 12 teams have struck an agreement to secure the future of the sport until 2020, Bernie Ecclestone has exclusively told CNN.
In March the majority of the teams had agreed in principle to tie themselves to an extension of the Concorde Agreement that was most recently signed in 2009, but doubts remained over Mercedes.
"You'll have to wait to see if Mercedes have but I'm confident everything with Mercedes will be fine," Ecclestone added.
"I appreciate and support Mercedes probably more than anyone in F1," said Ecclestone.
Ecclestone also suggested that reports of Formula One listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange might be premature.
