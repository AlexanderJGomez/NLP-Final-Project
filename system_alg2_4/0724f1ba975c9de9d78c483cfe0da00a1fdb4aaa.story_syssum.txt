ACORN leader Bertha Lewis defends her group at the National Press Club on Tuesday in Washington.
ACORN workers who did perform their tasks properly "did not deserve to have co-workers who did not live up to their standards," Lewis said.
Just because we were embarrassed by these highly edited tapes, which don't tell the whole story again, and hopefully that will come out, doesn't mean that these people didn't break the law in order to embarrass and attack the organization," Lewis said.
Some of its voter registration workers were prosecuted, and some other employees resigned.
In the videos, some ACORN workers advised the undercover conservative activists how to set up a prostitution business involving underage, foreign girls.
Lewis contends the group also has been responsive to allegations that some canvassers falsified voter registration applications and turned in those who falsified voter registration forms.
Lewis acknowledged that the founder's sibling embezzled nearly $1 million from the group.
She said e-mails from Karl Rove, when he was Bush's top political adviser, show that ACORN was targeted to stop its voter registration efforts because "we were moving too many minorities to vote" and "changing the power dynamics" in local elections.
Such critics of the group believe "we needed to be stopped," Lewis said.
"Last week, members of Congress were asked, 'Are you now or have you ever been members of ACORN?
"I'm proud to say that they've made it clear to me that I will continue to be tortured for at least another year.
