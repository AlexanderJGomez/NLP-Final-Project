In a country where bleaching creams are frequently used to chemically lighten skin tone, one savvy entrepreneur is fighting against the disfiguring practice.
Alhaji Mustapha Oti Boateng: I started with Chocho cream -- the natural skin restorer and beauty soap.
AB: My father was a herbalist and my grandfather was a herbalist I tried to recall all those things that when I was young they sent me to the bush to collect.
The herbs that we have here have a real potency of curing... and when I started using them too I have realized that I didn't choose the wrong way of curing people.
CNN: Then after the printing press, came a stint in Japan...
I came back with about five buses and started a transport business, but unfortunately for me it was all accidents, one after the other.
So I decided that this work, I can't do it for long because if age caught up with me I can't go to the bush to carry those food stuffs, so I decided to try another thing.
AB: I went to the market and bought creams that are manufactured and produced by foreign countries, powders and perfumes, and went around announcing those things for sale and it was really doing very well.
We import them so at the time of importation you calculate based on the exchange rate, before the goods would arrive in the country, [sometimes] the exchange rate would shoot upwards.
AB: I'm not educated but I'm always happy when I see children in school.
You know here in Africa, it's not all people who get [the] opportunity to go to school.
We can always educate ourselves wherever we go.
