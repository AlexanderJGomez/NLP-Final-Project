President Obama's decision to target militants from ISIS -- which is now calling itself the "Islamic State" or "IS" -- operating in Iraq comes as a huge relief to the Iranians.
At first, there was nothing but silence in Tehran as U.S. F-18s on Friday began to target ISIS militants.
In the corridors of power in Tehran, where no opportunity is missed to condemn American foreign policy at every turn, the silence was tantamount to a roaring approval of Washington's intervention.
This was the first time since the U.S .airstrikes began that a senior Iranian official has spoken in such terms.
Tehran and Washington don't just agree on the need for airstrikes against ISIS.
They are also in agreement that Iraq above all needs a new political leadership and that Prime Minister Maliki has to go.
The fact is that Shamkhani was himself heavily involved in recent weeks to seek out an alternative to Maliki, including a trip he made to Iraq in late July to consult with various Iraqi political circles.
And in this equation, Maliki had become an unbearable burden for Iranian policy.
As far as the U.S. role in combating the Islamic State is concerned, the Iranian debate is likely to remain split between the moderates and the hawks.
The moderates like to focus on the practical challenge at hand in Iraq and ways that Tehran and Washington can collaborate.
But all the recent trends suggest that the moderate viewpoint in Tehran has the upper hand on the policy question of Iraq and how Iran can best serve its interests.
