"There's no stability and there's no dignity when you live in apartments that have nothing in them," said Mark Bergel, the organization's founder.
Thanks to A Wider Circle, Taylor now tucks her daughters, Genora, 7, and Anna, 1, into beds of their own each night.
Bergel witnessed the need firsthand 13 years ago as a volunteer distributing food to families around the city.
Today, Bergel's group operates two warehouses stocked with furniture, linens, clothing and toys, where families can pick out the items they need.
"Most people are in poverty because they were born into it," Bergel said.

"My goal is to help people find the hope that was missing in their lives, and to see the opportunities that are before them," Bergel said.
"I'm able to tell the hundreds of people who reach out to us for assistance each day -- and have been sleeping on the bare floor for years -- that I know how hard it is and mean it," he said.
"I want to help create the change that will enable people to rise out of poverty and enjoy the freedom and independence afforded to others," he said.
