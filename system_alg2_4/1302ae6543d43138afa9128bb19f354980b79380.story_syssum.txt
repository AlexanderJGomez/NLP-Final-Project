It's fitting that CNN's interview with the iconic music star is taking place at an iconic hotel, which is like a second home to the former Beatle.
"I feel like it's harder now for the celebrities," he tells CNN Entertainment Correspondent Kareen Wynter.
The celebrity of today is so documented that I think it's a lot harder now.
As one of two surviving Beatles, people are treating him like a living treasure -- and these days, he and Paul McCartney seem to be treasuring each other.
Nobody told me that he snuck in, and that he rehearsed with the band."
In recent weeks, Starr has been busy promoting "Ringo 2012," his 17th solo album.
When I'm not doing that, I like to paint, I like to watch TV, I like to go to the cinema, I like to do all that stuff.
I like to sort of work my way into the day, and then whatever comes along, I say 'yes' or 'no' to.
It is how it is now.
It was hard enough, and thank God, there were four of us to keep each other in some sort of reality.
Starr: Well, we did, because we all had our moment, and then John or one of them would look at me and say, "Excuse me?!"
There were only four people who understood what we went through, and it's down to two now.
Starr: How can there be?
Starr: Paul can do it.
Starr: Well, we had a great time at my birthday.
I have to be very definite about that because they will say, "Oh, is he coming?
It is not going to be the Beatles, you know?
Starr: It's good.
We love Nancy.
Starr: Great.
Very easy.
CNN: The Beatles came up during a tumultuous time.
America had to go through its change.
We would love to be able to say, "OK, it's a peace and love takeover."
Starr: A lot of young people love "Peace and Love."
I just keep it going because it is a second in my life to think, "Peace and Love."
So if you put all of those seconds together, then soon you have got some time and it will make a change.
