Specifically, Congress hasn't passed a budget in almost four years.
If members of Congress can't pass a budget on time, they wouldn't get paid until they did.
In fact, according to the Washington Post, Congress has passed spending bills on time only four times in the past 30 years.
But somehow, breaking the laws they set for themselves doesn't seem to be an urgent concern to these Congresscrats, despite the fact that the U.S. government spent $3.7 trillion last year (PDF).
Now, House Republicans have seized on this idea as part of their bid to extend the debt ceiling deadline until mid-May.
The proposal was the cornerstone of the "Make Congress Work" plan released last year.
"No Budget, No Pay" is a no-brainer.
According to the bill, if lawmakers didn't pass a budget by April 15, their pay would be docked and put in an escrow account until they found a way to work together on this front.
Congress is now the greatest single impediment to American economic recovery, in large part because a bloc of 50 or so votes on the far right seems enamored with playing chicken with our country's full faith and credit.
But the House GOP vote to at least extend the debt-ceiling deadline and impose a common sense measure like "No Budget, No Pay" is sign of sanity at the start of the second Obama term.
If patriotic conscience can't compel Congress to work together, maybe requiring them to have some personal skin in the game will inspire them to do their job.
