A new poll finds that Americans are sleeping less because of economic stress and demands of modern life.
Over the last decade, the poll indicates that a growing percentage of Americans is getting less than six hours of sleep and the number of people who get eight or more hours is dwindling.

"You may actually sleep four hours, but you're in bed for eight hours," said Drake, who is a board member with the National Sleep Foundation.
"That's a bad loan," Kavey said.
"Our society has valued people who brag about being able to function on very little sleep as a mark of someone who is aggressive, dynamic, successful," Kavey said.
"Well, forget that.
