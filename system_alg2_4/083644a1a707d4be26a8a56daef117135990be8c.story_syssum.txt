Peter Bergen says deals with the Taliban could further destabilize the situation in Afghanistan.
Sunday's New York Times ran an interview with President Obama in which he said that, just as the U.S. had made peace agreements with Sunni militias in Iraq, "There may be some comparable opportunities in Afghanistan and in the Pakistani region."
It's not only going to be more complex, but doing deals with the Taliban today could further destabilize Afghanistan.
Second, while Obama didn't talk about dealing with Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, it is worth pointing out the Taliban leadership, including Mullah Omar, has in the past several months taken every opportunity to say that it has no interest in a deal with the Afghan government.
And just last week, Mullah Omar urged the Pakistani Taliban to refocus their efforts on attacking U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan.
And he did.
Side deals done with the Afghan Taliban will have little or no effect on the fact that the command and control of the insurgency is in another country.
Seventh, "reconcilable" Afghan Taliban leaders have already reconciled to the government.
Eighth, while the Taliban was never a monolithic movement, it is much closer to al Qaeda today than it was before 9/11.
Al Qaeda was founded in Pakistan two decades ago, and bin Laden has been fighting alongside Afghan mujahedeen groups since the mid-1980s.
One could go on listing examples of the Taliban's ideological and tactical collaboration with al Qaeda, but the larger point is that separating al Qaeda and the Taliban is not going to be as relatively simple as splintering Iraqi insurgent groups from al Qaeda in Iraq.
But "jaw-jaw" with the Taliban won't work if they think they are winning as they do right now.
As a result, two Marine brigades and a mobile, well-armored Stryker brigade will deploy into the heart of the Taliban insurgency in southern Afghanistan.
