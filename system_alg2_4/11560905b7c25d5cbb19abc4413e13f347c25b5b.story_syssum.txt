(CNN) -- Ramiro Valdes, 77, is one of only four remaining original rebels led by Fidel Castro in the 1950s in Cuba.
The issue has become a political one, but regardless of the reason for the electricity shortages, experts warn that Venezuela faces a complete electric collapse if something isn't done soon.
Valdes has been with the Castro brothers from the beginning of the revolution and today is arguably the No.
"He's the one who makes sure most Cubans don't have access to the Internet," Bardach said.
There are plenty of qualified engineers in the country with the experience to fix the electricity shortfalls, he said.
"This man presumably came here to do things other than help us [with the electricity problems]," Betancourt said.
While Valdes may not be an energy man, he does have a background in government purchases, Carrasquero told CNN.
The Venezuelan government said that the Cuban team is simply one of several foreign teams that have been called to help.
In all, the Venezuelan government will invest more than $4 billion to fix the electricity problems, he said.
