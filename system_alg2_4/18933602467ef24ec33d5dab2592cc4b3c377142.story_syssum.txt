The Dayton, Ohio, VA clinic is contacting 535 veterans who received treatment during an 18-year period from a dentist who admitted to not washing his hands or changing gloves between patients.
Individuals sought by the center are known to have been treated directly by the clinician between January 1, 1992, and July 28, 2010, according to a release by the medical center.
Veterans could still receive care at other facilities, Sledge said.
The center is taking an "ongoing in-depth look at a lot of aspects surrounding the allegations," Sledge said.
