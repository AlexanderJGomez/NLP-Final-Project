"The North Dakota strict ban on abortions at the time when a 'heartbeat' has been detected -- essentially banning all abortions as early as six weeks of pregnancy -- cannot withstand a constitutional challenge," U.S. District Judge Daniel L. Hovland wrote in his decision.
The law, thought to be the nation's toughest anti-abortion measure, was signed by the state's governor last year.
He called the constitutionality of the law "an open question," saying the Supreme Court has never considered the "precise restriction" of the fetal heartbeat aspect.
But women should not be forced to go to court, year after year in state after state, to protect their constitutional rights.
Abortion was legalized in all 50 states in 1973 by the U.S. Supreme Court.
