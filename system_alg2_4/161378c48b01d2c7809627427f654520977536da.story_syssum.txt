For more than 25 years, Oh has lived with the guilt of knowing his wife and two daughters are being held against their will in North Korea because of a choice he made.
He says there was not a job nor medical help for his wife, just three months of what he calls, "lectures from day to night on North Korea ideology, history and brainwashing."
He was then freed and moved to South Korea.
Oh learned his wife and daughters, only aged 6 and 9 when they first moved to North Korea, were sent to a concentration camp as punishment for his defection.
His youngest daughter says, "I miss you dad, I don't know you and I need to grow up fast so I can help mum and I feel regret but now I can lift water buckets and wood very well."
Oh looks at the photos of his family.
He says he feels helpless and all his hopes now rest with the United Nations and the South Korean President.
South Korea has increased diplomatic pressure on Pyongyang.
And hope he will live to see his daughters freed.
