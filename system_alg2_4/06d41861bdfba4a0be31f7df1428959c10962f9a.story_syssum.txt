London, England (CNN) -- The three Pakistani cricket players at the center of a betting scandal have been summoned to meet their country's top cricket authorities in London, England, where the alleged fixing took place, team manager Yawar Saeed told CNN on Tuesday.
Haroon Lorgat, chief executive of the International Cricket Council, said he wants any action taken by Thursday, if at all possible, an ICC spokesman told CNN.
Investigators from the ICC, the sport's governing body, are already in the United Kingdom making inquiries into the allegations, the council said Tuesday.
"We have requested Interpol and Scotland Yard to provide us with [the] preliminary report, and we have asked for permission to send our team there," Malik told CNN.
Police have questioned four people over the scandal, Pakistani manager Saeed said Sunday.
The alleged scandal came to light Sunday when a British tabloid newspaper reported that two Pakistan players deliberately bowled "no balls" -- fouls -- during their four-day series with England.
The video of the meeting -- which the newspaper said took place Wednesday, the day before the match between Pakistan and England began -- is intercut with clips from the following two days, where the players perform as Majeed said they would.
The Pakistani players at the center of the scandal were free to leave the country, police said Monday.
The team manager refused to comment on the report that Pakistan players intentionally committed three fouls during the match.
He directed the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board to submit a preliminary report "immediately," Farhatullah Babar said, adding that Zardari asked to be kept informed about any British investigations as well.
It is the second allegation of corruption directed at the Pakistan cricket team this year.
