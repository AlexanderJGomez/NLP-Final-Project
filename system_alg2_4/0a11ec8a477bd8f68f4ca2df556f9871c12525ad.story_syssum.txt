(CNN) -- Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, known to many people more as an aggrieved movie character or perceived tax dodger than as an actual person, has finally spoken out.
But despite well-documented friction over the years, Saverin says he bears no ill will toward Zuckerberg.
Saverin has had little to do with Facebook in recent years.
Many saw it as a dodge -- a way to avoid paying U.S. taxes on his share of the company, valued somewhere around $2 billion.
I already paid and I will keep paying whatever taxes I owe based on my time as a U.S.
"It was hard for me, because of the life I built in the U.S., hearing from Eduardo that he had to give up on his citizenship," he said.
As for Facebook itself?
"I don't like showing my private life online," he said.
