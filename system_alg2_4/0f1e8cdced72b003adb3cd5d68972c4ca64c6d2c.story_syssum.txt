CDC quarantine officers met the plane after one of the 255 passengers was vomiting on the flight, officials said.
The sick passenger and his daughter were taken to a hospital for evaluation.
"The symptoms of one individual were found to be consistent with another, minor treatable condition unrelated to Ebola," the health department said.
CDC officials removed the man and his daughter while other passengers remained on board.
The two passengers were escorted by CDC officials in hazmat gear.
"He nudged me and asked me to get the flight attendant," Burchett said.
According to Burchett, a flight attendant asked the man where he was traveling from.
The sick passenger and the girl were taken to the back of the plane, Burchett said.
An announcement was made about a sick passenger.
Nearly two hours after the flight landed, Burchett said, an announcement was made: "Everyone can leave.
"My concern is, if this were something that were highly contagious, we did not seem to have a very good reaction plan," he said.
I hope we learn from it."
Costa said he had spoken with the man and his daughter before the flight left Liberia.
In a statement this week, the CDC said quarantine inspectors meet arriving aircraft and ships reporting ill passengers or crew to assist them in getting appropriate medical treatment.
"If the flight crew of a commercial aircraft arriving in the U.S. becomes aware of an ill person on board which may include a person with Ebola symptoms, the captain is required required by law ... to report the illness to the nearest U.S. Quarantine Station, who will arrange the appropriate medical response at the flight's destination airport," the statement said.
