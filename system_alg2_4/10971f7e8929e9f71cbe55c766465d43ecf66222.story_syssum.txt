The two situations -- protests in Ferguson and drunken violence in Keene -- are not equivalent.
A grand jury will decide any day now whether to indict a police officer, Darren Wilson, who shot Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, this past August.
Police aggression made the protests worse.
Yet, many on social media and some in the mainstream media continue to use the isolated actions of a small number of bad protesters to smear the entire community.
"Ferguson Thugs Harass, Verbally Abuse Police Officers," read a headline on the conservative website RightScoop.
Now, let's turn to white protesters: In mid-October, during the annual Pumpkin Festival in the small New England town of Keene, New Hampshire, some white college kids apparently had too much to drink and turned violent.
"It demeans Ferguson and St. Louis to compare them to Pumpkin Fest," Professor Donna Murch of Rutgers University told CNN.
The protesters in Ferguson were airing legitimate grievances through mostly peaceful means and yet were denigrated, while the rioters in Keene were merely part of a party that "spun out of control" -- never mind that those in Keene were reportedly drunk and dangerous and disproportionately violent.
Why?
No.
And there's more.
The same year football fans at the State University of New York in Cortland rioted even before the game started.
Why aren't we talking about the epidemic of sports-induced violence among white people?
We don't yet know what the grand jury in Ferguson will decide and how the community will respond.
And if there's any violence from a few angry demonstrators, let's keep things in perspective considering the marauding bands of rowdy white football fans and rioting Pumpkin kids.
