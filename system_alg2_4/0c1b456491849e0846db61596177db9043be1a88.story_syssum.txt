In a statement aired on a private Libyan television channel, one of the three main Zintan groups in Tripoli said that at least two members of the force defending positions at the airport were killed in a rocket attack.
The government in a written statement said early Tuesday that it discussed at an emergency session "a potential request for international forces to solidify the state's capabilities" at an emergency session.
Still the government on Tuesday called for an immediate halt to the fighting and for the militias to withdraw within a week at least 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the airport.
The government said the customs building, maintenance building and some national security department planes had been destroyed.
"This is a temporary measure," the United Nations said in a written statement.
The United Nations, which stood by the Libyan people in their revolution in 2011, will not abandon them as they seek to build a democratic state."
Other militias have tried to wrest control of the airport from the Zintan brigades for years.
Nine people were killed that day and 25 others wounded, the government said.
The U.S. State Department said this past weekend it was concerned the fighting could lead to widespread conflict and backed the new government.
