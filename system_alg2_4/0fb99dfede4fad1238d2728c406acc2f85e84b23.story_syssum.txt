Eric Shanteau said he felt angry when he found out he had testicular cancer.
You know, right after I started swimming it was, 'I want to make an Olympic team.
"I'm used to being in control of everything.
"I hope people understand that if I was in a different position with my test results, then I wouldn't have put off having surgery."
Once back from Beijing, Shanteau invited CNN to spend time with him the night before his surgery in Atlanta, Georgia.
"They send me their story and it helps me to learn that people are going through the same thing I am all over the world," says Shanteau.
Testicular cancer is diagnosed in about 1 in 300 men in their lifetime.
Shanteau says he experienced no symptoms of cancer and came across the tumor by chance.
He adds that although he had the "greatest excuse in the world" -- an Olympic dream -- to ignore the lump, he understood the importance of early detection.
"But if they feel something [physically] that they don't think should be there, it takes them a year to get to their doctor and that just is not smart.
"I think the operation went very well," Carney said.
"There is a small chance it could come back but I shouldn't need chemotherapy at this point, so I am really optimistic."
Eric says the cancer diagnosis gave him a different perspective on life.
It is really great."
Right now I'm just kind of taking it year by year and we'll see what happens."
