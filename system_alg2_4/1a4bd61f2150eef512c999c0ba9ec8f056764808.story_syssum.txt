It can also burn through 250 tons of highly polluting bunker fuel each day when at sea, but while berthed in Singapore last month the ship was trying its best to keep a low profile, at least in terms of its impact on the environment.
"The bigger the ship the lower the fuel consumption, that's one thing," said Thomas Riber Knudsen, Asia Pacific CEO of shipping line Maersk.
Built-in measures to make vessels more efficient are increasingly important believes Knudsen, as there is a growing awareness in the industry that it needs to take a long view on its environmental impact.
So far the most toxic of pollutants from ships, like sulfur dioxide, have been the main focus of the IMO program and also other regional regulations.
Maersk say that despite the financial sweeteners from Singapore's Maritime and Port Authority the company is actually losing money by using low-sulfur fuel that can cost twice as much as ordinary bunker fuel.
According to the company it removes not just sulfur dioxide, but also carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides.
"I would say a good 95% of (shipping industry green initiatives) is incentivized or is driven by international regulations," he said.
"The fact they remain high today is helping to get the opinion and the action done.
