(CNN) -- One half Indian, the other Pakistani, they are the most talked-about partnership in tennis.
But a showpiece clash at the notorious border crossing that hosts a nightly pageant between India and Pakistan's border forces would be the perfect way to carry their "Stop War, Start Tennis" campaign into the new year.
I just hope in the near future we can have that match at the border, that would be great."
"Right now we're trying to see if we can help tennis in both our countries, promote it and keep the sport growing as much as we can."
Joel Bouzou, president of the Peace and Sport Foundation, added of the proposed Wagah match: "The sport is ready for peace.
"Unfortunately there are not that many Pakistanis on the tour, and playing with an Indian was actually the most natural thing that came to me -- having the same language, most of the time having the same dinner, Indian or Pakistani foods in the evening.
"I've always told him I think he's the most popular Indian guy in Pakistan this year!
It's been a great journey so far."
