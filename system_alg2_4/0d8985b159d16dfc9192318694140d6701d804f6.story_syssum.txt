In recent days, Bitcoins have enjoyed a media buzz as the value of one Bitcoin jumped on several Bitcoin exchanges to more than $200 per Bitcoin.
As a result, Bitcoins seem to present the best of all possible worlds -- the convenience of modern digital payment technology and the stability of a fixed money supply.
The near anonymity built into the Bitcoin system keeps funds away from the prying eyes of tax collectors, who are getting ever better at shutting down tax havens.
So are Bitcoins the currency of the future?
That in itself should be a huge red flag.
An exchange based on trading kiddy cards does not seem like a sound foundation for a monetary system.
Even if the system is not one big scam designed to enrich its shadowy creators, it can be hacked and can break like any technology.
Rather than being a safe place to keep money, the exchange rate of Bitcoins relative to other global currencies has fluctuated wildly.
Bitcoins are not the first attempt to create digital money.
One can expect governments to throw up legal roadblocks to prevent such competition from cutting into the lucrative business of printing money.
Our banking system is as safe as it is because there are lenders of last resort who can create more money in a crisis to protect the entire system from collapsing in a liquidity crisis.
In short, Bitcoins look like quite a bit of trouble.
