(CNN) -- The Puerto Rico Police Department has a long pattern of violating citizens' constitutional rights through excessive force and unwarranted searches, the Justice Department said in a report released Thursday.
Puerto Rico has used excessive force that has violated and suppressed people's right to exercise free speech, the Justice Department said.
The Justice Department also found the police department fails to police sex crimes and cases of domestic violence, and discriminates by targeting people of Dominican descent.
The Justice Department also contends that there are problems not just with the way the Puerto Rico police department carries out its functions, but among the officers themselves.
The governor also said that police have been meeting with the Dominican community in Puerto Rico to address issues of discrimination in policing.
The Puerto Rico Police Department is the second-largest in the United States.
One refrain that federal investigators heard repeatedly in Puerto Rico is that they had to make a choice between preserving public safety and abiding by the Constitution.
Nationwide, there are 17 investigations such as the one in Puerto Rico against police departments in the United States, Perez said.
"With the facts laid bare, it is now the responsibility of the Puerto Rican government and the Justice Department to make sure the police abuse and brutality end as quickly as possible," ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said in a statement.
