Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- The man accused of killing 77 people in a bomb-and-gun rampage in Norway last summer said his actions were justified to save the country from multicultural forces as he went on trial Monday.
He is accused of setting off a bomb in central Oslo that killed eight people, then fatally shooting 69 people at a youth camp run by the ruling Labour Party on nearby Utoya Island.
And in court, he called the trial political and objected to the judge's friendship with a former justice minister.
Breivik sat in court without restraints, behind a bulletproof glass barrier set up to protect him during the six hours of proceedings.
The police were so close," said Jorn Overby, who rescued some 15 people from the waters off Utoya during the massacre.
But Breivik's defense will try to prove he was sane at the time of the killings, Lippestad said Monday.
It is important to Breivik that he be considered sane, Lippestad said after the hearing.
But lawyers for the victims said: "No one thought he was crying for the victims."
"It was an intense gratitude, Bekkedal said during a break in the proceedings.
In a report released this month, two court-appointed psychiatric experts said Breivik was sane at the time of the killings.
The victims on Utoya Island were among 700 mostly young people attending a Labour Party camp, the same camp Stoltenberg said he had attended every summer since 1974.
"It's we who should decide what kind of a society we want; it's not the terrorists," he said.
We didn't go down that road, and that was, I think, a big victory."
