People gather around the wreckage of a plane that struck a building in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi on Saturday.
He said that all four aboard the plane were Americans.
Just before the plane crashed, the listening devices went off and they could not communicate with the pilot, Peterka said.
Parris crawled out and Lehr, with the help of bystanders, pulled the pilot and the engineer out as the plane burst into flames, Peterka said.
No one on the ground was injured, Mwaka said.
