Patrick, 33, moved to Kalamazoo just six months ago from California, where she earned a medical degree and another doctorate, her family told CNN affiliate WXMI.
Later that night, an Indiana State Police trooper found her car abandoned off Interstate 94 in Porter, Indiana -- about a 100-mile drive southwest of Kalamazoo.

"We have scoured, searched, and looked at everything we could possibly look at -- all the exits, all the businesses, all the hotels," Strong said.
Patrick's disappearance shocked not only her friends and family, but also CNN's audience.
