(CNN) -- Bryan and Donna Scott married a year and a half after meeting on the beach in their home state of Florida.
By 2008, when recession caused many small businesses to close shop, the Scotts left their day jobs to grow the business, Barn Light Electric Company.
The company, based in Titusville, Florida, manufactures and sells vintage-inspired lighting fixtures and has expanded into other industrial-styled goods.
I didn't know if it was going to last," he said.
They've been married for 29 years, Scott said, and building Barn Light made them stronger.
"Second, find that unserved niche within your hobby and aggressively go after it.
The company bought the patents of old lighting businesses, including Benjamin Electric Manufacturing Company, and allows employees and customers to suggest ideas for new styles.
Johnny Bragg, manufacturing general manager for Barn Light and Bryan Scott's uncle, calls Barn Light the best job he's ever had.
Bragg thinks of his fellow employees as close friends, he said.
They "don't just leave because it's the end of the day but because they've done a good job for Barn Light."
Locals may see a new building and go "Oh, its Barn Light, they're getting bigger again," Barn Light's communications coordinator Betty Lynne said.
"He's one of the few people I know that loves going to work every day and loves what he does."
