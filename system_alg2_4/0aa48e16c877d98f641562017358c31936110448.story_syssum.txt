Introducing Triple Deuce, set to be the world's biggest superyacht at a whopping 222 meters (728 feet) long.
Nonetheless, building a yacht of this size is all about "boasting rights," said Craig Timm of 4Yacht, broker of the record-breaking project.
"Our client was concerned that if we built the yacht to 200 meters (656 feet), then someone would come along like Roman Abramovich when he built Eclipse at 163.5 meters (536 feet), and outdid Sheikh Maktoum's yacht, the 162-meter (531-foot) Dubai, by only 1.5 meters (5 feet)," explained Timm.
"So what they do is moor out at sea, and a small boat -- which is still enormous by the standards of ordinary mortals -- will take them to shore.
"Fifteen years ago a large yacht was 45 meters (147 feet)," she said.
"You have to understand that we're not talking about the top 1% -- in this instance we're talking about the 0.01%.
"Building the yacht at the shipyard will directly employ, at the minimum, 500 people for a period of three years.
"There is an enormous sense of injustice which is shared not just by the poor, but also by the middle class, towards the global super rich," he said.
So whether you call it confusion, or double standards, or hypocrisy, or whatever it might be -- we both abhor the lifestyles of the super rich and at the same time we are endlessly fascinated by them."
