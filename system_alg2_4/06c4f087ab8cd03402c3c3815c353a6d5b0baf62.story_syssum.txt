Berlin (CNN) -- More than 300 wounded Libyans will arrive in Germany to be treated in hospitals within the next 10 days in an operation approved by Libya's interim government, the German Foreign Ministry said Friday.
Four further planes were expected to land in German territory Friday.
Four days later, the first military plane arrived in Germany with dozens of wounded Libyans.
Many wounded Libyans had already received treatment in Tunisia, according to Blasius.
