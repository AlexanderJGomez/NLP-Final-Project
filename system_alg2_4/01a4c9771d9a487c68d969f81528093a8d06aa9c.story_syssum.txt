"The Taliban is down another 'shadow governor,' " the American source said of Salam.
Taliban fighters are resisting Operation Moshtarak, an allied military push into areas the Taliban control in southern Afghanistan's Helmand province.
They're not backing down," CNN's Atia Abawi reported from the battlefield, where she is embedded with U.S. Marines.
It will take NATO-led military forces "another 25 to 30 days to secure that which needs to be secured" in Helmand and a further three months to ensure insurgents are kept out of the area, British Maj. Gen. Nick Carter said Thursday in a briefing from Afghanistan broadcast by the Pentagon Channel.
There have been five casualties among the NATO-led forces during the operation, the forces said in a statement Thursday, without giving further details.
It said later that four ISAF servicemembers died Thursday -- two of them in an improvised explosive device strike; another after a separate IED attack; small-arms fire killed the fourth servicemember.
Across the border in Pakistan, four people were killed and five were wounded Thursday when a drone fired on a suspected militant compound in the country's tribal region, intelligence sources and a local political official said.
Salam was arrested in Pakistan, the Afghan government and Taliban sources said, but they named different cities as the location of his capture.
Salam is believed to be the Taliban commander for Kunduz, Omar said.
Yaqubi said Salam and another Taliban "shadow governor," Mullah Salih, were arrested last week in the Pakistani city of Peshawar.
Taliban sources and Omar said other suspected members of the Afghan Taliban were arrested with Salam, but their identities are not clear.
