Dante de Blasio, the son of New York City mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, is a typical nerdy, smart, shy 16-year-old Brooklyn boy.
But it's mostly not because of his anti-Bloomberg or I'm-for-the-small-man messages (although that matters).
Dante and his gravity-defying, nonconformist hairstyle helped signal to New Yorkers that his father, Bill de Blasio, understands equality, empathizes with the victims of systemic bigotry and is more than qualified to lead the most diverse metropolis in America.
To some black voters, Dante's afro reflected that this boy and by association his father, respected the civil rights struggle, since the afro is considered an icon for black pride and progress.
Tiana Parker, a pretty, sweet, shy 7-year-old Midwest girl with a big bow over her dreadlocks was criticized because at the Deborah Brown Community School where she is a student, "hairstyles such as dreadlocks, afros, Mohawks and other faddish styles" were not permitted.
Parker's parents pulled her out of the charter school and placed her in a new school where hopefully she can lead a hair hassle-free childhood.
Black hair is a repository for America's painful past and promising future.
Let's hope that one day, hairstyles from the black community will no longer trigger powerful emotions or suspicions.
