(CNN) -- In the blink of an eye, Uber has emerged as one of the most esteemed companies in the United States, soaring in recent days to a market value of $18.2 billion.
In contrast, Uber has embraced a take-it-or-leave-it approach that may be tough for consumers to swallow over the long haul.
Lack of transparency may be one.
It's a passenger procurement service for private car drivers.
The car drivers are Uber's actual customers.
Privacy is also a concern for consumers.
I am sure there are fellow riders who, like me, take issue with the company not disclosing their passenger rating in the Terms & Conditions or privacy policy for the app.
And, again, I may not be alone feeling more than a little uncomfortable asking my driver for my rating.
When asked about this in an email, Kasselman, responded: "Uber driver partners do not have access to any personal information through the platform, including credit card data.
Consumers both love and fear disruptive companies like Uber.
For Uber to get the value of its disruption, in the form of consumer goodwill, people will need to know why Uber-instigated changes in the taxi industry are good, not bad.
First, get very sharp about what you stand for and start building bridges with consumers that go beyond the functional role of delivering things from point A to B.
But the jury may still be out with consumers.
It must bring context to the chaos it creates and be known as a positive force for change that always acts on behalf of its consumers, not its business model.
Otherwise, down the road, a competitor might more easily turn my head: one that delivers exactly what they promise me.
