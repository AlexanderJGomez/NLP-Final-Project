Walls had been ripped open in this foreclosed home in Atlanta, Georgia.
In 2006, Ortega said, the property sold for $200,000.
"About a third of all of the foreclosed properties nationwide have been so damaged, either by the previous owners or by criminal gangs coming in after the foreclosure, that they no longer qualify for standard mortgage financing," Thomas Popik told CNN.
"In many cases, it costs so much to rehabilitate these houses, it's just not cost-effective," he told CNN.
"A lot of these homes have been vandalized," Dana Ash, an Atlanta, Georgia, real estate broker, told CNN.
The banks that own the properties, Ash told CNN, probably will not simply walk away from the homes.
"They will eventually sell.
A spokesman for the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington told CNN that unsalable homes are still a relatively small part of the national inventory of foreclosed properties.
