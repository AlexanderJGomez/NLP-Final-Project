(CNN) -- Gunfire and shelling rang out across Syria's coastal city of Latakia early Tuesday amid reports of Palestinian refugees fleeing a restive and impoverished enclave there.
Snipers perched atop various locations in the city's al-Ramel neighborhood, the site of a Palestinian refugee camp, he said.
"The tragedy of (Ramel) has not stopped since yesterday," the LCC said in a statement Tuesday.
The U.N.
Christopher Gunness, UNRWA spokesman, said refugees in Latakia had been asked to leave by the Syrian security forces.
The Syrian government vehemently denied reports that more than 5,000 Palestinians fled the refugee camp in the area after it came under fire from Syrian security forces.
The LCC said at least 2,545 people have died.
CNN cannot independently verify opposition or government claims because Syria has restricted international journalists from reporting inside the country.
