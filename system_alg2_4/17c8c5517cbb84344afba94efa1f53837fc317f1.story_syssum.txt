Syed Haris Ahmed, charged with providing material support to terrorism in the United States and abroad, used the time to talk about his Muslim faith instead of addressing the evidence against him.
"We worship the same God," Ahmed said.
Ahmed, a naturalized United States citizen who was born in Pakistan, waived his right to a jury trial so he could make the statement during closing arguments.
The judge told Ahmed he would act according to the laws of the United States in deciding the case by considering the evidence.
Ahmed and Sadequee made "casing videos" of landmarks in the Washington area during an April 2005 trip, McBurney said.
Before closing arguments, Defense Attorney Jack Martin argued the case should be dismissed.
"He's giving a closing argument," Ahmed said.
Martin said Ahmed moved to a suburban Atlanta neighborhood with his family when he was 12.
He did not have a religious mentor and turned to the Internet to find his identity as a Muslim, Martin said.
