What I didn't realize at the time was that soccer would do more for me than I could ever imagine.
Often, being the new girl on a team or being in a group breeds insecurities.
That's why I wrote the book series, "The Kicks," to show girls the importance of maintaining confidence when faced with new (and sometimes scary!)
I joined a team with women who I had looked up to for years, and at just 20, how was I supposed to fit in with them?
But I knew that I was capable of competing with them so I pushed myself outside of my comfort zone in order to be the best player I could be.
It's important that as women, we stand up for ourselves, stand up for our peers and show the power that confidence can have for women everywhere.
