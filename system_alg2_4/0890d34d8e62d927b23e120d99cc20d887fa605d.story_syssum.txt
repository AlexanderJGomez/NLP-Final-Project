Janet Napolitano surprised the nation and many of her friends with last week's announcement that she was being nominated for appointment as the 20th president of the University of California.
And now the first woman president of the nation's largest public university system.
Her great success in both jobs was to know how to play to their strengths to achieve common goals.
In the process, she has overseen the maturation of that department's "one-size-fits-all" security approach to one that matches the strategy to the threat: intelligence-driven and risk-based.
Napolitano is not a limelight-seeker.
She brought years of front-line experience to the immigration debate and was a central figure in the ongoing discussions of reform.
Janet Napolitano is also one of the warmest and most caring individuals I know.
One example among many: A longtime mutual friend who served as director of constituent services in her Arizona office was unexpectedly stricken with illness.
"[She] played a critical role in the Governor's Office," Napolitano wrote.
I suspect that as the administration looks to replace her, it will begin to grasp how much it will miss her.
