A cable dated January 2010 sent by then Charge d'Affaires Todd Chapman at the U.S. Embassy covered allegations about officials enabling drug trafficking by accepting bribes.
He obviously imagined I would never read what he had written," the source told the state-run Agencia de Informacao de Mocambique (AIM).
Chapman wrote that his source had told him the country's ruling party, FRELIMO, "brazenly squeezes the business community for kickbacks."
In March 2009, the U.S. Embassy in Lima sent a dispatch insinuating that a regional Army commander, General Paul da Silva, was involved in drug trafficking.
The accusations in the Mozambique cable echo comments in several others from the country between July 2009 and January of this year.
The State Department would not comment on the leaked cables that were supposedly authored by Chapman.
A high level law enforcement official admits most police drug seizures are not reported to his office because traffickers and police make on-the-spot arrangements to allow the drugs to continue to flow."
Suleman strenuously denied the allegations in a news conference, saying he had never been involved with drugs.
A cable from July 2009 said a source within FRELIMO had described a customs official as "the King of Corruption."
The official's office told CNN he was on vacation and wouldn't be available for comment until later this month.
