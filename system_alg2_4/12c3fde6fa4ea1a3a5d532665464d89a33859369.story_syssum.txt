Suze Orman says it's a good thing the federal government bailed out troubled national insurer AIG.
Larry King: A few months ago, you said on this very show that you would be worried if there was another big government bailout.
AIG is an international giant that just doesn't have ramifications here in the United States.
It is worldwide.

The major danger that we had here, which is why you saw the stock markets go up today, is that rumors were circulating that AIG was going to be saved.
Why were they lending money to people who shouldn't have been borrowing money?
Why weren't the rating agencies rating everything the way they should have been and now they're making matters worse?
Orman: No.
If you just got an inheritance and you have $50,000, should you be putting it in the stock market now?
What does that mean?
Are gas prices going to go down?
Lehman, AIG -- I get that's all bad news, but the good news is for the main people that have to get by every single day.
Orman: I personally think it was bad.
If we had lowered interest rates, the Fed funds rate, the banks would have been making more money on the money that they lent out, which would be helping everybody in the long run.
You would think that they couldn't, but when you see dinosaurs -- Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, AIG -- going down the drain, anything can happen.
