Oh, good.
It's not the first email you want to open in the morning.
Anthem, which is the second largest health insurer in the United States, said on Thursday that as many as 80 million customer records were stolen.
But when it's your inbox, your data, something about it feels different.
But it was enough of a motivator for me to call up a couple data security experts to dig into this a little bit.
The hackers "don't need to be bigger-better-faster because we're not doing the basics" to protect customer data, he said.
The vast majority of these incidents could have been completely prevented if (the companies who store data) had been doing the basics."
I called someone with that point of view and Avivah Litan, a cyber security analyst at Gartner, said she doesn't think it's fair to blame Anthem for the stolen data.
Anthem also did the right thing by alerting me and other customers, she said.
I'm the one who got the email ...) If your credit card data is stolen, she said, there are easy ways to rectify the situation.
And they'll give you the money back," she said.
If she were an Anthem customer, the hackers have "my name, social, date of birth, address," she explained.
There's more.
Both security experts did share one answer: the Social Security number itself.
"You need to make this data useless when it's stolen," she said.
And Litan explained to me that there may be a way for health care companies, and other industries, to use a hard-to-crack proxy for a Social Security number in place of the real thing.
And unlike email and social media accounts, where stronger passwords and two-step verification systems help, there's no way consumers can rework the IT infrastructure of a major company like Anthem.
Or making this data worthless to criminals.
Litan told me.
