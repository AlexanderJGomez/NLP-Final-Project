Experts on the region said Tuesday Abdullah's decision was aimed at warding off larger-scale demonstrations in the wake of the huge protests in Tunisia and Egypt.
There was a series of protests in Arab nations in the 1950s, but those were prompted by an ideology of Pan-Arabism in a post-colonial world, said Emile Hokayem, with the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
A 2005 uprising in Lebanon was about independence and ousting Syria.
It's very different," said Hokayem.
Abdullah's decision and Assad's remarks "are preventive moves," said Hokayem.
When the Tunisia protests proved successful at first, many analysts still doubted a "domino theory" would play out through the Middle East, said Hokayem, because each nation has a different structure, population, and set of challenges.
"I still think that monarchies have an edge in terms of legitimacy," Hokayem said.
The United States views Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia as key allies in the region.
"If Saudi Arabia starts to see popular protests," said Hounshell, "then you're really going to see people in Washington freak out."
