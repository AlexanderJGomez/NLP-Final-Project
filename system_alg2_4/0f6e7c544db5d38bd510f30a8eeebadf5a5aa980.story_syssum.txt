WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The United States ambassador to Afghanistan, William Wood, said Friday that changes in communications with Afghan military forces have been made in the aftermath of a disputed U.S. air raid on an Afghan village.
A number of investigations into the incident are under way, including a "senior level" review by the United States.
"Speaking as an official of the American government, I can say there is no one who works harder than the United States does to minimize such casualties.
The ambassador said the United States has made changes in communication between the U.S. and Afghan forces.
"The United States delegation expressed regret over the loss of any innocent civilian lives incurred during security operations," the statement said.
