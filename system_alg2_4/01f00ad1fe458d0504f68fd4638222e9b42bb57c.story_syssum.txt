ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Rawalpindi's police chief stopped doctors at the hospital where Benazir Bhutto died from conducting an autopsy, according to a lawyer on the hospital's board.
The revelation came on Monday after new videotape of Bhutto's assassination emerged, showing her slumping just after gunshots rang out.
A previously released videotape showed a man at the right of her vehicle raising a gun, pointing it toward Bhutto, who was standing in her car with her upper body through the sunroof.
Pakistan's Interior Ministry announced on Friday that Bhutto died from a skull fracture suffered when she fell or ducked into the car as a result of the shots or the explosion and crashed her head onto a sunroof latch.

In the letter, Minallah said the doctors "suggested to the officials to perform an autopsy," but that Saud "did not agree."
Cheema said the government had no objection to Bhutto's body being exhumed for an autopsy if the family requested it.
Minallah said the family could not have prevented an autopsy at the hospital without getting an order from a judge.
"Sharp bones edges were felt in the wound," it read.
