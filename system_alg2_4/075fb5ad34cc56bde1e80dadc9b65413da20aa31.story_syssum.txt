"I just saw an opportunity -- my mom is going through a divorce and I don't need this last name anymore," explained 30-year old entrepreneur Jason Sadler, who lives in Jacksonville, Florida.
The bidding ended December 13 on Sadler's website -- buymylastname.com -- and the winning bidder will pay $45,500 for Sadler to change his name to Jason Headsets.com.
For all of 2013, Sadler will legally assume the new surname decided by the winning bidder and will need to change all official forms of identification.

I live in this kind of online marketing world and I'm very passionate about it.
"I had some legalese written up.
It's just not going to happen.
