PARIS, France (CNN) -- Debris from Air France 447, which crashed en route from Brazil to France last month, killing 228 people, has arrived in France, the French air accident investigation agency BEA said Wednesday.
The search for the data and voice recorders from the plane entered a second phase last week, according to France's accident investigation agency.
On July 10, two U.S. naval vessels and the French Navy submarine called off their search for the recorders, which investigators hope will shed light on exactly how and why the plane crashed.
"We want to stress that for the sake of the families, we hope that the search for the black boxes will be successful," an Air France representative told CNN.
The mountainous ocean floor in the search area ranges from 3,280 to 15,091 feet, BEA officials have said in the past, making the search for the recorders -- and the rest of the plane's debris -- difficult.
Brazil called off the search for bodies on June 27, having found 51 of the 228 people who died, according to the military.
