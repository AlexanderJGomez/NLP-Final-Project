A controversial new Texas law requiring voters to present personal identification before going to the polls has been blocked by the Obama administration.
Texas' new voting boundaries for congressional and legislative seats are also being challenged separately in federal court.
Thus, we conclude that the total number of registered voters who lack a driver's license or personal identification card issued by (the state Department of Public Safety) could range from 603,892 to 795,955," Perez said in the letter, addressed to the director of elections for the Texas secretary of state.
A similar voter ID law in South Carolina was blocked by the Obama administration in December.
Those lacking an acceptable identification would be given a free voter identification card.
Opponents of the voter ID law in Texas have said minority voter turnout could be suppressed 3% to 5% at a time when the Hispanic population there is growing rapidly.
The Justice Department said Hispanic registered voters in Texas are 46.5% to 120% more likely than a non-Hispanic registered voter to lack the required identification.
That explosive growth ensures Texas will gain four congressional seats, requiring new voting boundaries that are still being litigated in court.
