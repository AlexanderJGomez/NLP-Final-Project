Washington (CNN) -- Forced federal spending cuts have had a "devastating impact" on judicial operations nationwide, prompting a request to Congress for emergency funds to keep operations going at minimal levels, court officials say.
"If sufficient funding is not provided to the courts, we cannot provide the people of the United States the type of justice system that has been a hallmark of our liberty throughout the nation's history," Gibbons said.
"All aspects of court operations have been severely curtailed" as a result said Gibbons, a federal appeals court judge in Memphis, who also heads the administrative conference's Budget Committee.
Judicial officials have already begun implementing staggered cuts to such areas as staff salaries, court security and federal public defenders.
