I'll spend hours just surfing the Web, searching for details about old high school acquaintances, co-workers and potential dates.
Seriously.

Well, Creeper(?
Are you a creeper?
Does your colleague have a website?
)?
I saw your website.
I love 'Born This Way,' too!"
"And I would love to take you out for a steak and my namesake sometime."
Are you a creeper?
It's totally fine to do an initial Google on someone you just met (especially somewhere like a bar or online) simply to make sure that s/he is, in fact, who they say they are.
If he sucks at his hobbies (or had an unhealthy fascination with the destroyer of bloodsuckers), at least give him a chance to charm you before you can write him off without his knowledge.
A story: Back in 2009, American Girl put out a doll named Rebecca Rubin -- a young Jewish girl from New York's Lower East Side.
A simple Google search by an American Girl employee could have waylaid that issue.
Nowadays, when anyone can and will search for you online -- you're not the only one, Creeper(?)
That way, the minute an article about a head-collecting serial killer who shares your name hits the Web, you'll know why that guy you met at that bar never called you.
Then the FBI will take care of that for you.)
