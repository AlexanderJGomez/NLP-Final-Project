(CNN) -- Jason Dinant has the opposite problem of most Americans -- he has flat abs.
"I don't have that much body fat, but it tends to stick right here in my stomach," he said pinching his belly.
"I give reports without a shirt on, so I should have the best body," he said.
"There are go-go boys and girls with killer stomachs," Dinant said.
Now Dinant works out four times a week in a gym inside his apartment complex, cycling on a stationary bike, using weights on his upper body and doing 500 sit-ups a day.
But the sit-ups get old, Dinant said.
"For men, we have to put abs under weight resistance to make them stick out."
To make those stomach muscles bigger, "abs have to be put under resistance," Dothard said.
Dothard demonstrated these moves on a video.

Even with a normal body mass index, people can carry extra weight in their stomachs, which increases the risk for cardiovascular disease.
"I have my 10-year high school reunion coming up," Dinant said.
