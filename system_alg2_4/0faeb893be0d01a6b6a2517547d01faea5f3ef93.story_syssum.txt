Randoseru, Japan's traditional schoolchild's backpack, has become the latest must-buy souvenir in Japan.
Its popularity among foreigners gained traction earlier this year when Zooey Deschanel was spotted in New York sporting a red randoseru.
Yorozu tells CNN that the shop now sells about 120 randoseru each month.
Seiban, a randoseru manufacturer, has also seen an increase in foreign shoppers at its randoseru shop in Tokyo's Harajuku area.
