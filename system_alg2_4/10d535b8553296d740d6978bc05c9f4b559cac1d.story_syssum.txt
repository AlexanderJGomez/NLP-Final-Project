(CNN) -- As both President Obama and Mitt Romney make the case for creating jobs, they are ignoring one of the fastest-growing job creators in our economy: the nonprofit sector.
Taken all together, the sector generates almost $1.5 trillion in spending per year and employs about one in 10 American workers, or 13.5 million people.
In comparison, for-profit jobs declined by 0.6% per year during the same period.
At the same time, businesses averaged jobs losses of 3.7% per year."
One might question whether jobs created in the nonprofit sector are really private-sector jobs, since many of the jobs are subsidized by the government through tax-deductible donations and direct grant support.
But the truth is that many private-sector businesses receive tax credits, tax deductions, government grants and government contracts.

If nonprofits could receive tax credits, they could sell in a secondary market to businesses to grow more jobs.
