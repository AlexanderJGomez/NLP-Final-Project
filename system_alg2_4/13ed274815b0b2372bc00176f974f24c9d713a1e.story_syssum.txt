Lorna Irungu, 35, had to travel from Kenya to India to receive her third kidney transplant.
"I was just tired.
Irungu says what she couldn't find was a doctor who would do the tricky third transplant in her own country of Kenya.
It's $45,000.
The cost of a kidney transplant in the United States can be $25,000 to $150,000, also out of Irungu's price range.
"When she called me from Kenya, she was very sick," Kher said.
Of the 1,500 kidney transplants performed at Fortis Hospital, doctors remember having done only two in which the patient was having a third transplant.
Doctors had to remove one of the previously transplanted kidneys to make room for the new kidney, Kher said.
Irungu said.
"From my experience, the cost here and the quality of care is worth it," Irungu said.
