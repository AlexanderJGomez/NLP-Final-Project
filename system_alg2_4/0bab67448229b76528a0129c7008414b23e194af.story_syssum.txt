O'Brien described a meeting between Bulger and a man who owed him money.
"What's that?"
O'Brien said he was an "independent" bookmaker, or unaffiliated with a crime organization, when Bulger summoned him to a meeting to discuss joining the Bulger group.
Thus began a 14-year relationship, with O'Brien testifying he paid Bulger's group a couple of thousand dollars, cash, in "rent" virtually every month.
Bulger never personally took the money, which was always paid in cash.
He said before he left for the meeting he told his daughter, "If I'm not back in 12 hours go to the FBI in Miami.
Don't go to the FBI there."
Bulger's lawyers also are trying to establish that Bulger was never a paid informant for the FBI and that instead Bulger was the one paying rogue agents for information.
Bulger was in hiding for 16 years before he was captured in Santa Monica, California, two years ago, living under a false name with his girlfriend in an apartment in the oceanside city.
