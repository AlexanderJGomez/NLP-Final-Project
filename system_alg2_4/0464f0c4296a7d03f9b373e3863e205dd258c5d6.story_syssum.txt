It also comes from groups and individuals -- male and female -- who long to see more women headlining major Hollywood films.
No.
Putting women front and center in film is the exception, not the rule.
Doing so, however, may dismiss the lack of diversity that persists onscreen and behind the camera in Hollywood movies.
In 2013, only 29% of 4,506 speaking characters evaluated were female.
Across top-grossing films from 2002 to 2013, only 4.2% of all directors were female.
Only three black women were directors across 700 popular movies between 2007 and 2014.
For female directors, the financing structure, subject matter, and even perceived confidence of filmmakers creates a barrier to career progress.
Applied to Hollywood, the rule would stipulate that women and candidates from underrepresented backgrounds be considered or even interviewed when hiring film directors.
While not every story should or can be female-dominated or focus on underrepresented racial and/or ethnic groups, examining a slate of content will reveal where and when stories about diverse groups and individuals are valued and told.
Sealing up cracks in the development, casting and hiring pipeline for women and underrepresented groups, however, should result in an onscreen reality that is more representative of the world we live in.
