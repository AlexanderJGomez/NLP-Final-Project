"How kind of you to send me a cable of sympathy from New York on our safety," Duff-Gordon writes in a letter that will go up for auction Wednesday in Boston.
Isn't it disgraceful?"
Rumors that the Duff-Gordons tried to deter the crew from making other rescues were never corroborated, but Lucy Duff-Gordon later said  her husband was "brokenhearted over the negative coverage for the rest of his life," according to a release from RR Auction, the house responsible for the sale of the letter.
A letter by Grateful Dead front man Jerry Garcia sent to a a former Vogue cover model whom he met at a New York party in 1980 will also go up for sale.
