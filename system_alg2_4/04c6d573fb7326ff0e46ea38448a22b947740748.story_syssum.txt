In Detroit on Monday, Al Gore endorsed Sen. Barack Obama for president.
Amid thousands of cheering supporters, Gore began by addressing head-on the criticism that Obama doesn't have enough experience to lead the nation.
Saying he will do whatever he can to support Obama's bid for the White House, Gore said Obama has "inspired" him.
"Take it from me, elections matter," Gore said.
"If you are a wounded veteran, you know that elections matter.
"After the last eight years, even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter," Gore said, adding, "After eight years of lost jobs and lower wages, we need change.
"This election isn't about changing the past, it's about changing the future," he told The Associated Press on Monday evening.
