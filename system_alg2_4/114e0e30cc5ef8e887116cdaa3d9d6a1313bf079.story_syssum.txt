Five men face charges in the alleged attack, police said Thursday.
All five began to assault Yavuz and his co-worker, Yuksel Cebeci, Yavuz said.
Cebeci was treated for broken fingers, Yavuz said.
The men were arraigned on Wednesday, and November court appearances have been set, the district attorney's office said.
A surveillance video from the gas station is in the hands of prosecutors, officials said.
