Anti-abortion protesters plan demonstrations this weekend outside Dr. LeRoy Carhart's clinic in Bellevue, Nebraska.
It's been nearly three months since Tiller, one of the world's most well-known doctors performing abortions, was shot in the head at point-blank range on May 31 as services began at Reformation Lutheran Church in Wichita, Kansas.
Operation Rescue President Troy Newman has vowed a peaceful demonstration and said that any hints of possible violence are ginned up by what he calls left-wing groups and the liberal media.
"Operation Rescue has said Dr. Carhart is the next target ...," said Katherine Spillar, executive vice president with the Feminist Majority Foundation.
Newman said earlier, "I'm not interested in putting our folks in any situation where the other side might flare up.
He said he abhorred the killing of Tiller.
He said he was confident his organization would have shut down Tiller this summer through a legal battle.
Tiller was one of about a dozen U.S. doctors who performed late-term abortions.
Carhart has vowed to open an office in Kansas and said he'll keep doing abortions as long as he's healthy.
Staring across the room at a poster of Tiller, he said, "I don't want his death to be in vain.
The outside of his office has the name of his clinic in bold letters: Abortion & Contraception Clinic of Nebraska.
"I do abortions, and that is what I do," he said.
Mark Gietzen, the driver of a truck for Operation Rescue, beamed with pride ahead of the protests.
"When they're ready to accept our position, then we'll sit down.
We say choice is right.
