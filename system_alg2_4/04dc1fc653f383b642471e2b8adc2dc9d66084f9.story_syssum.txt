Jerusalem (CNN) -- Police who are investigating a major wildfire in northern Israel have detained a 14-year-old boy who admitted smoking a water pipe in the woods near his village, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
"I do not want delays," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday.
I want quick solutions.
The Finance Ministry will allocate 60 million shekels ($16 million) in aid to local communities affected by the fire.
A plan will also be formulated to restore animal and plant life affected in the Carmel Nature Reserve.
They tried to escape but were burned alive," the spokesman said.
The fire has also threatened a sensitive ecological area near the Hai Bar nature reserve.
