Barcelona earlier defeated Getafe by the same scoreline to move eight points clear at the top, but Jose Mourinho's men responded by beating Atletico for the fourth time this season.
Striker Sergio Aguero finally scored a deserved goal in the 86th minute after a well-worked one-two with Koke inside the penalty area, but Atletico did not seriously threaten again in the three minutes of time added on.
But with the likes of Lionel Messi and David Villa in the line-up, the Catalans always had too much firepower against a team which has slumped out of European qualification contention.
In Saturday's other game, Real Mallorca moved up to ninth place with a 1-0 win at home to Real Zaragoza, who remained four points above the bottom three.
Third-placed Napoli can cut Milan's lead to three points by beating Cagliari in Sunday's late match.
