(CNN) -- During the past few months, I have gently suggested to my patients that they receive the flu vaccine.
More patients need to be protected against influenza by getting flu shots earlier in the season.
Severe flu complications, like pneumonia, can hospitalize these patients, or worse, be fatal.
According to William Rodriguez, a pediatrician at the Food and Drug Administration, between 43 and 153 children have died in the past 10 flu seasons combined.
But another reason is the relatively low percentage of patients who received a flu shot.
The reason many cite, "I got the flu from the flu shot!"
In some, the flu can be debilitating, leaving patients bedridden for days.
But it's still the flu and can be spread to more vulnerable patients, with disastrous consequences for them.
But patients can also help.
Then be proactive and get a vaccine earlier in future flu seasons.
