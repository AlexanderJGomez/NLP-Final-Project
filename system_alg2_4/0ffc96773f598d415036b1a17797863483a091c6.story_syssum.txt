(CNN) -- Chuck Klosterman's seventh book and second novel, "The Visible Man" (Scribner), is out Tuesday.
CNN spoke with Klosterman about the inspiration for the book, writing about and participating in the interview process, and how no one is going to relate to the two main characters in his new novel.
The thing that was most interesting to me was that the invisible man was such a jerk.
He was just this kind of egocentric, weird person.
So those two things together sort of ended up becoming this book.
Klosterman: No.
But here's the trick, or, I guess, the paradox: Even though interviewing is this incredibly flawed process, it's still the best means we have for understanding people we don't know.
Klosterman: What else would I do?
Maybe he charms you, maybe you see something in him, maybe you don't like him.
To me, if someone had never written a book before and was now attempting to write a book based on the fact that they had one metaphysical encounter, that would be their fear.
That's one of the weird things about this book.
I can't imagine someone reading this and going, "I really relate to this man or this woman."
I'm just thinking about it constantly.
I mean, it's kind of a cliche thing; it seems like something you worry about when you're 17, but I've never stopped worrying about it.
Klosterman: Both.
Like, "Am I really writing a book?"
If someone says, "'The Visible Man' is about a man who becomes invisible," does that bother you?
I think that, in general, when I write nonfiction, I want it to seem like hyperreality, for it to feel like you're reading fiction.
But when I write fiction, I want it to seem like journalism.
