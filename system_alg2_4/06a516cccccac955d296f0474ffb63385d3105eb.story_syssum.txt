It reports that sales of his latest album, "Unorthodox Jukebox," rose by 164% after Mars took to the Super Bowl stage with the Red Hot Chilli Peppers.
In 2010, he won a Grammy for best male pop vocal performance for his song "Just the Way You Are."
In January, "Unorthodox Jukebox" won Mars his second Grammy, this time for best pop vocal album.
