(CNN) -- Wednesday's decision by the U.S. Patent Office to repeal six federal trademarks of the Washington Redskins on the grounds that the name is "disparaging to Native Americans" is, of course, a victory for the Native American community and our allies.
Should team owner Dan Snyder's appeal to the U.S. Patent Office fail, then we can celebrate even louder -- and even louder when the name is changed.
Bailey even likened the team name to the n-word.
"When you hear a Native American say that 'Redskins' is degrading, it's almost like the N-word for a black person," Bailey told USA Today Sports.
Yet this issue is bigger than the Washington Redskins.
This is a campaign of dignity and humanity.
Empirical study has proven that Indian mascots harm the mental health of Native American children.
But that's not quite accurate.
Harjo and even the late American Indian Movement leader Russell Means fought against the name as well as all manner of Indian mascotry for decades.
It's not that names matter more, it's that when we talk about death rates, rape and epidemics in Indian country we don't always get a response.
