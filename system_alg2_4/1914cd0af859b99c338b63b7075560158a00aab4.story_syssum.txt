WASHINGTON (CNN) -- House Democrats on Thursday failed to override President Bush's veto of a children's health insurance bill that opponents said was too expensive.
"Now is the time for Congress to stop playing politics and to join the president in finding common ground," said a White House statement after the vote.
Bush proposes increasing the program by $5 billion.
See veto record Â»   On its first go-round, the House passed it with 45 Republican votes -- about two dozen votes short of the two-thirds majority.
"The American people support this issue because kids do not need to suffer for what is basically a broken health care system, and this provides those children  with that health care," Emanuel said.
The bill the House and Senate passed in September would extend eligibility for the program to about 4 million more, paying for the expansion with a 61-cent-per-pack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes.
"I made clear that, if putting poor children first requires more than the 20 percent increase in funding I proposed, we'll work with Congress to find the money we need," said the president.
But they just ran the bill, and I made it clear we weren't going to accept it."
House Republican leaders have complained that Democrats postponed the override attempt for two weeks to use the issue for political advantage.
Meanwhile, of the eight Democrats who voted against the bill in September, only one has said he will reverse his vote and support an override.
Democratic Rep. Diane Watson of California, who declined to vote on the original bill, has agreed to vote for the override, House Democratic Whip Rep. Jim Clyburn said.
