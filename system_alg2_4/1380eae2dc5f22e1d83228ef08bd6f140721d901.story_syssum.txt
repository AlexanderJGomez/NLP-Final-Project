Washington (CNN) -- Thousands of protesters held hands and encircled the White House grounds on Sunday, demanding President Barack Obama reject a proposed oil pipeline that would stretch between Canada and Texas.
"We need to remind him he is the leader who we elected," Courtney Hight, a former member of the White House Council on Environmental Quality and now executive director of the Energy Action Coalition, told the crowd.
"I'm hoping to God that the president, or whatever higher power, will use rational sense and understand that people don't want this," Willa Tharnish, a senior and environmental studies major at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, said of the project.
TransCanada says it "is devoted to minimizing its environmental impact" in creating and operating Keystone XL.
The process threatens rivers and communities along the way, said the group, which was one of the chief organizers of Sunday's event.
"Folks in Nebraska, like folks all across the country, aren't going to say to themselves, 'We're going to take a few thousand jobs if it means our kids are potentially drinking water that would damage their health,'" Obama said.
"There's a way of doing that and making sure the health and safety of the people of Nebraska are protected," he said.
