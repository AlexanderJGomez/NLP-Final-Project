Khan said he boarded a New York-bound plane in Toronto on Friday when two U.S. immigration officials asked him to step outside.
Khan missed his flight, but he eventually made it to New York, and later Seattle, for fund-raisers for his political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf.
A State Department official acknowledged that Khan was "briefly delayed" before boarding the next flight to the United States.
American officials say the drone strikes are an effective strategy against militant groups and insist civilian casualties are rare.
Khan says people he has spoken to in the tribal region say most of the people killed are innocent civilians.
