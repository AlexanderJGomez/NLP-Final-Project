CNN travelled to the town of Glashütte in Saxony, known as the birthplace of the German watchmaking tradition.
Here, watchmakers such as A. Lange & Söhne and Nomos Glashütte among others have thrived since the fall of the Wall and have since exported their high-end watches to the rest of the world.
The love for details striving for perfection.
I think that combination is what drives people and what makes them our customers," said Wilhelm Schmid, CEO of A. Lange & Söhne.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall, much of the watch industry was able to get back on its feet, explained Schmid.
Fortunately for those companies, Glashütte has revived as Germany's capital of watchmaking once again, employing more people than it ever has.
Watchmaker Nomos Glashütte is another example of the area's growth in the past 25 years.
