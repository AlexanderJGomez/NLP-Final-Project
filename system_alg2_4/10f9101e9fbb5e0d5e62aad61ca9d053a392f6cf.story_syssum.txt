(Wired) -- It's almost impossible for a photographer to find fresh visual perspectives these days.
So it's kind of this hidden airspace to the human eye, and it just immediately struck me as a really powerful visual."
The project started in 2009 when Seckler visited Botswana for another assignment and had some downtime.
Seckler was soon introduced to a pilot, who took him on his first ultra-light flight over the salt flats.
Seckler took thousands of photographs of the landscape itself, but found that even with strong compositions, the pure landscapes could become harder to make sense of.
Part of what makes the photos in Botswana work is that they straddle a line somewhere in between.
His personal projects tend to be thoroughly designed, humorous and forethought visions that require careful planning.
Seckler says he's been flattered by the response to the series, and credits its positive reception in part to a dearth of public exposure to aerial photography as art.
"There's not a lot of manipulation; it's as you would've seen them if you were in the seat next to me," he says.
