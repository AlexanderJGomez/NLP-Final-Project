LONDON, England (CNN) -- DNA testing to try to identify hundreds of bodies buried in a mass grave during World War I will start this week, the British and Australian ministries of defense announced Monday.
The DNA testing program will be the largest undertaking to identify individuals killed in combat ever commissioned, the ministry said.
So many soldiers died on the night of July 19, 1916, that many were never found, identified, or given a proper burial.
By morning, about 2,300 British and Australian soldiers were dead.
"It's the largest military find since the end of the Second World War," said a spokesman for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.
The resulting graveyard will be the first new one consecrated by the commission for almost 50 years, Francis told CNN by phone.
The bodies of more than 165,000 Commonwealth soldiers killed on the Western Front during the First World War are still missing, the commission says.
