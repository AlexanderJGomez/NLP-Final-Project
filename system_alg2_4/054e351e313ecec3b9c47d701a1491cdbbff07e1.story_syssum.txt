In an interview with Paris Match, a portion of which was published online Wednesday, al-Assad said his government has "noticed no change" in ISIS since the air campaign began more than two months ago.
Yet al-Assad said in his Paris Match interview, which took place on November 28 in Damascus and will be published in full Thursday, that the U.S.-led military campaign has limited use because "you can't end terrorism with aerial strikes.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, however, offered a very different view of the anti-ISIS fight Wednesday.
U.S. Central Command said that between Monday and Wednesday of this week, there were 14 coalition airstrikes in Syria -- all of them near Kobani, the city near the Turkish border that in recent weeks has become a key battleground in the ongoing fight -- in addition to 11 such strikes inside Iraq.
Yet the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the toll is much higher, claiming Tuesday that it's more than 200,000 people -- among them about 63,000 civilians, 45,000 Syrian troops and more than 50,000 rebel fighters.
"Regardless (of) what happens, we as Syrians will never allow our country to become a toy in Western hands," he said.
