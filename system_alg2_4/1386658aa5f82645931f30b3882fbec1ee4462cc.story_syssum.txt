Last Monday, Vice Premier Li delivered the keynote speech at the Boao Forum, a meeting of business and political leaders held yearly in southern Hainan province.
As the current executive vice premier, Li already oversees important portfolios, such macro economic planning, health care, energy and housing.
When he visited Hong Kong University last year, he delivered part of his speech in English -- a gesture that prompted debate in the mainland.
Others praised him for "open-mindedness" and for breaking away from the stoic style of Chinese leaders.
The son of a minor county official in Anhui, a poor province where Hu was also born, Li was a teenager when the decade-long Cultural Revolution interrupted his schooling.
Inside and outside classrooms, students and faculty debated big topics like "Where to, China?"
"He was already a student leader at that time."
Li did not stand for elections -- he happened to have an off-campus internship -- but as chairman of the student federation he spent time with politically active students like Wang Juntao, who campaigned but failed to get a seat.
Li rose through the ranks of CYL while completing a master's degree in law and then an economics doctorate under Li Yining, the guru of market reforms in China.
Wang has been in exile in the United States since 1994 and is now co-chair of the China Democratic Party, which advocates radical change in China.
Li also survived three major fire accidents in Henan.
As China's executive vice premier, Li remains a stalwart supporter of Hu's "seek a harmonious society" dictum.
Like his mentor Hu, Li has risen to his high position more by avoiding big mistakes than through bold ideas and major accomplishments.
