Climate change is driven by emissions of a range of heat-trapping gases, especially the total emissions of carbon dioxide, which have been pumping out since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.
In 2012, carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. were 19.4 tons per person or about 750 pounds per person per week.
Global annual carbon dioxide emissions continue to grow rapidly, with emissions in 2012 more than 50% above 1990 levels.
It also recognizes that not all the damages can be avoided and that building resilience needs to be a part of the package.
The global energy system producing most of the carbon dioxide emissions is massive, and includes thousands of power plants and more than a billion vehicles.
As things stand now, these realities commit us to continuing emissions into the future.
Why is U.S. leadership so important?
It will involve a wide range of technologies that emit little or no carbon dioxide, with greatly increased energy efficiency in vehicles, buildings, and equipment.
Today is the day to start.
