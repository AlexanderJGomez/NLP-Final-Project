(CNN) -- The suspect in the killing of Yale pharmacology graduate student Annie Le appeared in court in New Haven, Connecticut, Tuesday, but did not enter a plea, his attorney told CNN.
The body of Le, 24, was found inside a wall of a Yale lab building on September 12 -- the day she was to be married.
He lived with his girlfriend, who also is a Yale lab technician, according to New Haven police.
Yale has announced a memorial service for Le on October 12.
"You were born in my loving embrace," said Le's mother, Vivian Van Le, reading a poem she'd written in Vietnamese to those gathered for the funeral at Holy Trinity Catholic Church in El Dorado Hills.
All the dreams and hopes of your future gone with you to your resting place," Vivian Van Le said, according to her son.
