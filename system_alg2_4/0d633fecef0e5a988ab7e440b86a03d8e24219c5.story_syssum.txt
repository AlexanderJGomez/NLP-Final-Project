(CNN) -- For Dr. Lisa Newman, a 16-hour trip over two days from Michigan to Ghana in Africa is just part of the journey in uncovering clues about a rare form of breast cancer.
Triple negative breast cancer represents approximately 15 percent of breast cancer cases in the United States.
Newman, who is also the director of the Breast Care Center for the University of Michigan, recalls her early days during the '90's as a general surgeon in Brooklyn, New York.
The most successful treatments for breast cancer are drugs that specifically target these markers.
Sixty percent of Ghanaian women who have breast cancer have triple negative breast cancer, according to Newman.
Newman is convinced there's a profound link between Ghanaian women and African-American women afflicted with TNBC.
"We bring medical students and trainees with us to Ghana and they get to see what the health care system is like in a medically underserved part of the world," she says.
"And our colleagues from Ghana have opportunities to visit with us at the University of Michigan, and to learn more about westernized practices in terms of multidisciplinary care of breast cancer patients.
Dr. Newman has her own scare with breast cancer Â»
She runs DNA comparisons to the samples gathered in Ghana and one day hopes to correlate African ancestry with the risk of being diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer in African-Americans.
