"I can't tell you how many wonderful Syrians I have met here who've devoted their money and time to see a democratic, free Syria," said Mohammed, whose last name is being withheld by CNN to protect his brother and parents in Syria.

When one of the students asked how he reacts to the latest videos coming out of Syria, Hallak said he doesn't watch anymore.

He said they interrogated him and tortured him from day one.
Mohammad said he would not tell his brother to stop protesting.
