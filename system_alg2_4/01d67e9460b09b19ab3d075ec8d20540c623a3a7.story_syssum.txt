(CNN) -- In 2009, du Pont heir Robert H. Richards IV, 47, was convicted of raping his 3-year-old daughter and served no jail time because, a judge said, he would "not fare well" in prison.
And Richards is wealthy and connected -- he's the heir to not one, but two fortunes provided to him by his predecessors.
His lawyers pushed until Delaware prosecutors offered a deal allowing him the fourth-degree rape plea -- normally reserved for statutory rape cases -- and Richards admitted the assault.

And if the rapist doesn't "fare well" in prison, how is he a good fit for society?

But Tracy Richards has not given up.
The suit also alleges that Richards then told the girl "to keep what he had done to her a secret."
The girl eventually told her grandmother, who informed Tracy Richards.
I've got my fingers crossed that a civil jury will award jaw-dropping damages in this case and strip Richards of the trust fund and the wealthy status that allowed him to avoid jail -- where he really belongs.
