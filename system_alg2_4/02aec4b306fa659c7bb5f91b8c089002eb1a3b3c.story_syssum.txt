Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN)At least 15 people, including two members of Parliament and a deputy mayor, were killed Friday when militants attacked a hotel frequented by government officials in the heart of Somalia's capital, police said.
Then came a second blast -- a suicide bombing carried out by a woman near a mosque inside the hotel -- as other attackers shot their way in, Abdi said.
They include Parliament members Hajji Gafe and Ali Omar, as well as Mohamed Aden Guled, Mogadishu's deputy mayor, Abdi said.
Since emerging in the mid-2000s, Al-Shabaab has been intent on taking control of Somalia, one of the world's poorest countries, with a gross domestic product per person that ranks 226th out of 228 countries.
Four days later, the siege ended with as many as 67 dead and parts of the mall destroyed.
But Al-Shabaab has continued its campaign of violence in attacks such as a suicide blast last month on a Somali army convoy in Mogadishu, the bombing of a bus carrying Kenyan teachers in Galkayo, Somalia, and an attack on an African Union military base.
