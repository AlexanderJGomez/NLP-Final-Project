I sit safely now in my new home in Qatar, and those who shared my Libyan experiences -- and who knew Chris -- are now spread out around the world.
Because I knew and worked with Chris, I understand firsthand that the world has lost a true hero, and we seem to have precious few of those.
I was there as the new director of the fledgling American School of Tripoli and Chris had just been appointed U.S. Deputy Chief of Mission.
Because no ambassador had yet been named, as deputy chief, Chris served as acting ambassador until the arrival of Ambassador Gene Cretz in January 2009.
Chris built a team of embassy personnel, negotiated with a quixotic Libyan government, helped the returning U.S. companies and served as chairman of the Board of Trustees of the American School.
He traveled across the sparsely populated country savoring the rich archaeological sites, and broke bread with Berbers in their cave homes.
Of course I feel anger at those horribly misguided people who are responsible for this tragedy, but I am also trying to rise above it, like Chris would.
We live in a world where frustration and anger override the sanctity of life.
As I continue to watch the Libyans, who have only known oppression, try to dig out of the void left behind in the wake of Moammar Gadhafi's fall, I will always remember Chris and the legacy he has left them.
My hope is hope that Libya will flourish for its people and that we, each in our own way, will make him proud.
