Duncan, Oklahoma (CNN) -- Justin Boyles lay in bed, exhausted and depressed.
Her mom had tried to explain why Justin was so sad, but Autumn didn't really understand diabetes or its dangerous implications.
"Do you pinky promise?"
Shanon and Justin Boyles were high school sweethearts.
"As long as I can remember, I've been overweight," Justin says.
"I was really kind of in my own little hole, and I didn't want to get out or do anything," he says.
He was down on himself real bad."
Since his diagnosis with type 2 diabetes in March -- and his pinky promise to Autumn -- Justin has lost more than 65 pounds.
Shanon joins in; she's lost 20 pounds in less than six months on the new diet.
"I no longer lay in bed thinking that my weight is just too much to overcome," Justin says.
I don't care what weight he's at," Shanon says.
On his website Justin has included a section where he asks readers to make their own promises -- to themselves or to their family -- to get healthy.
Justin still has a long way to go in his weight loss journey.
