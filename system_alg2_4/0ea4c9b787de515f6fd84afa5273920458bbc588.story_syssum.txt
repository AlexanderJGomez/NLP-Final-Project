Burning coal contributes half of the excess carbon dioxide (CO2) polluting the earth's atmosphere, a statistic not lost on the hundreds of climate change protesters camping in a grassy field near Kingsnorth power station in Kent, England this week.
It's one of four power stations on a UK government shortlist to trial the country's first commercial-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology.
More research would have to be done on other alternatives including deep saline aquifers and deep coal seams.
That's actually very common worldwide."
Professor Haszeldine estimates that if a new power plant costs $1.5 billion to build, it'll cost an extra $700,000 to fit the capture equipment on the first experimental plants.
Would you pay more for 'greener' power?
Aside from government subsidies and investment by companies and private parties, an obvious way to fund the change is through cap and trading schemes.
"The problem is that the price of maybe €35 ($54) or €40 ($62) per ton of carbon dioxide will not be enough to fund the gap in the extra estimated cost of these new power plants," explains Professor Haszeldine.
In principle that's possible because the government will receive the income from dirty power plants who will have to buy their emissions.
Environmentalists are wary.
Professor Haszeldine says the environmental cost of not doing it could be catastrophic.
"The risk of not doing it is that the world continues to put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels whether it's coal or gas or oil.
