(CNN) -- A web editor in Thailand has been convicted of hosting posts on a website critical of the country's revered monarchy.
Chiranuch had faced 10 charges under the 2007 Computer Crime Act -- which includes lese-majeste offenses -- for statements posted by others on Prachatai between April and November 2008.
According to The Campaign Committee for the Amendment of Section 112 of the Criminal Code, the petition aims to sponsor a bill to prevent abuse of the current law.
Earlier this month, a 61-year-old man serving a 20-year sentence for lese-majeste and computer offenses died in a prison hospital in Bangkok.
At the city's criminal court, they tied black ribbons on fences to protest against his jail term.
