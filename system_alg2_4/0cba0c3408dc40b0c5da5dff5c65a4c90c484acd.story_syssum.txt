Barcelona, Spain (CNN) -- Atletico Madrid won the Spanish league title in extraordinary circumstances Saturday courtesy of a draw at Barcelona that denied the Catalan club the crown.
Now Atleti will turn their attentions to the unlikeliest of doubles as they face city rivals Real Madrid in a mouthwatering Champions League final in Libson next Saturday.
All the while Barca have struggled on the pitch after a superb start to the season, exiting the Champions League at the hands of Atletico and losing the Spanish Cup final to Real Madrid in April, in the meantime letting the title slip out of their grasp when it was theirs to lose after a 4-3 win at Real in March.
It was the league no-one could win as Barca, Real and Atleti all threw away points in the final few weeks of the season; the underdogs from Madrid blowing their first chance to win the title outright when they were held 1-1 at home by Malaga last weekend while Barca were drawing 0-0 in Elche.
When Alexis seized on a Lionel Messi chest pass in the Atleti box after 33 minutes and rifled a ferocious right-foot shot into the roof of the net from an audacious angle, suddenly Barca were the ones in the driving seat.
At the start of the second half they came out like a train, and after David Villa -- who won the title with Barca last year -- struck the base of the post, Godin rose majestically to score the goal his career and this most remarkable of seasons will be remembered for.
In the face of such heartbreak, the reaction from the Barca fans was magical -- they stood to a man to applaud the team that had just deposed them as Spanish champions and even sang "Atleti, Atleti" as the players rose to their feet to acknowledge what was happening around them.
