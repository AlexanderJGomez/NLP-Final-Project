Aaron Sofer was reported missing on Friday by a friend who he was hiking with in the Jerusalem Forest, Israeli Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told CNN.
The friend "lost contact" with Sofer while walking with him and reported the disappearance to the police, Rosenfeld said.
Sofer's parents arrived in Israel on Monday.
"His mind is clear, no problems at all," Isseeman said to CNN affiliate WCBS reported.
"There are concerns, as we all know, about the possibility of abduction," Smith said, according to CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey.
