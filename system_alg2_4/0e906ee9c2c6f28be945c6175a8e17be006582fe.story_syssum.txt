But Hill clawed his way back into the title hunt, helped by Schumacher's two-race ban for ignoring a black flag at the British Grand Prix.
Hill would have become world champion if he could have kept going but suspension damage ended his race and his title challenge.
Three years on from Adelaide, those who had given Schumacher the benefit of the doubt were left to reassess their opinions of the German.
Schumacher slid off into the gravel and retirement while Villeneuve, his car damaged from the collision, hobbled on to finish third and take the title by three points.
Going to the season-closer in Japan, Schumacher had to make up four points on Hakkinen, who had edged the previous race at the Nurgburgring.
It had been a remarkable debut season for McLaren's Hamilton, with him often outpacing double world champion team-mate Alonso.
F1's first three-way title decider since 1986 saw Hamilton start the last race in Brazil with a four-point advantage over Alonso and seven over Raikkonen.
Out front, Massa slowed to allow Raikkonen past for the win he needed to become champion by one point from seventh-placed Hamilton and Alonso, who trailed home a distant third.
