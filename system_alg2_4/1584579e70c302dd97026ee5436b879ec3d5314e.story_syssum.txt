When the 32-year-old New York Knicks lifer first drummed up the plan to follow his beloved NBA team at every stop -- including London -- for an entire season, he had no idea it would be a historic one.
"This is the worst basketball that I've seen this season," says Doyle, while exiting the O2 Arena after the Knicks were blown out by the Milwaukee Bucks for their 16th loss in a row.
During the off season, the Knicks hired Phil Jackson to run its front office -- unchartered territory for the legendary former coach.
For Doyle, however, supporting the Knicks is practically out of his hands.
"I ended up choosing the team most like the Knicks," Doyle explains.
"It's a tough season, so we really appreciate his effort of trying to see all of our games," says Pablo Prigioni, the Knicks Argentinian point guard and Doyle's favorite current player.
"Because of course we never expected this kind of season; but by now we are in the middle of deep changes, so I think in the future the team will be much better."
"But a lot of people in my position will travel the world.
A great fan of Nick Hornsby's "Fever Pitch," he intends to write a memoir about the Knicks' season in the same vein, minus the trophy ending.
he says.
"At a certain point, it's like watching a small animal get tortured and there's no reason to continue to subject myself to that kind of pain," he says.
"That's a lot more hardcore than I am," says Ziad Al-Essa, a 35-year-old Milwaukee Bucks faithful, who flew in from Kuwait and spent $750 on a floor seat to see the London game.
Nevertheless, Doyle admits that he'll be relieved once the season is over, and doubts he'll renew his season ticket even though he thinks the Knicks can become a playoff team next season.
"I miss watching it on TV," he says.
