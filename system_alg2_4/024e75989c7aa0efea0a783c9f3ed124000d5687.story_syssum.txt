London (CNN) -- Internet giants signed up Tuesday to a "zero tolerance" approach to images of child sexual abuse as the British government announced a new, tougher strategy to find and block illegal content.
While there are an estimated 1 million unique images of child abuse online, only 40,000 reports are made to the Internet Watch Foundation each year, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said.
"This will mean more images of child sexual abuse will be tracked down and acted on," said Culture Secretary Maria Miller.
In addition, Internet providers have agreed to introduce by the end of the month special pages to tell users when they try to access a page that has been blocked by the Internet Watch Foundation.
The four main UK Internet service providers will also beef up the parental control options they offer, so that parents can easily restrict Internet access on all devices in their home by the end of the year.
Google said Tuesday that it will spend $5 million on an effort to wipe pictures of child sexual abuse from the Web and another $2 million to research more effective ways to find, report and eradicate the images.
