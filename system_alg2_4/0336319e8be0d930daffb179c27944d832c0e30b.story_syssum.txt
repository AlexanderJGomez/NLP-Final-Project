But, as Mark Woodman, the president of the Color Marketing Group points out, a color as bold as orange is never gone for good.
"The beauty of orange is its energetic appeal in almost all of its values," Woodman said.
But even as colors come and go in popular use (orange is already beginning to cycle down in popularity, with cooler blues taking the forefront in design and color news), orange always comes to mind as the weather cools down.
"In the end, orange has been embraced by so many that we won't want to see it go," Woodman said.

I fell in love with the color, too, and wanted it somewhere else in our home.
While it's not for everyone, I have to say that I love it."
