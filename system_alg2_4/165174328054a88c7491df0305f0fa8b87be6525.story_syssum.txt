Washington (CNN) -- Before President Obama says a word during his Tuesday Oval Office address, the backdrop will make a statement for him: that he is the decider.
The Oval Office symbolizes power, command, and authority, Dallek said.
For example, Obama's speech in front of the joint session of Congress a year ago conveyed his desire to get Congress to act on health care reform.
"A joint session of Congress has a different function," Dallek said.
An Oval Office address is different.
Because of the singular focus on the subject matter during Obama's Tuesday evening address, Obama will have to navigate the tricky road of marking the end of a war he did not support and honoring the lives of all the Americans killed in the war, Dallek said.
Since former President Jimmy Carter, each president has delivered his farewell address from that room, using the office of the presidency to say goodbye to the American public.
Franklin Roosevelt's fireside addresses -- although there were no televisions at the time, these radio talks were effective in boosting the country's confidence.
