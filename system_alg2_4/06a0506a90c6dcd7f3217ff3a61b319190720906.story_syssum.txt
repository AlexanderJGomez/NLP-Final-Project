Situated right in the middle of this pop culture hoard of zombies is Greg Nicotero, a makeup effects guru.
Nicotero, who still runs KNB, has now become involved in the theme park business by acting as a consultant for Universal Studios Orlando's "Walking Dead" attraction at their Halloween Horror Nights event.
Greg Nicotero: I appreciate you saying that because every season when I watch the show, I'm constantly looking at what I feel people responded to and what people like, and what I thought was successful or could be refined.
Every year we're able to do that and it's exciting.
So the teeth don't clip onto the actor's teeth but the teeth attach inside the prosthetic, so you don't have to put custom dentures into every single performer.
I am really proud of Season Four and where the show is going.
I don't know if "pressure" is the right word, but we feel an obligation to continue to make the show great.
What Universal Orlando has been able to do is put fans directly in the middle of the experience.
I provided them with photos of a lot of sculptures we did at KNB EFX.
NIcotero: I am a movie fan.
I have been that guy who has been to those locations because it connects me to the material I love so much.
They're going to connect themselves to the experience, and they now know what it's like to be on the set of "The Walking Dead."
"Dawn of the Dead" and "Jaws" teeter back-and-forth as the number one movie that I loved, and which influenced me.
... Robert Kirkman's comic book is really a love letter to George Romero.
Nicotero: I think about things differently because I did come up in the ranks of the makeup effects world.
We did a cameo of the airport zombie from "Dawn of the Dead" with the plaid shirt in Episode 15 last year.
The thing I love the most is I've been doing this 30 years, and every day I come to work and still learn more.
