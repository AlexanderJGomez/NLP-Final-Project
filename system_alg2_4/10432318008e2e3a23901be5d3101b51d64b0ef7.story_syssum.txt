The Swiss Formula One team has joined forces with English football club Chelsea in an innovative marketing ploy aimed at attracting a global audience -- and boost sponsorship.
"The Sauber F1 team and Chelsea FC are dealing with many of the same sporting and commercial topics and we want to strengthen each other in these areas.
"In a year when Chelsea celebrates 20 seasons as a Premier League team, Sauber does so as a Formula One team.
"This partnership will benefit us both greatly, with the potential to create unique commercial opportunities," Gourlay said.
