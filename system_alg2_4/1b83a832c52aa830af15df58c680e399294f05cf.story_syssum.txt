"Levinson traveled to Kish Island, Iran, on March 8, 2007, working on behalf of several large corporations, and his whereabouts, well-being and the circumstances surrounding his disappearance have been unknown since that time," it said in a statement.
It is time for him to come home," Kerry said.
Iran's government repeatedly has said it is not holding Levinson and does not know his whereabouts.
That prompted his family to speak out, saying they kept it quiet for years that Levinson was working for the CIA, because the U.S. government had warned them that revealing it would put him in more jeopardy.
Whoever his captors are, in 2010 they sent a "proof of life" videotape and photographs of Levinson to his family.
