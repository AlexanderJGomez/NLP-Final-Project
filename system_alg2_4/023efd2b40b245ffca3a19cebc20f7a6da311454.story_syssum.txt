Washington (CNN) -- A Washington lawyer has filed a lawsuit in federal court, claiming he is the father of basketball star LeBron James.
Stovell said his only request was that the child, if a boy, play basketball.
He said his memory of the encounter resurfaced more than 20 years later, "after being asked whether I had a son, and I then systematically explored all of my past for that possibility."
Stovell said he filed the suit two weeks ago because a statute of limitations was about to expire.
The lawsuit states Gloria James was 16 at the time of the alleged encounter, but Stovell said she told him she was in her early 20s.
Public records show Stovell is a former government attorney with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
He filed a lawsuit in 2002 against the agency, alleging racial discrimination.
