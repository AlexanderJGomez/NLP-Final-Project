(CNN) -- Portugal's Sergio Paulinho won stage 10 to hand Lance Armstrong's RadioShack team their first victory in the Tour de France.
Andy Schleck's overall lead was never threatened during the 179km stage from Chambery to Gap, while the home crowd could not celebrate a local winner in sweltering temperatures on Bastille Day.
Paulinho, who won a silver medal at the 2004 Olympics in the road race, was part of a six-man break and only a determined sprint prevented Kiryienka picking up Belarus' first ever Tour win.
Overall leader Schleck was pleased with a comfortable day in the saddle: "It was quite an easy day even if it was fast at the beginning.
I had a little bit of time to enjoy my first day in the yellow jersey.
