(CNN) -- I remember fragments of the story of SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau's killing in 2010 -- something about a ponytail, something about her slipping and falling, something about how this almost never ever happens because in these parks, the animals are happy and the trainers are safe.
I set out to understand this incident, not as an animal activist -- because I'm not one -- but as a mother who had just taken her kids to SeaWorld, and of course as a documentary filmmaker who unfortunately can't let sleeping dogs lie.
I spoke to Tim Zimmermann who wrote a phenomenal article for Outside magazine about killer whales and asked him to come aboard as an associate producer.
I knew immediately that I wanted SeaWorld to have a voice in the film.
I can't say this was an easy film to make.
SeaWorld is a $2 billion a year entity, and they'll do anything to protect their greatest asset: Shamu.
Two years after I wrote the treatment in 2010 we finished "Blackfish."
I know that killer whales are not suitable for captivity.
My hope is that we take the "Blackfish" momentum and use it to help evolve us out of animals for entertainment.
I always say no.
I don't know if it will change the way you feel about animals in entertainment parks.
And I trust that once audiences are armed with the truth, they will make the best decisions by themselves and their families.
