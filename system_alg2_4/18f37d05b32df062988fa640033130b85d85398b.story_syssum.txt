Washington (CNN) -- Ten years after its formation, the Transportation Security Administration on Wednesday got the type of birthday card no one wants to receive -- a blistering report from Republican lawmakers who said the agency is "bloated" and "inefficient" and has done little, if anything, to improve aviation security.
"Americans have spent nearly $60 billion funding TSA and they are no safer today than they were before 9/11," Broun said.
"We must focus on identifying terrorists and stopping them instead of patting down grandma and children.
Mica and Braun released the GOP report at a news conference held in the main concourse of Reagan-Washington National Airport.
One day earlier, TSA Administrator John Pistole stood in the same location to discuss holiday travel preparations, touting advancements in screening technology and saying passengers are happy with changes that have reduced the number of pat downs of children.
The TSA has become "lost" in the Homeland Security bureaucracy, Mica said.
In other TSA news, a travel industry group Wednesday said the agency's screening procedures remain "inefficient and frustrating" for travelers.
According to the survey, "four of the top five air traveler frustrations relate to the checkpoint process," including the top frustration: "People who bring too many carry-on bags through the security checkpoint."
The TSA said it was pleased to see the vast majority of travelers polled believe the agency is moving in the right direction, and said checkpoint screening has gotten speedier, taking less than 20 minutes for more than 99 percent of passengers last year.
