(CNN) -- The death of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who was killed Thursday in his hometown of Sirte, Libya, is "an important step" for Libya, but don't expect the fighting to end right away, said CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman.
And for him to end up basically in the same sort of spider hole that Saddam Hussein did seems a bit odd, a bit out of character.
It was expected that Gadhafi could be able to hold out a bit longer than this.
I was in parts of Libya where I spoke to lots of people who were opposed to the new rulers of Libya, but not necessarily great supporters of Moammar Gadhafi.
There is a worry that this new regime in Libya will be very slow, if (they) succeed at all, in moving to democracy.
Yes, it's an important step along the way, but the killing of Moammar Gadhafi certainly doesn't mean that it's going to be smooth sailing.
Let's not forget even in Iraq -- and there are huge differences -- the first few months after the fall of Saddam Hussein were relatively quiet.
There's been a lot of talk about tribal differences (in Libya) We haven't really seen that play out ... but I would not in any sense bet my bottom dollar that Libya will be smooth sailing now that Gadhafi is dead.
