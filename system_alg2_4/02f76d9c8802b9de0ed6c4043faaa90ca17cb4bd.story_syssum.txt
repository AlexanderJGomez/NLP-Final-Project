(CNN) -- Renewable energy is generating a lot of political heat.
It is also becoming a more established part of the world's overall energy supply.
Yet it is still a relatively small business compared to the overall energy business, and one that still faces big challenges in getting to scale on a global basis.
But the early hopes soon crashed on the harsh reality of lower energy prices and the fact that the technologies were still immature and not yet ready for primetime.
The European Union's energy policy is now predicated on using renewables to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 80% by 2050.
In order to meet its rapidly growing needs for energy, China is pursuing all options -- oil and coal and natural gas and nuclear power, as well as renewables.
Over the last decade, growing support by governments for renewable energy has been critical to its development.
Moreover, an increasing number of states now require that a certain percentage of electricity must be renewable -- the so-called "renewable portfolio standards."
As the renewable share of electric power goes up, this "intermittency" will be a bigger concern.
One solution is more use of natural gas as renewables' "partner" -- to generate electricity at those times when the sun and wind are off duty.
Renewables are carbon free.
The costs of solar energy continue to come down, and many of the new approaches under development and in the lab are aimed at further cost reductions.
To achieve big impact, however, renewables still need to establish that they are competitive at large scale.
Wind and solar are small, but they are growing.
As costs go down, more solar will come into use around the world.
In other words, wind and solar have much ground to cover, and it will take time.
Renewable will be part of a growing global business that will be measured in hundreds of billions of dollars.
That will be determined by a mix of government policy, technological advance, the world's energy needs -- and by sheer economics.
