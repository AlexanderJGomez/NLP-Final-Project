Johnson, D-South Dakota, said Thursday he supports strong sanctions against Iran and has legislation adding new sanctions ready to move should Iran fail to meet its obligations under the deal, which is meant to prevent it from acquiring a nuclear weapon.
That deal, if it comes together, would include a new round of sanctions to begin in six months and would bar the enrichment of uranium.
"We see today that that the Iranians are launching a rocket next week, and though this was supposedly made as their space program, it's well known that this is just a cover for military ballistic weapons program," Menendez said at Thursday's hearing.
"
In his statement Thursday, Johnson agreed to do just that, and suggested that other lawmakers should follow suit.
Fuel for nuclear power requires 5% enrichment, but Iran has stockpiles of uranium enriched to 20%.
On Thursday, amid the debate about imposing new sanctions, the administration listed a dozen companies and individuals for helping Iran evade existing sanctions and for providing support for its nuclear program.
The designations show the administration's resolve to enforce sanctions during the six-month interim agreement with Iran, Undersecretary for Terrorism and FInancial Intelligence David Cohen said in a statement.
"We haven't let up; we won't let up," the official said.
