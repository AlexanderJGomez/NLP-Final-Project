"Over the last several weeks, decade-old, discredited allegations against Mr. Cosby have resurfaced.
We don't know what Bill Cosby did or did not do, but these allegations should not be easily dismissed.
Bowman has no financial incentive to speak out; she never asked for or received money from Cosby, and the statue of limitations in her case has long passed.
Some victims can't admit for years -- even to ourselves -- that we were raped.
It is harrowing to speak out about rape and other acts of abuse perpetuated by someone you know.
This is not like describing how you lost your wallet or broke your leg skiing.
It is excruciating to hear about rape and assault.
So it's not surprising that these allegations about Cosby have been discredited before.
Rape and relationship violence experts know that one of the most important factors in recovering from assault is that the first person you tell believes you.
Let's hope that the media, corporate leaders and our criminal justice system begin to offer compassion and dignity to women (and men) coming forward with allegations of violence and sexual assault.
