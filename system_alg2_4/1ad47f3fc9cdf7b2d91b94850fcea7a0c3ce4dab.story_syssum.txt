"If we want things to stay as they are," he says, "things will have to change."
The only question was in what configuration the two leaders would return.
Yet the reality is that Putin's return to the Kremlin will not, in itself, change much.
Unless Western leaders seek to punish Putin for his return, there is no reason to think it will undermine the "reset" of recent years.
Both want to make Russia a strong, modern country and understand the need for an efficient economy linked into global markets and capital flows.
To maintain their popularity, the two leaders have employed a political division of labor.
Although the economy shrank by 8% in 2009, government spending grew from 34 to 41% of GDP.
Although Putin's -- and Medvedev's -- approval ratings have fallen in the last two years, the decline has been relatively slow.
Barring a sudden collapse, this should be enough to get Putin comfortably through next March's election, even without the predictable electoral irregularities.
As prime minister, Medvedev will be plunged into the operational details of managing the economy at an unusually tricky moment.
Although Russia achieved growth of 4% last year, it is not clear how long it can continue at this rate without major reforms to restore battered investor confidence.
Yet there is also the chance that he will survive for long enough to see reforms bear fruit -- and claim a share of the credit.
How effective he proves in this new role -- and how much leeway Putin allows him -- remain to be seen.
