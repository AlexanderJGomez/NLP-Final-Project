It's a common malady these days.
Like any machine, a well-maintained car or computer will surprise you, no matter its age.
In our modern consumer culture, it's not surprising that many people are under the impression that newer always means better.
Check for driver and version updates either at your computer manufacturer's Web site or through the list of software you use frequently; see if new drivers or versions are available.
For this reason, I recommend moving as many of your activities to the Web as possible.
At the risk of seeming Google-centric, I have to point out that it's even possible to manage basic documents and spreadsheets online -- once proprietary to bloated Microsoft Office products -- for free with Google Docs.
If you're still using Internet Explorer, stop!
Another option takes us back to the Web -- you can often get an online backup plan that will remove your valuable data not only from that main hard drive, but also from your computer's immediate vicinity.
Comparably minor hardware upgrades like more RAM or better video cards will likely make a major difference in your old system's performance.
Your old computer, treated with care and respect, can still make that pan-global road trip on the Information Superhighway.
