(CNN) -- Most of us don't know much about Kim Jong Il, the reclusive North Korean leader who died Saturday.
Rocha said Monday he has about 375 unposted photos of Kim Jong Il in his archives and is leaning toward keeping the blog going.
He said he got the idea for the blog last year after seeing a gallery of similar Kim Jong Il photos on the Boston Globe's website.
With rule of North Korea expected to pass to Kim's son, Kim Jong Un, a copycat blog has already appeared showing similar images of the younger Kim.
Rocha doesn't think the new blog's subject carries the same ironic weight, though.
In the 14 months since he launched the blog, Rocha has posted hundreds of images of North Korea's dictator, flanked by an ever-present entourage and peering at everything from bubble gum to sausage.
