London, England (CNN) -- Britain's Prince William and fiancee Kate Middleton made their first official engagement as a couple Thursday, launching a lifeboat in Wales.
Despite the modest nature of the event, hundreds of people turned out to watch the royal couple conduct their first official duty together.
"It's a very low-key event, launching a lifeboat on the island where they both live...it's a very good debut event for them," said Saunders.
The reason for such a low-key ceremony, says Saunders, is to prepare Middleton for life as a royal.
After naming the new Atlantic 85 lifeboat, Prince William and Middleton met members of the charity's lifeboat crew along with fundraising volunteers and were given a demonstration of the vessel's capabilities.
The couple currently reside in Anglesey while Prince William serves as an RAF search and rescue helicopter pilot.
