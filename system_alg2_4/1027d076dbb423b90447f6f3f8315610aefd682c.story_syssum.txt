And how can the Nigerian government and the rest of the world have allowed this to happen?
For this we should all feel shame: shame that we live in a world where the lives of young girls can be shattered with impunity by fanatical thugs.
My heart goes out to the grief-stricken loved ones of these missing girls on this painful anniversary.
But it can be done.
It must be done.
Our common humanity compels us to do our part, to right this shameful wrong.
