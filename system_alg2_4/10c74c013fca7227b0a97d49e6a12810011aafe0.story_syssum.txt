Ryan Taylor, right, and client Shawn Stockman of Boyz II Men at Taylor's downtown Los Angeles office.
His story in the apparel business began with the word "wardrobe" itself.
" He decided to remove the word "war" and create a brand called DROBE that would offer professionals and smaller mom-and-pop boutiques his personalized custom style.
"  Watch Taylor discuss how his business started Â»
"Nine times out of 10 we visit clients in their home or offices, we take their measurements right there inside their office, have them select the fabric they prefer, take their measurements right then and there, and [in] a couple weeks have a tailor-made garment to wear," he said.
Taylor told CNN's Ted Rowlands that one of his first clients was the late comedian Bernie Mac.
But his reputation did not change his business style.
The vast majority of men and women who make up Taylor's clientele earn a living on Main Street, like Brian Asciak, the sales manager of a Ford dealership in Long Beach, California, who became Taylor's most recent customer as he sat in his office.
He recently opened a second DROBE office in Pasadena, California, and wants to add 200 clients before the end of the year.
