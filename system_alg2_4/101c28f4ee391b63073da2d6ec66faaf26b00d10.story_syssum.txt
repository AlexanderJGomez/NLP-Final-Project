I'm not mad at Tiger Woods, or Nike.
Back in 2009, when Woods took his public plunge into disgrace by cheating on his wife with a long list of silicone-enhanced beauties, we criticized him for being a fake.
But I never thought it was Tiger's job to teach my son how to be a responsible, loving husband or father.
He's being honest with the public.
And good for Nike for standing by him through what was in the end just a personal flaw.
Don't be mad at Tiger.
Be mad at the problems in your own personal life.
In those worlds you are only as good as your last big win.
Or, "One win will make my bosses happy and all will be forgotten?"
Just think of Super Bowl Champion Ray Lewis, who the NFL calls one of the best men to ever play the game.
Why?
Tiger got back up.
And I hope this time around he can relax, be himself and enjoy the game.
