It also has formed several children's homes in Haiti and India.
We had dewormed 1.7 million children at the time.
Most people know us for our worm initiative in Haiti, but we've dewormed in Nicaragua, Honduras, Bolivia, Guatemala.
Seeing these kids run around after being dewormed, it's an amazing thing.
Jackson: We now have seven children's homes: four in Haiti and three in India.
That would be awesome.
We have a rule: no more than 10 (children) in each home, because we want to keep them very family-style.
One in Haiti is for HIV-positive children.
Jackson: Some of these kids we've had for about eight years.
They have a chance at life and hopefully will become future leaders of Haiti or elsewhere.
We're not going to help Haiti -- or whatever country we're working in -- if we send the kids away.
We were in the middle of our national deworming program and treating every child -- all 3.2 million kids -- and we had distributed half of that.
Jackson: We were extremely fortunate.
Jackson: Rainn has been extremely beneficial on all fronts, helping bring awareness and raise money for the cause.
He's making the cause a little cooler now that he's a part of it.
He's put us in contact with some amazing people that have helped us.
Most people think that rainforest is being destroyed because people are going in and cutting trees.
It's said that two out of every 10 breaths we take come from the Amazon rainforest.
It's important to preserve that for our future.
