Of upmost concern is not a lengthy closure of the federal bureaucracy, but that Washington could default on its debt around October 17, unless the debt limit is raised by Congress.
In other words, the country's reputation as a responsible international power, both in terms of domestic and foreign policy, is being undermined.
Based on a sample of about 3,600 people in 18 countries, it concludes that the country is "in decline," partly because of "successive fiscal crises."
These findings on the U.S.'s reputation are echoed by the 2013 BBC Country Rating Survey, which interviewed about 26,000 people in 25 countries, and also the 2013 Pew Global Study based on a sample of about 37,600 in 39 countries.
This was demonstrated, for instance, during the 2008-9 financial crisis when Congress and the administration acted more swiftly and comprehensively than many other countries to counteract the worst economic turmoil since at least the 1930s.
This has been key in enabling the country to recover more quickly from recession than some other areas of the world.
At the core of the current troubles is not just growing polarization between Democrats and Republicans, but significant intra-party divisions too.
The perception, in many foreign capitals, is that growing partisanship is also infecting U.S. foreign policy.
Already this month, Obama has lost the opportunity to advance the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal as a result of the cancellation of his Asia trip.
Looking ahead this month, it remains most likely that a deal will be done before October 17 to raise the debt limit.
This would not just further undermine the U.S.'s reputation as a responsible international power, but potentially send it into freefall again.
