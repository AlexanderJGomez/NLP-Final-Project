(CNN) -- Coinciding with this season's flu outbreak is an upsurge of another illness that can be dangerous, even deadly, especially for infants: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
When RSV attacks the lungs, it is particularly dangerous for newborns and babies born prematurely.
"Just in general, when we look at cough and respiratory symptoms, there's a lot of overlap," said Dr. Susan Gerber, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
In Boston, a city hit hard by the flu, Massachusetts General Hospital has more than 175 cases of RSV on the record so far this season.
"I brought him in because he was wheezing and coughing," she says.
RSV spreads much like the flu -- exposure from others who are coughing or sneezing and by direct skin-to-skin contact.
Cooper Dearborn tested positive for RSV but responded quickly following a procedure to clear his lungs of congestion.
For babies at highest risk -- those born prematurely, with congenital heart or lung disease -- there is one medication to help ward it off: Doctors may administer a series of injections (Palivizumab) as a protective measure.
There currently is no vaccine for RSV.
