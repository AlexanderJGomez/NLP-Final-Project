"The Iranian government must understand that the world is watching," Obama said in a White House statement.
The statement came as Iranian security forces cracked down Saturday on demonstrators in Tehran in continuing protests against the outcome of Iran's June 12 election.
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the overwhelming victor in voting that opposition groups called rigged.
"The Iranian people will ultimately judge the actions of their own government," Obama said in the statement.
"It's not productive, given the history of U.S.-Iranian relations, to be seen as meddling, the U.S. president meddling in Iranian elections," Obama said this week.
The diplomats said they were watching to see whether Iranian security forces would continue the crackdown.
