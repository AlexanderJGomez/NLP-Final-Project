Investigators in the case have uncovered a series of text messages between Obermiller and her boyfriend, identified by police and by Obermiller's parents as 20-year-old Robert Young of Norwalk, that appear to be coordinating when she would be picked up from her grandparents' home in the early morning hours of June 7, Fulton said.
At 12:45 a.m. June 7, Young responded and told her to "leave now," Fulton said.
Young has told police the messages were a week old and were sent over Memorial Day weekend while the couple coordinated a swimming date, Fulton said.
Hope to see you soon.
Love, Abbi," according to Fulton.
"But as it went on, he was telling her, 'No I don't want you to be class treasurer; no, I don't want you to go to New York with your choir; no, I don't want you to see these friends and relatives," Obermiller said.
Fulton said Young has declined to take a polygraph test in the case.
