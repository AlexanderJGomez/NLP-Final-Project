FIFA extended its North American media rights agreements -- handing Fox the English language deal and NBCUniversal's Telemundo the Spanish language rights -- for an event in which the 2026 host nation has still to be determined.
That raises the question as to whether Fox, which already had agreements in place for the 2018 and 2022 editions following a $425 million deal signed in 2011, won the latest contract without any competition.
A move to winter would be bad news for Fox given it could clash with the NFL playoffs and potentially the 2022 Winter Olympics.
Some media commentators have suggested Fox was awarded the latest deal on the proviso that it will not make a complaint when the 2022 tournament is shifted to the Qatari winter.
"These events are some of the world's most important sports competitions, and it is our privilege to be entrusted with these rights in the United States," Fox said in a statement.
