So what could come next for Greece?
The vote of confidence in Papandreou's government is expected to go ahead as planned, despite discussions Thursday on the formation of an interim coalition or national unity government.
In another scenario, the leader of the main opposition New Democracy party said Thursday that his party could enter a coalition government with the PASOK party, as an interim stage leading to new elections.
Under Greek law, a vote cannot be held until at least 30 days after elections are called, meaning that the Greek people would go to the polls in early December at the soonest.
The conservatives have said Greece needs to bargain harder with Europe on any deal.
Papandreou told his Cabinet Thursday he was backing off from a referendum vote because the opposition New Democracy party had agreed to the need to pass austerity measures required by the bailout.
The recent crisis has prompted talk of a "democracy deficit," she said, as people in the different countries within the European Union complain that they have no say in important issues.
If its people vote "no" to the bailout plan, European leaders have made clear they will not hand over a sixth tranche of European funds from a previously agreed bailout.
The Greek government is expected to run out of money in mid-November, and that 8 billion euro (about $10.9 billion) tranche is needed to keep it afloat.
Europe must put provisions in place to allow Greece to leave the euro, if that becomes necessary, with minimum damage, she said.
"The priority now is to focus not on Greece but on the rest of Europe, in particular Italy, which is the country most likely to be affected," she said.
