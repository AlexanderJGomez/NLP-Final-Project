Apparently not, because so many people feel compelled to show us how clever they are by attempting to point out factual errors depicted in film after film.
The first is the current box office champion, "Gravity," with the other being "The Butler."
Despite its box office success, a chorus of critics have attacked numerous scientific flaws in the film -- such as pointing out the allegedly inaccurate way Bullock's hair floated in zero gravity.
And then there's "The Butler," the Lee Daniels film about a man who served for decades as a butler for various presidents at the White house.
Here's a spoiler alert (and by "spoiler alert," I mean a spoiler to people who have never googled or read anything about the film): It was fiction -- that means it was made up.
Sure, it was loosely inspired by the life of Eugene Allen, a man who served as a butler in the White House for 34 years for eight presidents, but the film was a fictionalized account.
But for all other movies, filmmakers should be afforded creative license to make the movie that fulfills their vision of the story they want to tell, even ones based on real events.
