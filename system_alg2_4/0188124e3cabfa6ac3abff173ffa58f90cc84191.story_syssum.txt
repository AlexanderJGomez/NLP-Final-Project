(CNN) -- Ian Livingstone may not be the father of Lara Croft, but maybe at 63 he can be labeled the grandfather of Lara, the Tomb Raider.
It was the very first character with 3-D model, in a 3-D that was a female character."
And we had to have her.
Up to then, games were played mainly by teenage boys and the games were made were also men, so they tended to make male heroes."
They got the exclusive European distribution rights to the board game on the back of ordering just six copies of D&D, according to Livingstone, and the set about trying to sell the games to stores.
"We had to live in a van for three months as we tried to get people to understand this strange role-playing game," Livingstone told me.
Now, with a CBE in the pocket and the honor title of Life President for Eidos -- a brand name now owned by Square Enix -- Livingstone is more of a advocate for the British video games and film graphics business.
"The curriculum was simply teaching children how to use technology, not how to make technology," Livingstone told me.
As Livingstone likes to point out, the UK games and graphics business is bigger than the film industry.
"And now it's a realistic character.
Here was this character that you played as Lara, who could sustain damage."
But not be raped, Livingstone told me, recalling a misstep by an employee who said last year that one scene could be seen as the prelude to a sexual assault.
With the reboot now out, it can't be long before we read of a new Lara Croft film with a new, younger, actress to set the mark for a new franchise.
