But then, I could see the fireworks from the rehearsal," Liu said through tears.
"I was listening to Lisa Ono (a bossa nova singer) with the volume up to the highest on the stereo that used to be here in the corner.
She also won many top cultural awards in China for dance plays.
I love dancing very much.
But I believe I will keep dancing or at least doing work related to that, because that is what I love."
But I think of it as a process," she said.
"I think you should not blame one person, or one particular moment," she said.
She also said she did not know about reports her family and witnesses to the accident were told not to talk about what happened afterward.
As for the future, Liu said she might go back to school, to learn more about dance, and get a master's or a doctorate degree.
I will live with hope."
