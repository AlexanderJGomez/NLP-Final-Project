You can take one home to your son,'" Knight said in an interview broadcast Tuesday on the syndicated "Dr. Phil" talk show.
And it wasn't long, Knight said, before he trapped her in an upstairs room and tied her up with an extension cord.
"I want my son to know me as a victor, not a victim," Knight told host Dr. Phil McGraw.
Castro lured Knight into his vehicle from a Family Dollar store in Cleveland in 2002, promising to give her a ride.
Knight, Berry and the third woman, Gina DeJesus, have since been trying to readjust to life as free women.
I mean, I said to her during the interview, 'Michelle, I will never complain about another thing the rest of my life,'" McGraw told CNN's AC 360.
Knight said she remembered the warning, the one Castro delivered while wrapping a chain around her neck and shackling her to a metal pole in the basement of his Cleveland home.
"That's where I tried to get out," Knight said.
Knight told McGraw that she didn't always fight back, though, at least not at first.
Knight, 32, was 21 years old when she was reported missing in 2002.
Castro, she said, would tell her of his plans to abduct other women and also implied he'd done it before.
And when she saw Berry, Knight said, she tried to comfort her.
"Sometimes she would cry, and I'd tell her everything would be OK, and that one day we'll get home," Knight told McGraw.
In the interview with McGraw, Knight said she once watched Castro kill a beloved dog by breaking its neck.
...
That's all he said,'" Knight recalled.
Knight told McGraw that her son was taken away after her mother's boyfriend abused him.
"I did all I could do."

In response, her mother, Barbara Knight, issued a statement to the "Dr. Phil" show.
I love my daughter.
I pray that someday she will heal enough to know that again."
