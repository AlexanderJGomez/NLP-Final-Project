Paul Montalbano's testimony in federal court on Tuesday came on the 11th day of proceedings to determine whether Hinckley can spend more time visiting his mother in Virginia and might eventually be released as a permanent outpatient.
Montalbano said he supports St. Elizabeths Hospital's plan to first give Hinckley two visits of 17 days and then six stays of 24 days.
Hinckley's experts say his most serious mental diseases are in remission, that he's made progress and can make even more if he's allowed more time outside his mental hospital.
The hearing resumes on Wednesday and could conclude this week.
U.S. District Court Judge Paul Friedman is expected to take some time to review all the evidence before issuing a ruling on the hospital's proposal.
