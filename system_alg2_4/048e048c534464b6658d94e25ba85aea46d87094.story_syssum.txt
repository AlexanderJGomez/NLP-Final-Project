Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- Geeta was 9 when she began wearing makeup, staying up until 2 a.m. and having sex with as many as 60 men a day.
The 61-year-old woman and her group, Maiti Nepal, have been fighting for more than 16 years to rescue and rehabilitate thousands of Nepal's sex trafficking victims.
By raiding brothels, patrolling the India-Nepal border and providing safe shelter and support services, Koirala and Maiti Nepal have helped rescue and rehabilitate more than 12,000 Nepali women and girls since 1993.
According to the U.S. State Department, some 10,000 to 15,000 women and girls from Nepal are trafficked to India and then sexually exploited each year.
"Every day, there was battering.
Maiti Nepal was her brainchild for giving voice, legal defense and rehabilitation to victims of sex trafficking.
The group has facilities throughout Nepal and India, but most of the rehabilitation work takes place at its main campus in Kathmandu, Nepal.
We let them play, dance, walk, talk to a friend," Koirala said.
Many of the staff are sex trafficking survivors now committed to helping rehabilitate other girls.
For these girls, Maiti Nepal becomes their new, and possibly last, home.
"The hardest part for me is to see a girl dying or coming back with different diseases at an [age] when she should be out frolicking," Koirala said.
People even forget [she is] HIV-positive or was trafficked," Koirala said.
They easily recognize a girl that is being trafficked or will be trafficked," Koirala said.
But Koirala says that among those rescued by Maiti Nepal, there isn't a single case when a girl has returned back to the streets.
She credits Koirala and Maiti Nepal for the strength to keep living and the confidence to join the fight against sex trafficking.
