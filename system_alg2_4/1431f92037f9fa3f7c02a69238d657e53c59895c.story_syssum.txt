Microsoft and Sony, which makes the PlayStation, are working to bolster their Internet-video offerings before new challengers can usurp the home-entertainment market that they've been cultivating for many years with their systems.
Sony plans to unwrap a new version of its video-download service for the PlayStation 3 on Tuesday.
"We want you to be able to search and browse in a nonlinear way," Michael Aragon, a vice president for Sony Network Entertainment, said in an interview.
Music Unlimited and Video Unlimited will live under the Sony Entertainment Network umbrella, and they may eventually be joined by the PlayStation Network, Aragon said.
The redesigned video service will be coming to Sony set-top boxes and Bravia TVs in the next few months, Aragon said.
The Sony tablet, which is set to debut early next month, will have a version of Video Unlimited, and the iPhone app will eventually include the ability to watch videos offline, he said.
Google has been unwavering in developing its Google TV platform, which Sony installs on a few of its products.
"It is your gaming system; it is your movies; it is your TV experience."
Microsoft plans to launch new video-on-demand and live TV services for Xbox in partnership with dozens of media companies, he said.
"Certainly we all know the frustrations of using guides and menus and controllers, and we think a better way to do all of this is simply to bring Bing and voice to Xbox," Ballmer said last month.
Netflix has about 24 million subscribers, and the game consoles have been a primary way people get the service.
"If you want to do subscriptions, you can't have new content," he said.
Microsoft and Sony would like to sell the media, not just the hardware that plays them.
