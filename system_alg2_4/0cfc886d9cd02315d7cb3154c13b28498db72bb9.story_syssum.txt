Once these octogenarian white men from another time die off, will we finally be free of empirical racism in America?
I went to Howard University in Washington.
But I also see others around me who, on the surface, may roll with a similar crowd, listen to the same music, say the right things, but who are also slowly being infected with the American disease of racial bias.
But we've got a black President, right?
As it should.
Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling learned this firsthand when NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned him for life.
But, for my generation, there are still real problems.
We Millennials are the "here today, gone tomorrow" type of activists.
It will not become extinct with the passing of the older generations.
When I was younger, maybe 10 or 11, I got into a fight with a neighbor kid who had just called me that magic word -- the "N" word.
That kid is much older now, also in his mid-20s.
Or has time and society shifted his adolescent feelings about me and others like me?
We watch it coming from our parents.
Within our generation are the remnants of a time long past.
It provides an unprecedented level of exposure and opportunity to interact with others not like ourselves.
So now, it falls upon a generation of young people to see the fight through.
It is our duty as a generation to teach ourselves discipline.
It will be on us.
