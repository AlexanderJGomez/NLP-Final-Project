(CNN) -- It's the worst-kept secret since Adam Lambert's sexuality: Apple is expected to unveil a new iPhone on Tuesday.
The rumor mill, you'll likely recall, revved to full throttle in early September when CNET reported that an Apple employee lost a prototype of the next iPhone -- likely called the iPhone 5 -- in a Mexican restaurant and bar in San Francisco.
-- The phone will be called the iPhone 5 or iPhone 4S.
-- The iPhone may come to Sprint, too.
-- The phone will have a "teardrop" back, meaning it's fatter at the top than the bottom, according to the blog This is My Next.
That e-mail Apple sent to journalists: "Let's talk iPhone."
Voice-recognition.
-- Based on Apple's past iPhone release patterns, the phone (or phones) will likely go on sale later this month (most bloggers predict mid-October).
And there are rumors that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who handed over the company to Cook in August following a medical leave of absence, will make an appearance at the event.
It wouldn't be the first time Cook helped with an Apple presentation -- he appeared onstage in January when the company unveiled an iPhone on Verizon's network -- but it would be his first time as headliner.
