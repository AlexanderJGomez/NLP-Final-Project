BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN)  -- Daniel Rendon Herrera, Colombia's most-wanted drug kingpin suspect, was arrested early Wednesday, Colombian President Alvaro Uribe announced at a news conference.
A live TV broadcast of his arrival at the Military Airport of Catam, on the outskirts of Bogota, showed a somber-looking Rendon being led off an airplane to a police van.
The president's Web site also carried news of the arrest.
Authorities nearly captured Rendon twice in the past few months, but he escaped, Santos said at the military airport.
Santos also issued a message Wednesday to a cartel suspect he identified only as "El Cuchillo," the Knife.
"We are getting close."
