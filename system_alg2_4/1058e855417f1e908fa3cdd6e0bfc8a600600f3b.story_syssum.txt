Los Angeles (CNN) -- San Diego Mayor Bob Filner, facing a growing tide of sexual harassment allegations, has completed his two-week intensive behavior therapy a week early and will begin outpatient treatment, his lawyer said.
In the same statement, Payne said Filner would take some personal time this week and would not be available for comment.

While Filner acknowledged last month that "I need help" and said "I'm clearly doing something wrong," he has also said he believes he will be vindicated when all the facts come out.
The idea that Filner has now completed rehab and could come back to lead San Diego did not sit well with many of his constituents.
You did what you did and now you want to stay as mayor," said William Sawaya, another San Diego resident.
