"It's been a nightmare," her mother, Bernadette Kero, told CNN on Wednesday.
"Never in a million years would I have thought that she'd be spending her birthday today in a prison," Kero said with tears in her eyes.
After working for 10 years as a vet and saving money, Addison quit her job, sold her home and belongings and set out to travel the world, setting aside a small nest egg for when she would eventually come home, Kero said.
The package was found to contain methamphetamine, Addison said on her Facebook page.
"The person who picked up the package, he told the police and he testified before the judge that he didn't know my daughter," Kero said.
He had just paid to hire the driver."
But rather than giving Addison her papers and letting her go, the court detained her again and sent her to Gleno prison outside Dili, a U.S. State Department official said.
The U.S. government is seeking "a fair and expeditious resolution to this case in accordance with Timorese law," the State Department official said.
For her first five days in Gleno prison, Addison was held on her own, according to Kero.
Kero said embassy staff have been "extremely supportive" in the case -- they brought Addison a birthday cake recently.
Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley's office is also working with the family, he said.
