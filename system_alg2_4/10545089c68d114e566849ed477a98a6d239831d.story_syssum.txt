The Louisiana Democrat chartered a private plane last September to travel from New Orleans to Shreveport, where she attended an official event.
However, if the campaign activity is "incidental" to the official trip, the expense doesn't need to be split up.
A Senate aide said that because Landrieu was already going to be in Dallas, the office considered the fundraiser incidental and not an expense that had to be partially covered by the campaign.
Landrieu's campaign spokesman, Fabien Levy, said in a statement Monday that the charter company mistakenly billed Landrieu's Senate office instead of her re-election campaign.
Levy told CNN that media scrutiny of Senate office expense reports spurred the campaign to review its travel records.
