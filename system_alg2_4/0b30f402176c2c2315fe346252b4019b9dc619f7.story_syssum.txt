Mark McGwire apparently felt it was the right thing to do.
Later, with tears streaming down his cheeks, McGwire told the media how, earlier that day, he had held the bat Roger Maris used when he set the old mark.

"Absolutely," McGwire said.
"The only reason I took steroids was for my health purposes," McGwire said.

And there lies the reason I have trouble forgiving and forgetting: Mark McGwire doesn't see it.
Pat Maris received her phone call.
