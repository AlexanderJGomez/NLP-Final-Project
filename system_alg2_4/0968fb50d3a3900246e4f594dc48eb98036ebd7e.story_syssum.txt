Washington (CNN) -- In less than a month, the government may shut down.
A continuing resolution?
It is a legislative tool designed to keep the government running when the president and Congress can't get it together.
A: It's a legislative trick to pay the bills.
And the one key duty laid out in the Constitution for Congress is to pass spending bills that fund the government.
So when Congress doesn't do its job, then it has to pass a continuing resolution, also referred to as a short-term spending bill or a stop-gap spending measure.
It is a bill that sidesteps the lengthy budget process and funds the government for a specified period of time.
And here we are.
And what does CR have to do with a government shutdown?
Congress "recognizes one of their leverages is the power of the purse," Ellis said, adding that politicization of the budget process has become more polarized during the Obama administration.
More often it's about spending levels and the size of the government.
A.
In 1995 and 1996, President Bill Clinton battled a Republican-led Congress over spending levels (his nemesis was then-Speaker Newt Gingrich).
A.
It often takes intense negotiating between the two chambers of Congress and the president.
Much to the dismay of Republicans, the Senate in recent years has failed to pass even a simple budget, a precursor to spending bills.
And even though the Senate finally passed a budget -- it did so in March after the House acted -- leaders in both chambers couldn't agree to start the process of combining their versions into a final bill.
House Republican leaders are well aware of the political risks of threatening to shut down the government.
CRs fund the government at the same level as the previous year.
A: It could.
But that's a different story for a different day.
