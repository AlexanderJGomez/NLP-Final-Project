(CNN) -- Negotiators for Iran and six world powers completed the first day of discussions on Iran's nuclear program Monday in Moscow.
Iran rejected calls during earlier talks for it not to enrich uranium to the point that it can be used for weapons, while the international powers refused Tehran's demand for an immediate end to sanctions weighing on its economy.
Israel, which is believed to have its own nuclear arsenal and is alarmed over Tehran's hostility toward the Jewish state, has said it may attack Iran to try to stop Tehran from developing nuclear weapons.
Iran's top negotiator, Saeed Jalili, struck a nuanced position after the Baghdad talks, asserting Iran's right to pursue peaceful nuclear energy but also saying that progress had been made during the meeting.
And because 80% of Iran's foreign revenues are derived from oil exports, an embargo by the EU set to go into effect in July will add further pressure.
The six world powers made Iran an offer for stopping its processing of medium-enriched uranium, EU officials said.
Adding to the complexity of the situation, a U.N. report released just after the Baghdad talks said that inspectors had found a high level of enriched uranium in Iran.
The previous highest level had been 20%, typically used for hospital isotopes and research reactors, but is also seen as a shortcut toward the 90% enrichment required to build nuclear weapons.
