Time for all those members of Congress to go home, meet with their constituents, get their input on health care reform and take back what they have learned from the voters.
Not exactly.
What about those folks who are actually interested in debating and discussing a very complex issue they're trying to digest?
Especially when it comes to an issue as complex as health care.
Their bad behavior is a derivative of the questionable quality of the political debate they listen to every day.
Too bad they actually support the rest of reform, and are still running positive ads about the effort.
I hate to sound like Pollyanna, but members of Congress are actually doing some real work.
One of those working the hardest, Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, was derided at a town hall recently on the matter of his own health insurance.
Maybe the discourse will become more productive as the summer progresses.
As John F. Kennedy told us, "To govern is to choose."
