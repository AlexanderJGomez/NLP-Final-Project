The commemoration by the President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins, will take place during the first state visit by an Irish leader to the United Kingdom.
The very fact that the British and the Irish once fought with each other under the same flag is still very difficult for many Irish Republicans to stomach.
The spokesperson stressed that both state visits are "pivotal moments in our shared history."
A palace spokesperson said last month that the Queen herself has become a symbol of the warming relationship between the two countries.
The significance of this week's state visit will be further underlined by the presence of McGuinness at a reception hosted by the Queen on Thursday afternoon at Windsor Castle - a move unthinkable only a decade ago.
