(CNN) -- Five more states reported widespread flu activity during the second week of January, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, bringing the total to 40 states.
The CDC does not have data on the number of adult flu deaths.
"As typical of a flu season, some areas are being harder hit than other areas," said CDC spokesman Tom Skinner.
He said that a year ago, only five deaths had been reported at this time; there were only 106 flu deaths during the entire 2012-2013 flu season.
H1N1 is the same virus that caused a pandemic in 2009, Dr. Michael Jhung, a medical officer in the CDC's flu division, has said.
Adult flu deaths are not required to be reported to the CDC, but the government agency must be notified of any flu deaths in children.
What consumers need to know is that it's not too late to take steps to protect yourself from getting the flu, said Dr. Susan Rehm, medical director for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.
"People who are young and healthy should be aware that they may get the flu and it could be serious," Rehm said.
