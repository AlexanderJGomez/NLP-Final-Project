(CNN) -- As Superstorm Sandy slammed into the East Coast on Monday night, one Twitter user in New York City posted a flurry of alarming reports about fallout from the storm -- from plans to shut down all power in Manhattan to floodwaters pouring into the New York Stock Exchange.
It all began Monday when Hurricane Sandy was approaching landfall and the owner of the Twitter account @ComfortablySmug, whose bio lists interests including "Finance, Gin, Politics, Books, Food, Fine Clothing (and) Meeting Strangers," began posting rapid-fire tweets to his 6,500 followers.
"BREAKING: Con Edison has begun shutting down all power in Manhattan," read one tweet.
And he contributed to the confusion surrounding reports, which proved to be false, that the New York Stock Exchange had flooded.
Stuef identified the account owner as Shashank Tripathi, a hedge fund analyst and campaign manager for a candidate for Congress.
While never giving his name, the account holder seemed to acknowledge as much Tuesday night in a post apologizing for his actions.
On Wednesday morning, Wight's campaign website said Tripathi had been replaced.
In a statement posted Wednesday afternoon on his campaign site, Wight said he was "shocked and disgusted" by Tripathi's behavior.
At least one elected official has asked that criminal charges be considered in the case.
"The Manhattan DA is taking this very seriously," Vallone, a Democrat, told Buzzfeed, while acknowledging it may be a hard case to make.
