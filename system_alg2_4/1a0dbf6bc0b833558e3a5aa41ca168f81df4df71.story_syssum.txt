(CNN) -- A surprise inspection by the Centers for Disease Control has resulted in a failing grade for one of the plushest cruise ships afloat.
One crew member who was on board the Silver Shadow said that his superiors ordered him and other crew members to sleep with food inside their cabins.
In fact, Gina Finocchiaro said the final grade was an 84, although it actually turned out to be 82.
Finocchiaro said the Silver Shadow inspection last month in Alaska was an anomaly.
"The CDC was alerted by crew members who were concerned about the hygiene on the ship and they went in and verified their complaints," he said.
The CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program employs inspectors from the U.S. Public Health Service and, even though it's a considered a regulatory program, it only has the authority to ask the cruise line to correct its actions.
This year, six cruise ships, including the Silver Shadow, have received failing grades by the CDC, according to its database.
Then there was February's Carnival Triumph cruise, which experienced an engine fire in the control room that led to a loss of electrical power for five days.
Disney Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean International and Holland America Line came in first, second and third, respectively, in customer satisfaction, while Carnival ranked last.
Silversea Cruises was not included in the survey, which survey measured seven factors that affect a customer's experience: service, state of the room, food, the efficiency of boarding and departing on the ship, entertainment, cost and excursions.
