But the world, Greek brothers Thomas and George Douzis realized, did not.
So, in 2007, the Douzis brothers developed a plan to take Greek produce to the global stage.
Take Greek olive oil's reputation around the world.
The brothers would find the best independent producers in the country and take their products global, with a guarantee of quality.
The brothers chose the brand Ergon -- the Greek word for project -- and set out to find the country's best produce.
The caliber was so high the area had been granted special status from the European Union.
But it was headed straight into an economic storm.
But by 2010, Ergon was an established brand, selling five lines of traditional products including spreads, canned fish, beans, mushrooms and wild truffles.
And many are doing so as expats, after being forced out of the country by the crisis.
Like many of his compatriots, his Greek bloodlines run strong and he set up Reload, in his words, to "let people do whatever they do, and find ways to connect them to Greece and help Greek communities."
Thomas Douzis is one of Reload's supporters.
Working for clients based around the world, Sifakis had a network of customers by the time he finished his service, and started working full-time.
"Truthfully, if I didn't have Greece, I wouldn't be in business," Sifakis says.
I have people there who have been working for me for many years."
"Greece can be successful if you find people who can inspire and lead the change," Sifakis says.
"Greece was wealthy back then, so we had to convince them that these two young brothers from Thessaloniki can do that job, that we can help them sell their products," he says.
Now, thanks to Ergon and despite the country's devastating crisis, their products are being enjoyed at a trendy restaurant just off Oxford Street, the main shopping hub in the heart of London.
