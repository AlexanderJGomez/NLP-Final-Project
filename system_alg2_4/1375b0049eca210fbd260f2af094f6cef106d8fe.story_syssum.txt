So says Wong How Man, a Hong Konger who in 1974 began leading expeditions into what was then one of the world's most isolated countries -- China.
In those early days China was only just opening up.
In 1985, when Wong led an expedition to find the source of the Yangtze River, he says he and his team traveled for nine days on horseback.
He returned 10 years later to find the same journey took just five days.
Now we could probably drive all the way to the source," says Wong, who began leading expeditions for National Geographic before setting up CERS.
Today Wong has to look harder to find truly out of the way places he deems worthy of exploration.
The often complex cultural and historical backgrounds of frontiers can make them especially interesting, but timing is everything when it comes to the exploring border regions.
During a visit two years ago to China's border with Vietnam, Wong said political unrest made exploration problematic.
China and India's political and trade ties are better than they've been for many years, opening it up to exploration.
"You can drive almost to the source of the Amur River, the 10th longest river in the world, and see the border troops talking to each other, people ice fishing and crossing the river even through they're not supposed to," says Wong.
Wong says the border between China's southwestern Yunnan province and Myanmar is also ripe for exploration, as it is free from the political complications of more sensitive areas close to Tibet or Vietnam.
If you're like a sprint runner, 'Oh, I got there first and I'm home already and on the computer sharing it on Facebook,' then I don't call it exploration," says Wong.
