BURBANK, California (CNN) -- Laura Ling on Wednesday expressed the shock she and Euna Lee felt when former President Clinton showed up in Pyongyang, North Korea, to help secure the two journalists' release.
North Korea pardoned Ling, 32, and Lee, 36, after Clinton's brief trip Tuesday to Pyongyang.

He expressed his gratitude to Clinton and President Obama and his administration who "have been deeply involved in this humanitarian effort."
The women were arrested in March while reporting from the border between North Korea and China.

"I am very happy that after this long ordeal, Laura Ling and Euna Lee are now home and reunited with their loved ones," Clinton said in a statement.
"We always maintained our hope and knew in our hearts that we would see Laura again; we just didn't know when," Lisa Ling said outside her home in Los Angeles, California.
Their release is a "source of happiness not only for the families but for the entire country," he said.
Clinton made the trip to North Korea after the women's families asked him to travel there, a senior administration official said.
In July, Ling and Lee spoke to their families and told them that the North Koreans were willing to grant them amnesty if a high-level envoy, such as former President Clinton, were willing to travel to Pyongyang, the administration official said on condition of anonymity.
North Korea said Clinton "expressed words of sincere apology to Kim Jong Il" for the journalists' actions, but the administration official said he knew nothing about an apology.
Gibbs added the former president last spoke with Obama during a White House visit in March.
North Korea and the United States had no regular contacts before a 1994 crisis over Pyongyang's nuclear program.
