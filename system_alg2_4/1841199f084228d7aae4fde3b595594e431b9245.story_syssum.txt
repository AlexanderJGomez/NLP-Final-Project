The embassy will continue to operate from the current building until the new one is completed in 2016 or 2017, the embassy said.
It was a year ago that the embassy announced it was looking for a new site that is more modern, open, and secure than the current building in London's West End.
The embassy moved to various locations in the West End before returning to Grosvenor Square in 1938.
The embassy moved to its current site, occupying the entire west side of the square, when the building was completed in 1960.
Neighbors complained the walls were unsightly, and the walls caused the road in front of the building to be closed to traffic.
