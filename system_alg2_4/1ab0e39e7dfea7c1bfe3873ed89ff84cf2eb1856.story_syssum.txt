WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A sharply divided House of Representatives narrowly passed a White House-backed climate change bill Friday after hours of cajoling and arm-twisting by Democratic leaders among members worried about the legislation's potential economic and political fallout.
"This is the biggest job-killing bill that has ever been on the floor of the House of Representatives.
This bill," Boehner said.
Congressional sources said Democrats were hoping their constituents would also attempt to match phone calls opposed to the bill with phone calls for the bill.
"Call your congressman, right now!"
"Now is the time for us to lead," Obama said during an appearance Thursday in the White House Rose Garden.
"I can't begin to tell you how many calls we've received," said Rep. Charles Gonzalez, D-Texas.
"And it's disproportionately vote 'no.'"
Having cleared the House, the bill now faces an unclear future in the Senate, where Democratic leaders have held off on introducing their own version of the legislation.
