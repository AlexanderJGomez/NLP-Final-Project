Police, in a criminal complaint on the incident, say "closed fist strikes" were used by the undercover police officers, but only to subdue the teenager as he tried to get away.
"My son tried to run thinking his life was in jeopardy," Terez Miles said.
The complaint says the police officers believed Miles was engaged in criminal activity and possibly armed with a "large heavy object."
A hearing in the case was scheduled for Thursday, but it was unclear whether the officers involved showed up, said Miles' attorney, Kerry Lewis.
He's met with the chief."
Lewis said Jordan Miles has no criminal record.
