The Jabra BT3030 can be purchased for around $39.99.
They are the Play/Pause key, the track shuffle keys, the volume controls, plus the multifunction Call key.
Just power it on via the multifunction Call button, and turn on the Bluetooth pairing mode on your cell phone.
The Jabra BT3030 comes with nice pair of ear buds that sit comfortably in the ear, but since it has a 3.5mm headset jack, you can use any headphones of your choosing.
When there's an incoming call during music playback, the music will pause and you will hear a ringing tone.
Call quality was mixed.
The Jabra BT3030 also comes with an optional clothing clip accessory, plus an AC adapter.
