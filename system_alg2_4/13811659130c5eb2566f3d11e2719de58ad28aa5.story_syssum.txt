This year's Photo of the Year, taken by Paul Hansen, is a striking image of the bodies of two young children carried through the streets of Gaza City after an Israeli airstrike on their home, the photographer said.
Their mother was hospitalized.
This year's final round of judges were a global mix, Lyon said.
The Gaza City photo accomplished that, Lyon said.
The story behind the photo started the day before it was shot, he said.
The doctor told the story of a Gaza City family whose home had been destroyed in an Israeli airstrike.
"You can see that they're dead, but it's not gruesome in any other way besides emotion," he said.
The emotion of the photograph remains strong for Hansen as well.
Lyon, the jury chair, said the judges looked at the photograph for its power.
We don't shy away from showing reality."
