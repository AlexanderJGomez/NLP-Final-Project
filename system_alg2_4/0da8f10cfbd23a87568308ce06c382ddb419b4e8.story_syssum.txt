(CNN) -- In the scorching desert of Qatar, scientists are showing that saltwater can be used to help grow crops.
Our starting point was to take what we have enough of -- seawater, heat -- and use it to produce what we need more of -- water, energy and a sustainable production of food."
"Qatar is one of the most challenging climates in the world to work in for this kind of thing," says Dr. Virginia Corless, the science and development manager.
The facility features a concentrated solar power plant, which turns heat into steam, then, with turbines and generators, into electricity, which in turn pumps seawater to the site, where it is used to cool the greenhouses.
Lastly, the saltwater is also used to cultivate algae, which can be used for large-scale bio-energy production -- though currently the algae plant is still in the research phase.
"The biggest issues right now are climate change and water resources globally, and these simple technologies can tackle both," he says.
Some experts, however, question if the Sahara Forest Project is the best use of resources.
Despite the mixed reviews, Hague says that the site has proven itself with the new crop influx, adding that many skeptics have been won over.
