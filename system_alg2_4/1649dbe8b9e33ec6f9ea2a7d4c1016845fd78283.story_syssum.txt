Far from the media frenzy dominating headlines, from the so-called "ground zero mosque" to a pastor's planned Quran burning, Aman Ali and Bassam Tariq traveled more than 13,000 miles into the heart of America over the last month, visiting 30 mosques in 30 days for Ramadan.
"After 13,000 miles, I think that America still exists, and I'm happy to know that it does," said Tariq, a 23-year-old American of Pakistani descent.
"It's really made America feel like home to me in a way that I've never felt before.
When he approached the fisherman after their car broke down, Tariq says, he didn't know how he'd be received.
"
"That, to me, is really what this country is about."
For Ali, his favorite moment was Ross, North Dakota, a blip of a town with a population of 48 people.
As he approached the mosque, his heart pounded.
Praying in there was like hopping in a time machine," said Ali, a 25-year-old Muslim who was born in Columbus, Ohio.
Tariq said their blog also helps the rest of America realize "you have to accept Muslims are here in America to stay, and we've been here for awhile.
As for what's next for the young men, they plan to celebrate Eid with their Muslim brethren in Dearborn, Michigan -- happy to have discovered an America that still embraces them, even if that's not always portrayed in the news media.
