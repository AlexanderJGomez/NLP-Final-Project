An aerial endeavor that would take 17-year-old pilot Haris Suleman and his father, Babar, around the world in just 30 days and into the record books.
Haris had been due home in Indiana on Saturday, his sister Hiba Suleman told reporters Wednesday.
Her father wouldn't have let Haris take off if the weather was bad, she said.
He was doing something adventurous," she said of her brother, who received his pilot's license in June.
He also told how he and his father had received survival training in case of having to ditch their plane in the water.
The principal of the high school where Haris was a rising senior said the school was deeply saddened by his death.
"Haris' adventurous spirit and huge heart led him to reaching for this personal goal while also seeking to raise funds and awareness for schools supported by The Citizens Foundation, a nonprofit organization headquartered in Karachi, Pakistan," said Melvin Siefert, principal of Plainfield High School.
His sister said Haris planned to be an engineer like his father.
The next legs of the trip were supposed to cross the Pacific Ocean, with stops in Kiritimati (also known as Christmas Island) and Hawaii.
The National Transportation Safety Board said the plane was a Beechcraft Bonanza A36.
