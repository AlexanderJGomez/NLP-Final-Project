New York (CNN) -- Judson Box has never known exactly how his son, Gary, died on September 11, 2001.
But it was not Gary.
Box scoured photo archives of the National 9/11 Museum and the memorial's website, which allows users to upload photos from 9/11 directly to the site.
"I was out of out control, emotionally," Box said.
Several months later, the museum gave him the e-mail address of Erik Troelson, a Danish businessman who was stranded in the tunnel on his way to a meeting when he snapped the picture of Gary.
"Gary Box was one of the guys."
Box and Troelson corresponded via e-mail for months, with Troelson doing his best to recall the day's timeline of events.
Nine years after September 11, Box said he still feels the pain of that day.
"We need that in this country because too many people forget," Box said of the museum.
