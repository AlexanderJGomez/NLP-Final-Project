In practice, it means official eating/drinking fests involving multiple rounds of alcohol at multiple venues.
"My boss was a graduate of Korea University [renowned for its hardy drinking culture] and at my first hoesik, we started out with everyone filling a beer glass with soju, and downing it on the spot.
"I didn't really like it in the beginning," says Charles Lee, a Korean-Canadian who came to Seoul to work for a South Korean company.
But when someone offers you a glass of soju, it's an invitation that means that they want to listen to you.
Mondays are a big night for hoesik, so there are fewer cars during evening rush hour, as most office workers leave them at work so they can go drinking.
One of the first things Koreans often ask when meeting someone new is their age.
If a senior person is pouring -- this usually pertains to hard liquor only -- others shouldn't drink until someone has poured the senior a shot.
By raising your glass or pouring alcohol with one hand, you are establishing yourself as a senior person.
Hoesik usually involves changing venues for a different type of alcohol -- i.e., round one is dinner, accompanied by beer, round two is soju, round three is for whiskey, and so on.
Sorry, but "I don't like soju" doesn't qualify as a good reason not to punish your liver.
One of the most popular venues in Korea for business drinking is the karaoke bar.
This entails a person of your choosing drinking your glass for you, but it also means they get a wish.
Bottoms up.
