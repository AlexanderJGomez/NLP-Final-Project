Devon Byrd, 16, and Wade White, 18, were killed when a natural gas tank at a well production site exploded last fall in Carnes, in southern Mississippi.
Investigators say they found a lighter, but don't know whether it was involved.
The Chemical Safety Board, created by Congress, investigated the accident and found at least 40 other deaths involving oil and gas wells in the past 25 years.
"If these tanks are sitting out there in the middle of nowhere, no protection around them, no warning, they are just an accident waiting to happen," CSB Chairman John Bresland told CNN.
"But there's nothing in the rules for him to be in compliance with."
It's called "No Place to Hang Out," and it's part of a national campaign starting this week to teach young people about the potential danger of tanks.
"There's nothing we can do to bring Devon and Wade back, " said White's girlfriend, Maria Thompson, 16.

Mississippi state Sen. Billy Hudson told CNN he plans to introduce a state law requiring barbed-wire-topped fences, locked gates and "Danger - Keep Out" signs.
