(CNN) -- In the face of Republican opposition, the Senate confirmed President Barack Obama's nominee to be deputy secretary of state Tuesday.
John McCain of Arizona and Marco Rubio of Florida made it clear at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing that they would oppose Blinken's nomination.
McCain pointed to statements Blinken made then that "Iraq has never been so prosperous, so powerful, and peaceful as it is today," as reason enough for preventing his nomination.
Menendez said Blinken's statements were part and parcel of those of an official who was duty bound to advocate on behalf of that administration.
