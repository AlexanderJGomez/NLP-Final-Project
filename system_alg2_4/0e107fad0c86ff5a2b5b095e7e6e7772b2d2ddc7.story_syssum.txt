The U.S. Navy on Tuesday announced it was canceling all the air shows its Blue Angels Flight Demonstration Squadron had scheduled for the rest of the year.
The Air Force had said earlier this year that air shows can cost bases $100,000.
The Navy team had also canceled a performance set for MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, last weekend.
The Navy said the Blue Angels will continue to train at their base in Pensacola, Florida, for when the budget crunch ends.
The Navy intends to continue aerial demonstrations in the future as the budget situation permits," the service's statement said.
