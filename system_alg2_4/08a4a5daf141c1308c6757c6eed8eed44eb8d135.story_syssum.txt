As rector of the formerly all-white educational institution in Bloemfontein, South Africa, Jansen is about to use his graduation ceremony speech to teach his students one last lesson.
Jansen, the first black dean of education at the University of the Free State, is one of South Africa's leading academics and intellectuals.
Life was tough for the future educator, coming of age in a country plagued by apartheid -- he says that growing up as a black boy in Cape Flats, there was a "greater chance" of going to prison than going to university.
A firm believer of the society's responsibility to insist on a qualitative education system, Jansen,  a Fulbright scholar, assumed his current role at the University of the Free State in 2009 after the institution faced controversy over racism and racial integration.
Citing reconciliation "on a deeply divided campus," Jansen decided to invite the students to return to the university and resume their studies, regardless of their legal consequences.
"If in the process of forgiving and reconciling, we enable other transformations to take place, which is exactly what happened, then that is a better way to go than the thirst -- the understandable thirst let me say -- for vengeance," he says.
