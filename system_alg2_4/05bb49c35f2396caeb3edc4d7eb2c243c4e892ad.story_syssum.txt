(CNN) -- There are few more concrete examples of the longtime rift between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland than the walled city on the River Foyle.
This weekend, however, Derry-Londonderry plays host to an event its organizers hope can help unite this divided city, at least for a few days.
And we're going there in the hope that ... maybe people who haven't felt comfortable standing next to each other in the streets will find an opportunity to do that," said Helen Marriage, co-director of Artichoke, a London-based company that stages large-scale public events across the UK.
Each have drawn throngs of people who packed the streets, faces bright with wonder, to witness their city be transformed if only for a moment into something magical.
Marriage had to persuade skeptical city officials to shut down parts of central London and reroute traffic while convincing them the event wasn't just a piece of frivolous disruption.
And we'd like to shut the city (down) for four days,'" she said.
"I used to go to these meetings and say, 'Please, may I do this?'
How can you help me?'
The event, "The Sultan's Elephant," was a huge success in May 2006.
"It's always an incredible moment when the city is returned to the people who live and work there.
And they can wander freely as if in a playground, for no better reason than something is happening that they love.
Marriage and her team followed that in 2009 with "One & Other," which took over London's Trafalgar Square for 100 days and nights.
The event began in July and ran for 2,400 hours, day and night, with a new person occupying the plinth each hour.
Some played music.
"People used it in incredibly imaginative ways," Marriage said.
Then came the first Lumiere festival, held in November 2009 in Durham, a small medieval city in northern England.
The success of Lumiere in Durham inspired Marriage to double down this year on the festival in Derry-Londonderry.
But Marriage is optimistic.
