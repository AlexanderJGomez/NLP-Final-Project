New York (CNN) -- The woman accusing former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn of sexually assaulting her insisted she was "telling the truth from my heart," in an interview broadcast Monday.
The 32-year-old hotel maid, whose credibility has been called into question by prosecutors and Strauss-Kahn's lawyers, said she was terrified when she found out how powerful Strauss-Kahn was.
"  That's because in her native Guinea, West Africa, accusing "a powerful man like that" would put her life in danger, she said.
He was charged in New York with sexual abuse and attempted rape, pleading not guilty on all counts.
And, her lawyers know that her claim for money suffers a fatal blow when the criminal charges are dismissed as they must be," the statement said.
In addition to the state case, Thompson said Monday that he plans to file a lawsuit this week against Strauss-Kahn on behalf of Diallo.
Prosecutors said she admitted lying on the asylum application about having been a victim of a gang rape, even providing details of that attack.
"I was like, 'Stop this, stop this,' " she said in the interview.
...
She said she was "nervous" and "scared" when she eventually ran from Strauss-Kahn's hotel room, ending an incident that took about 15 minutes.
Diallo filed a libel lawsuit against the New York Post and five of its reporters after the newspaper reported that the woman accusing Strauss-Kahn was a prostitute.
"Because of him, they call me a prostitute," Diallo said in the Newsweek interview, blaming Strauss-Kahn for the accusations.
"To protect the integrity of the criminal justice system, the rights of the victim and the rights of the accused, we will not discuss the facts or evidence in what remains an ongoing investigation," she said in a statement.
