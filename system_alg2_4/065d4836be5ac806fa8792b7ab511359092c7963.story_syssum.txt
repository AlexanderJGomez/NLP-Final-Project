(CNN) -- Gasps punctured the air inside Boston Symphony Hall after the conductor interrupted the afternoon performance to announce to the 2,500 people in the audience that President Kennedy had been assassinated.

As the group walked to the concert hall, several orchestra members openly wept, but Silverstein says they still managed to take their seats.

Seated at the end of a row, closest to the audience, Silverstein watched the stunned people react to the news.
The funeral march lasted for 12 minutes, what seemed like an eternity to Silverstein.
