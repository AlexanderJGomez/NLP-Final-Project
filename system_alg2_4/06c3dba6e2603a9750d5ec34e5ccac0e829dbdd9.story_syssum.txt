Greg Bernal of Florissant, Missouri, and girlfriend Janet Momphard of St. Charles, Missouri, on Tuesday hauled what is believed to be a world record catfish into their boat while fishing on the Missouri River.

Jim Blair, who keeps a state-certified scale at his feed store in New Melle, was notified Tuesday morning by the Missouri Department of Conservation that a couple may have caught a state record catfish and they needed to use his scale to get an official weight.
Before the catfish was put on the scale, Momphard said it had to at least weigh more than 120 pounds, because it weighed more than the generator Bernal kept in the back of his truck.
"Back in 1995, I caught the Illinois state record catfish -- a blue that weighed 79.12 pounds," said Bernal.
Bernal is keeping the catfish, for the time being, in a friend's deep freezer.
I was just lucky, but I'm not going to argue with it, that's a world record," Bernal said.
