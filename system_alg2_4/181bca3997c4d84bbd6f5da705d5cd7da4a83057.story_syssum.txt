Mexico City (CNN) -- An explosion rocked the offices of Mexico's state oil company Thursday, killing at least 25 people and injuring 101, Mexico's interior minister said.
The explosion tore through the building "from the inside out," he said, and rescuers found many people trapped.
It was unclear what caused the blast, and Mexico's attorney general's office is investigating, Pemex said in a statement.

Images from the scene showed emergency rescue teams carrying people on stretchers.
Pena Nieto cautioned against speculating over what caused the blast, and said authorities would be closely investigating.
The explosion occurred in an annex building just to the east of the tower, Foreign Minister Jose Antonio Meade said.
As they combed through the rubble, a Pemex executive's cell phone rang, Rangel said.
"Unfortunately, we lost communication with him," Rangel said.
