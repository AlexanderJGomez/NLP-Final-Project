Jean-Pierre Alfano of AirJet Designs and Frédérique Houssard, the founder of Designescence, have teamed up to create the Casino Jet Lounge, a luxe bar-cum-casino they hope will one day become standard on long-haul commercial flights.
The concept is relatively new (launched last October), so as of now, Houssard and Alfano are still in talks with various airlines.
In the 1990s, Swissair installed gambling software that allowed passengers to bet up to $350 on a variety of casino classics, including poker, keno and blackjack.
However, the idea of in-flight gambling re-emerged a few years ago.
"Casinos were just an idea, along with many other ideas we talked about a few years ago," a Virgin spokesman told CNN.
Ryanair announced in 2004 that it would introduce gambling through an in-flight entertainment system, though this too has yet to come to fruition.
For starters, as more carriers are unrolling Wi-Fi on their flights, passengers could feasibly just gamble online from their mobile devices.
Houssard and Alfano also don't see online gambling as competition to their own concept.
The Casino Jet Lounge isn't just a bar or entertainment idea.
The space could be easily rearranged to include a social space, without representing a loss of revenue," he says.
A lot of things are changing."
