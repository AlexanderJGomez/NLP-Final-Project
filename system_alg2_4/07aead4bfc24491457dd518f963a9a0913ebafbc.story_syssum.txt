(CNN) -- Young women at a party attended by about 50 Central Washington University students and other young people were the primary target of spiked drinks, authorities said Saturday.
They said several people at the party used vodka from the bottle to make mixed drinks.
Officers initially responded to an 11:09 p.m. call Friday about a female found unconscious in a vehicle in a grocery store parking lot, Ferguson said.
She exhibited signs of having ingested a spiked drink, Ferguson said, and was taken to the hospital and later released.
None of the underage people who overdosed meant to get high or unconscious, said Ferguson, and none had more than one or two drinks, KOMO reported.
The woman found in the parking lot remained in the hospital Saturday in stable condition, police said.
The owner of the home was not at the party, police said.
The school will hold information sessions Saturday and Sunday at residence halls, the statement said.
