(CNN) -- First, let's be clear: No one can blame voters if they a) are turned off by this election, b) are worried more about other things in their lives and c) don't think that it matters much who controls the Senate, which is what is up for grabs this year.
Except for this: When the show is over, and if control of the Senate changes to the Republicans, it could matter.
But rather, in the it's-in-my-self-interest-to-get-something-done kind of way.
In a midterm election, that can work: Obama is unpopular, tie all candidates to Obama.
Ah, you say, but what about President Obama?
The issue that comes to mind, of course, is immigration reform—which has been hanging out there so long it just gets messier and messier.
But if the GOP actually wants to win a presidential election, author Nate Cohn writes, "the Republicans will need a substantial number of Hispanic votes."
Or would they actually like to become a presidential party once again?
Then there's another logic that takes hold when you try to set the table for a presidential candidate, and campaign—no matter what some party diehards argue.
Sure, it depends on the GOP candidate.
And it also depends on President Obama.
And one of the biggest is whether Republicans—after more than four years out of the White House—have learned how tough it is to run the country from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.
