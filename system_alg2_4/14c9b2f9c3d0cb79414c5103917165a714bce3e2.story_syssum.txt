(CNN) -- Netflix has a new logo, but you're forgiven if you didn't notice.
But here's the strange part: Netflix acts as if the new logo doesn't exist.
Nor has Netflix mentioned the new logo on its social media pages, its website or even its iconic red DVD envelopes, which continue to show the traditional branding.
"Maybe Netflix is afraid that loyal customers will be disgusted by the new design, like what happened with the Gap a few years back, so they'd like to pass the baton from one logo to another slowly and quietly," wrote Mark Wilson for Fast Company.
"I can see why they'd want to move away from a logo that says 'this service is mostly for movies' since they're making a big push for original TV-style content, but this revision loses the cinema aspect without gaining anything to replace it."
