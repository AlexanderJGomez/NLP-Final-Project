The rebels contend that the peacekeepers entered a Syrian village near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, an area where peacekeepers should not be and where intense fighting has been raging for days between rebels and government forces.
In one, a rebel insists that the peacekeepers will be held until al-Assad's forces withdraw from the village of al-Jamlah, where there has been heavy fighting.
"We demand from America, U.N. and the Security Council to intervene and get al-Assad forces to withdraw, then we will release these detainees," the rebels say.
The 21 peacekeepers are Filipino, the Philippine government said Thursday.
"The blood of the people of Syria will be a curse on the whole world if there" is "no effective action," it said.
There has been "hardly a Syrian village spared from the regime bombing" the letter said.
Also on Wednesday, a massive explosion ripped through the city of Raqqa, two days after rebels claim to have captured this provincial capital.
It's the first time I witnessed such ugly images," said Ahmed Tayar, a writer and resident of Raqqa who saw the aftermath of the mysterious blast.
"I thinks it's the regime who killed those people, and that is because the regime wants to take revenge against Raqqa because that it's the first province that was fully liberated," Tayar told CNN.
On Tuesday, eyewitnesses told CNN residents were fleeing rebel-controlled Raqqa, as government war planes bombed targets in the city.
