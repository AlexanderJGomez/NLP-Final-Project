"Frequency modulation," exclaims South African radio shock jock Gareth Cliff in an online video posted earlier this year.
Sure, there may now be digital radio and more interaction between programs and their listeners today, Cliff explains.
The idea is to engage directly with listeners (and attract advertisers) and the early benefits are many, Cliff says.
"Mobile is definitely where the action is," Cliff says.
South Africa will remain the largest smartphone market in Africa in the near-term with more than a million units being shipped there each month, the IDC said last year.
The most intriguing development, however, is what Cliff Central is doing on the hugely popular mobile communication app, WeChat.
I don't know if that's a lot or a few as I don't really have a frame of reference to compare it to," Cliff explains.
"I think that's a real value proposition to an audience," Cliff says.
Closer to Cliff Central in South Africa, other web-only stations have popped-up in recent years.
Broadcast radio remains popular, free to listen to and attractive for advertisers, Botha adds.
Then there are the potential added data costs for listeners streaming content on their phones.
The people who really know about these things (media, digital advertising and branded content) are as excited about this as we are," he adds.
