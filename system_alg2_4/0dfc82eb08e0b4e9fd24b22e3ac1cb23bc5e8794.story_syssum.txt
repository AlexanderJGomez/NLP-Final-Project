No one has found the 276 girls abducted from their school last month by the terror group Boko Haram.
The father's voice shakes as he recalls the night his two daughters were snatched from their dormitory at an all-girls school in Nigeria.
"When I went into the school compound, nobody will ever stand it," said the father, who is not being identified for fear of reprisals from attackers or the government.
Armed members of Boko Haram attacked the school on April 14, overpowering the guards and herding the girls onto waiting trucks, according to accounts of that night.
In the days after the attack, the military said all the girls had been released or rescued.
"We're not Americans.
"We have never seen any military man there," he said.
They know his family, the father says.
The father said that starting around 5 or 6 o'clock in the evening, "people will disappear into the bush because there is no security."
"We sleep in the bush with all of our little ones," he said.
I will sell them in the market, by Allah," said a man claiming to be Abubakar Shekau.
I will sell women.
The mother of the two girls had little response, just tears.
They adopted one of their two daughters after her parents were killed by the terrorist group.
Please ... release them."
