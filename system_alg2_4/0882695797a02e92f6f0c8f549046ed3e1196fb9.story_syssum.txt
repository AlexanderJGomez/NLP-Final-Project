About 10 minutes after launch, a cheer went up in the company's flight control room in Dulles, Virginia, outside Washington, when the craft separated from the second stage of the booster.
The launch had been scheduled for Tuesday, but was postponed for a day because of bad weather and a technical glitch that delayed the craft's roll-out on Friday, NASA said.
Unlike the SpaceX Dragon capsule, which is designed to be reused and eventually carry passengers, the can-shaped, 17-foot Cygnus is a one-shot craft that will burn up on re-entry after its flight to the space station.
Orbital has a $1.9 billion contract with NASA to make eight flights to the space station under the space agency's commercial supply program.
