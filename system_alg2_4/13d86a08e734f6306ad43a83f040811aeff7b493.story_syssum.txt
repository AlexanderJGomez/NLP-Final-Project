(MMN.com) -- Lulu and I have had our share of training issues, from mastering the down command to heeling during walks.
Dog trainer Sarah Wilson suggests that the whole family try an old-fashioned game of hide and seek.
"Come is the command people practice the least," says Wilson, founder of an online training forum called My Smart Puppy.

Upshur tells owners to walk with confidence and move away from distractions such as stray dogs or children playing.
"The dog needs to know that the owner is not going to let anything happen," he says.
