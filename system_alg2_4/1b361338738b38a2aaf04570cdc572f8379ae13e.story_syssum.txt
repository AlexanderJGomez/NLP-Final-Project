But that's how many Mac users are feeling after the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Orbitz was steering Mac users toward higher-priced hotels than PC users, based on spending habits discovered by one of the site's algorithms.
"What we have found is ... that Mac users are 40% more likely to book four- or five-star hotels than PC users," Harford said.
Others argued that buying a pricier computer would leave them less money for a vacation and make them more inclined to seek travel deals.
You may see different promoted products on many sites depending on whether you're using a mobile app or a desktop.
Orbitz data show that Mac users are likely to spend $20 more a night on a hotel than PC users, on average, Harford said.
We are really excited about the potential to use this wisdom ... to make travel better for consumers," he said.
