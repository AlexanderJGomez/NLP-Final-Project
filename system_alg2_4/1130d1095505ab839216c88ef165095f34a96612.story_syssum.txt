Bernstein: I think it's a little emotional, even though he was 95 years old.
He was one of many sources in Watergate who had both the intelligence and the courage to tell the truth.
AM: The way that he was portrayed by Hal Holbrook in "All the President's Men" was he would give your partner Bob Woodward a little bit of a tease and say, "I'm not going to tell you anything more than that; you've got to follow the trail."
Bernstein: Yeah.
So I think Mark Felt's confirming this information (and occasionally he gave us some important information that we hadn't obtained, toward the end, elsewhere), it was absolutely invaluable.
Bernstein: To both of us.
And we went to see Mark Felt, and we had a kind of wonderful couple of hours with him.
Bernstein: First time I had met him, yes.
But I was amazed at his relative vigor given the fact that he had been quite ill.
Would you agree?
It's an important lesson, I think, for the country and for people in our business, as well.
