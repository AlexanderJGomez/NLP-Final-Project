Washington (CNN) -- The sweeping health care reform law championed by President Barack Obama was upheld as constitutional by another federal appeals court Tuesday.
Three appeals court have upheld the law, while one has ruled it unconstitutional.
It is unclear whether the high court will include this latest ruling with the other pending health care cases already on its docket.
A federal appeals court in Atlanta, considering that suit, had earlier found a key provision of the law to be unconstitutional.
The justices now have the discretion to either frame the case around the "severability" question -- whether the individual mandate section can be separated from the rest of the law -- or expand it to include other legal questions raised in the appeals.
Health care reform, a top Democratic priority since the Truman administration, was passed by the previous Congress in a series of virtually party-line votes.
Among other things, the measure was designed to help millions of uninsured and underinsured Americans receive adequate and affordable health care through a series of government-imposed mandates and subsidies.
Republican leaders, who captured the House of Representatives in the midterm elections, have vowed to overturn or severely trim the law.
