New York (CNN) -- Jorge Munoz is a bus driver in New York City who started feeding the hungry in Queens five years ago, using food that would otherwise have been thrown away.
Here is an edited transcript.
Jorge Munoz: In the beginning it was to try to avoid wasting food in the garbage.
So in Jackson Heights I saw people waiting on the corner, and I asked them what they were doing and they said they had no money for food.
So I called my mom and I said I had people to give the food to.
What do you provide for people?
But every day we make 120 to 140 meals.
And this time of the year, on the website, I ask for coat donations.
Munoz: Because I have a family at my house and I have a second family out there.
At least we provide a little something, and the only thing we ask in return is a smile.
Munoz: To become a CNN Hero, being nominated, it's a great honor for me, for my family and for my country [Colombia].
One example, there was a teacher in Afghanistan and she e-mailed me saying she wanted to start a small meal program in their town because of my story.
Munoz: That was a great honor.
Munoz: My mom.
Munoz: If you share, share anything you have you're not using like clothes, toys, share it to make other people happy.
If you see someone standing on the corner and have $2, buy them a cup of coffee and a piece of bread.
Share.
So share, it's a beautiful thing.
