ABUSIR, Egypt (CNN) -- Today, I met Cleopatra's lawyer.
According to the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities, it's here, at a spot known as Abusir, that the tomb of Marc Antony and Cleopatra might be located.
"I got very upset.
The last queen of Ancient Egypt, she told me, "spoke nine languages, she was a philosopher, she was a poet, she was a politician, she was a goddess, and she was a warrior."
It was "bad propaganda," in Martinez's words.
Marc Antony was a no less fascinating character than Cleopatra.
Egypt was the enemy of his former ally, Octavian, who would go on to become the Emperor Augustus, the first emperor of Rome.
The sudden focus on Antony and Cleopatra has also reignited an old debate over the latter's looks.
Was Cleopatra a stunning beauty a la Elizabeth Taylor, or somewhat less spectacular?
At Abusir, he showed me one of the coins with Cleopatra's likeness.
Plutarch wrote in his "Life of Antony" that "for her beauty was in itself not altogether incomparable, nor such as to strike those who saw her."
In any event, it's just one of many mysteries in Egypt.
Who built them?
There has been plenty of excitement in the past few days over reports that Martinez and her team are about to find the long-lost tomb of Antony and Cleopatra.
For security reasons, no one is allowed on the hillside where the excavations are taking place from May through November.
I guess we can wait a few more months.
