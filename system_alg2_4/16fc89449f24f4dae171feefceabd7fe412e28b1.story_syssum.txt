Malware also can sign you up for "premium SMS" text messaging services.

If it were even possible to run the same types of analytics on a mobile phone, that would destroy battery and take two decades to build," Mahaffey said.
Mahaffey notes that if your phone is running an older version of the Android operating system, you face greater mobile security risks.
Unless you've rooted your Android phone to gain complete control over it, it's up to the carrier and manufacturer, not you, when your phone will get a system update.
So some cheaper phones simply are not able to run the latest version of Android well, or at all.
Also, check your phone bill online periodically -- probably more often than once a month.
"If your battery suddenly starts draining really fast, consider that it might be malware," Mahaffey said.
