At the border, before going back to China, a group of security guards confiscated my camera and erased all images they thought were inappropriate, or did not portray the country in a favorable light.
But with the help of a computer expert in Hong Kong, I managed to get all the pictures back.
We also talked about why the outside world has such a negative view of North Korea; something he was very sad about.
"No problem," said my guide.
My guide had a hard time keeping up with me, but he never once told me to lower my camera or slow down.
And in the evening I sat down with a couple of young women from the local tourist office and had a conversation -- in Mandarin through an interpreter -- about relationships and everyday life in North Korea.
After breakfast I decided to go for a walk alone.
The real setback happened just minutes before I was to cross the Tumen River and go back to China.
My guide said they were erasing "inappropriate" pictures, with no further explanation.
Back in Hong Kong I got in contact with a small IT company that specializes in data recovery.
Looking at the censored photos, I was surprised about the selection.
Why these images are not in line with North Korean image guidelines is for me a mystery.
But so are a lot of things about the world's most isolated country.
