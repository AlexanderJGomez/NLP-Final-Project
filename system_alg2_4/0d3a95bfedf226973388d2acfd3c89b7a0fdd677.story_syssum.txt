McCurry restaurant owners A.M.S.P Suppiah and his wife Kanageswary Suppiah.
The country's Federal Court on Tuesday ruled that it didn't.
McDonald's filed suit two years later.
"We were shocked that such a big giant wants to take us to court," Suppiah said.
Furthermore, it said, the "Mc" in McCurry stands for "Malaysian Chicken Curry."
McDonald's said it accepts the judgment.
