Beijing, China (CNN) -- In a round-table meeting with government advisers and researchers of a government-run think tank on April 14, Premier Wen Jiabao enjoined them to listen to people's voices and relay these truthfully to top leaders.
"I don't think it is in contradiction to the party's crackdown on dissents," says Wenfang Tang, a political science professor at Ohio University.
The fall of these regimes has raised the spectre of a Chinese "jasmine revolution."
More than 30 years after Chairman Mao's death, the Communist regime has built one of the most successful authoritarian governments in the world, delivering double-digit economic growth while keeping its one-party grip.
They do not care what other people and countries will say."
"But the challenges of growing social injustice, environmental damage and sustaining high economic growth will continue to haunt the leaders."
At the same time, Chinese leaders try to project a sense of calm and normalcy.
The solution, he replied, was political reform--but reform that is gradual and led by the Communist Party.
Instead, says the retired Communist Party official, "he advocates transparency and accountability so as to effectively solve problems, avoid chaos and consolidate the Party's leadership."
Says Professor Wenfang Tang: "The question is whether Wen's effort to promote inner-party democracy will have a spill-over effect on political opposition outside the party.
Some observers wonder if Wen's pronouncement is just part of a "good cop, bad cop" charade, with Wen playing the reform-minded leader and President Hu Jintao playing the hard liner.
His two five-year terms will end in March 2013, after which he is expected to go into semi-retirement.
