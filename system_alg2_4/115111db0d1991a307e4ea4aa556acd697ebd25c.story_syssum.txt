Los Angeles (CNN) -- A former Los Angeles school district teacher pleaded no contest Friday to 23 felony counts of lewd acts on 23 children and was immediately sentenced to 25 years in prison, the district attorney's office said.
Appearing gaunt, Berndt entered the courtroom in an orange jail jumpsuit, handcuffed and chained at the waist.
In statements to the courts, the mothers told the judge that their daughters can never eat cookies again.
My daughter told me that the teacher would say the cookies had sugar and some white stuff that was on it," the mother said.
In September, the Los Angeles Unifed School District announced it paid almost $27.3 million to settle 58 of 191 students' lawsuits alleging they were victims of sexually lewd acts by Berndt.
