In Europe's capitals, as in many places, there was something of a gulp when the Nobel Peace Prize was announced, a feeling that it was being bestowed in hope of what was to come rather than in recognition of what had been achieved.
That said, Obama remains far more popular personally than Bush, whose Iraq war adventure with the eager assistance of British Prime Minister Tony Blair led to splits among Europe's leaders.
After the strong influence the climate change deniers appeared to have with the previous administration, Europeans were especially pleased that Obama said he would come to the climate summit in Copenhagen, Denmark.
On Afghanistan, Europe's political leaders were muttering behind the scenes as the president took a long time making up his mind about the extra troops.
He wanted to tell the folks back home in Peoria, Illinois, that the troops would be home in 18 months, and he wanted to tell the Taliban that an extra 30,000 troops were on their way to make life tough for them.
The Europeans, while they like much about Obama's style, are growing just a little uneasy about how things will pan out under his presidency.
"It's early days, but perhaps a little less talk and a little more do might be welcome," one former Downing Street insider told me.
They may become a little sensitive as the president is seen to cozy up to the new players.
The U.S. may still have the military might.
And he will probably remain rather more popular in Europe than he is at home because it is in tackling the back-pocket issues with their own electorates -- like health care -- that most politicians make their enemies.
But so discredited did he become back home that he was forced to step down and hand over power to Gordon Brown.
