President Obama says the United States will overcome 
Obama focused on the three priorities of the budget he will present to Congress later this week: energy, health care and education.
The president touted the $787 billion stimulus plan he signed into law last week, saying it will invest in areas critical to the country's economic recovery.
Obama also pledged a "historic commitment" to health care and said the recovery plan could lead to a cure for cancer.
Obama also said his budget will pay for more soldiers and Marines, increase their pay and expand veterans health care and benefits.
