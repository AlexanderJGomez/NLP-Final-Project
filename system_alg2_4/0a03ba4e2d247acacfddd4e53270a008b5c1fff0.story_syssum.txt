London, England (CNN) -- Stepping on the London subway train five years ago, the thirtysomething marketing manager never imagined her morning commute might eventually lead to the Paralympic Games.
"I would love, absolutely love, to be part of the Paralympics in 2012," Wright told CNN affiliate ITN last month.
Four bombs were set off that day in July, on three subway trains and a bus.
The British Volleyball Federation announced her place on the team last month, and this week the team is competing at the 2010 Sitting Volleyball World Championships in the U.S. state of Oklahoma.
Some 640 athletes from 20 countries are taking part in the event, the biggest major international competition before London 2012, according to Lisa Wainwright, chief executive of Volleyball England, the sport's national governing body.
She was the last person pulled from the station that day, and Wright said she feels she's one of the lucky ones.
"There were 52 people that day who were definitely worse than me, 'cause I'm still here."
