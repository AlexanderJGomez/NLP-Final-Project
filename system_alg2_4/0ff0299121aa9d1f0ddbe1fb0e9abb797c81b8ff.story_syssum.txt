(CNN) -- How are fads started and spread?
Every second, millions of people across the world are sharing their thoughts in the form of 140-character messages using Twitter.
To demonstrate the unique power of Twitter data, our research group at Northeastern University and Harvard Medical School recently began a study to infer the mood of Twitter users in the United States from their public tweets.
Never before have academic researchers had access to this much real-time public information about what people are thinking and saying.
Our approach simply looks, for example, for occurrences of "happy" or "unhappy" words in tweets.
Because most users leave their tweets public, Twitter represents an unprecedented opportunity.
Unlike many existing tools, such as surveys and polls, researchers cannot ask a question of the Twitter users directly; instead, researchers must determine whether the question is one that the Twitter data can answer.
From a scientific standpoint, Twitter data can shed light on how information spreads through society.
This new kind of data presents new challenges, such as privacy, anonymity and legality, but developing a science around it has the potential to do enormous good.
