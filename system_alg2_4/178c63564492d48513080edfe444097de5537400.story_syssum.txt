The family of a man who picked up a BB gun for sale at an Ohio Walmart and was shot dead by police has filed a federal lawsuit, claiming that the corporation and police are responsible for his death.
Attorney Michael Wright said his legal team filed a federal civil lawsuit against two police officers; Beavercreek's police chief; the city of Beavercreek and its Police Department; and Walmart.
David M. Darkow and Officer Sean C. Williams, who is also "involved in the only other fatal police shooting in the history of the Beavercreek Police Department," according to the lawsuit.
Walmart spokesman Brian Nick expressed condolences to Crawford's family and to relatives of a mother who fled the scene of the police shooting with her daughter, had a heart attack and later died.
In September, an Ohio grand jury decided not to indict the police officers.
Despite that willingness for a federal investigation, the city of Beavercreek and its Police Department expressed confidence they will prevail in the latest litigation.
"Mr. Crawford never used, loaded or pointed the pellet rifle at anyone, was doing nothing improper or illegal, and never caused any harm or acted in a manner that would cause any reasonable person to believe that he may cause harm," the suit said.
When the two officers located Crawford, "he was talking on a cell phone held in his right hand, with no other customers in his vicinity, and with his left side and back visible to the two police officers.
The family alleges, among other things, that the police officers did not use due diligence to determine that Wright wasn't a threat; that the officers didn't give him enough time to put down the weapon; and that Walmart was negligent because the air rifle had been resting on a shelf, unpackaged and unsecured, for at least two days, the family's lawyers said Tuesday.
