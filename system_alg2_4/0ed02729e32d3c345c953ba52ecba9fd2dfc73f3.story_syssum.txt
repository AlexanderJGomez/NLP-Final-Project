Will the situation improve in 2013, or will the bloody stalemate continue?
CNN's Nic Robertson and Nick Paton Walsh, who have reported from inside Syria, analyze the conflict and what the future may hold.
...
It's beginning to nip around the capital, and I don't think any observer at this point thinks that the Assad government really has a chance in terms of retaining long-term power over the country.
So perhaps what we're seeing is the regime entering a new phase now where, rather than fight to hold on to everything, they're fighting to have a better negotiating position in the future.
...
I think it's going to be a much more watered-down version of that.
...
Robertson: The economy in Syria is completely destroyed, and it's going to take years to rebuild.
What we're going to see in 2013 are large numbers of displaced people, millions internally inside the country.
Paton Walsh: I think once the majority of the violence ends, once the nuts and bolts of the civil war are behind them, then food, utilities will come back reasonably quickly because of the nature of where Syria is and who it's bordered by.
... Any sort of sense of these opposition groups want to coalesce around democracy, those are not the indications we have at the moment.
Paton Walsh: I think, in many ways, the process of that is under way, with the U.S. trying to influence a government in exile (and) many opposition figures gathering in Doha or Turkey to try and work out how that government would look like.
And now you have a scenario where the West hasn't come to the aid of the Syrians, so people are deeply angry.
I don't think we're going to find friends quickly in Syria.
