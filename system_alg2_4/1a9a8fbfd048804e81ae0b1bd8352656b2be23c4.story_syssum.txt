With 56 million passengers passing through last year, it's the third busiest airport in Europe and claims to serve more international destinations than any other airport in the world.
He added: "We have four runways, we have two terminals, divided in different parts, so we have a lot of taxiing aircraft, which is very complex.
And a single A380 can require up to 1,200 in-flight meals -- prepped and cooked by the airport's chefs.
International chefs work around the clock to dish out an average of 100,000 meals a day -- enough to feed the population of a small city.
"The challenge is to make good food ... because if you fly the air is dry, and you can't taste the salt," he said.
There's just one chance to deliver good food on a plane."
