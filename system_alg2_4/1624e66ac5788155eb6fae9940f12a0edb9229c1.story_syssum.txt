(CNN) -- There has been a lot of talk by the right wing recently about the success of Hillary and Bill Clinton since they left the White House.
Americans know it because they know the Clintons.
Republicans want us to think, somehow, that Hillary Clinton has not been fighting for all of us for the past four decades.
In the '90s, Hillary helped create the State Children's Health Insurance Program and she helped expand Head Start for low-income working families and provide after-school opportunities for older children.
That's four decades' worth of work on behalf of the American people -- a record that should deflate any smoke and mirrors attack by the right wing.
While the right wing remains focused on making sure the top 1% of income earners can keep their Bush tax cuts, Hillary Clinton continues her work today to make sure that other people get the chance to live the American Dream that she has experienced.
Americans know -- hands down -- that Hillary Clinton will continue looking to the future, fighting for the middle class, and putting first the lives of all Americans.
