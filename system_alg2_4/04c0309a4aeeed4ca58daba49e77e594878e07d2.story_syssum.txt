(CNN) -- A typhoon that left at least 18 people dead and thousands displaced in the Philippines was expected to move offshore Wednesday afternoon, the state-run Philippines News Agency reported early Wednesday.
But storm alerts were also issued for more than 40 other areas, including Metro Manila, the state weather bureau Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said.
On Tuesday, weather officials said the storm was packing top winds of 140 kph (87 mph).
Several areas in Metro Manila and nearby provinces were without electricity as the powerful storm cut power and transmission lines.
Santa Ana said people in the capital remained calm as the rain kept coming down, although one part of eastern Manila had to be evacuated because of flooding.
Dacalanio said the winds had uprooted street lights and brought down trees and road signs, but that luckily there was no flooding near his home.
