Earlier this week, the city's Department of Public Health announced that 706 infants and 43 health care workers had been exposed to tuberculosis, commonly called TB, at Providence Memorial Hospital.
Any necessary follow-up care will be provided free of charge by the health department and the hospital.
Parents and other family members of the infants are not being told to get tested because they "are not considered exposed," health officials said in a statement.
"Once in the body, the bacteria usually lay dormant for months or years before they begin to grow and cause a case of active TB," the El Paso Department of Public Health said in a statement.
The Texas Department of State Health Services conducted an on-site investigation at Providence Memorial Hospital last week and cited the hospital "for deficiencies that represent immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety," said Carrie Williams, the department's director of media relations.
"Babies are more likely than older children and adults to develop life-threatening forms of TB."
There is one vaccine for TB -- Bacille Calmette-Guerin, known as BCG -- that is not widely used in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; it is given more often to children in countries where TB is common.
In October, health officials identified 140 infants who may have been exposed to tuberculosis in a similar incident at a hospital in Nevada.
