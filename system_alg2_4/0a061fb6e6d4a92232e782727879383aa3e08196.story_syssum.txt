(CNN) -- Egypt has agreed to allow two Iranian warships to cross through the Suez Canal in a move that puts the country's new military regime in a prickly position with its Israeli neighbor.
Before that, Egypt did not allow Israeli ships to sail through the canal.
Schenker said the Iranians had asked for a frigate -- the Alvand -- and a military supply ship -- the Kharg -- to cross into the Mediterranean.
It raises tension, particularly in this time of transition in Egypt," Schenker said.
Asked about Iran's assertion that the ships are going to Syria for training, State Department spokesman P.J.
Asked whether he was concerned about the ships' travel plans, he said, "It's not really about the ships.
The Israeli Defense Ministry said it was monitoring the movement of the Iranian ships and alerted its allies.
It connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea, allowing ships to navigate between Europe and Asia without having to go around Africa.
