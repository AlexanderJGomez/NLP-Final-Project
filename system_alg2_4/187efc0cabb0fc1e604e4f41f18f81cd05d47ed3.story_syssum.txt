Bowe Bergdahl, let's get these points out of the way: the case for leaving no soldier behind is a sound and important one — a way to keep faith with our troops.
No.
Yes, because the jury is most definitely out on that one.
"The point is, you have to get him home as a way to keep faith with our troops," says a former senior national security official.
Then you deal with him and the circumstances of his departure."
In a way, it's all surreal and hard to unspool.
"This (The Bergdahl swap) is tying up loose ends," says another former senior national security source.
That the President should have instead planned for a gradual withdrawal, depending on circumstances on the ground.
They're tweeting their joy about Bergdahl's release one minute, then un-tweeting it the next.
That's why the White House needs to make it clear why the swap was a matter so urgent that there wasn't enough time to notify the appropriate people, much less consult with them.
Was Bergdahl swap legal?
Because right now, it looks like the lack of consultation is about one thing: the knowledge that there would be pushback.
Guess it's too late for that now.
The backdrop to all of this is that the same questions that are now being raised publicly had been raised internally for years — about what a "fair" trade would include.
And as my national security source adds, "people opposed the deal because it wasn't great."
No one left behind.
Bergdahl gets to go home.
