District Court Judge Jackie Glass sentenced four O.J.
The four -- Charles Cashmore, Charles Erlich, Michael McClinton and Walter Alexander -- all turned on Simpson and cooperated in the case against him.
The four apologized to the state and the victims in the case before their sentences were read in court Tuesday.

He'll remain jailed while an appeal is pending.
