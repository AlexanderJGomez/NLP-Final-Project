Disturbing news from North Korea comes just as often as stories that make us laugh in disbelief.
Stories from refugees who have escaped from North Korea are a chilling reminder that the regime is not just a military threat, it is causing a terrible humanitarian crisis.
It is those random, capricious, frequently dangerous behaviors that allow fragile, brittle, bankrupt North Korea to force its dazzlingly successful neighbor, South Korea, to maintain a constant state of alert, to wonder if its capital city can survive an attack across a border that lies just 35 miles away.
It may also have launched a torpedo that same year which sank a South Korean navy ship, killing 46.
The news from North Korea can be so disconcerting that spoofs and rumors regularly make it into the news and social media as if they were fact.
And, why not?
North Korean government researchers announced their country is the second happiest in the world -- second only to China.
No official biography of the current Kim has been released, other than an account that says he was "born in heaven."
The authorities have created their own reality, brainwashed the population to keep the state functioning and the regime secure.
By firing missiles, threatening neighbors and acting erratically, North Korea portrays itself as mysterious and volatile, and even that perception magnifies its ability to create fear, adding to its power and helping keep the despotic regime in control.
