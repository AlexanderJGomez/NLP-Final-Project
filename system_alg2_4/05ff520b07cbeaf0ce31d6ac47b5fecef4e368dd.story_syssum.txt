For the third straight year, U.S. diplomats on Thursday joined envoys from several other nations in walking out during the Iranian president's address at the annual United Nations gathering in New York.
"We find what Ahmadinejad does and says when he comes to the United Nations absolutely odious, hateful, anti-Semitic, unacceptable, which is why the United States for three consecutive years -- including today -- have led a walkout of his speech," Rice told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday.
The next day, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the Iranian leader at the General Assembly.
The U.S. and other Western nations had long suspected that Iran had been pursuing nuclear weapons, but Iran said it seeks only a civilian nuclear energy program.
he said.
On Iraq, Ahmadinejad said the United States, whom he called "the occupiers," is "incapable of establishing security," and scores were dying daily as a result.
Ahmadinejad in 2005 told the General Assembly that Iran had a right to operate a nuclear energy program.
He said it was unfair that some nations were allowed to make nuclear fuel while others are condemned for it.
