(CNN) -- The last time Ben Affleck played a superhero, the world cried.
He recovered from that valley slowly but surely, and went on to direct and star in standouts like 2010's "The Town" and 2012's "Argo," the latter of which won an Oscar for best picture.
"Ben provides an interesting counter-balance to Henry (Cavill)'s Superman," Snyder said in a statement.
... (It's) better than Hollywood forcing another nondescript young hunk on us."
Affleck as Batman?
That idea is probably making several Bruce Wayne fans cringe as they hurry to sign a petition begging Warner Bros. to drop Affleck from the role.
