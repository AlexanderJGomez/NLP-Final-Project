(CNN)My son Jason Rezaian and his wife were taken at gunpoint from their apartment in Iran more than 200 days ago.
Yeganeh was released in early October, and through November she was permitted three phone calls and two visits each week.
We do not rape, we do not torture; we do not waterboard.
When I visited my son in Evin on Christmas Day, he told me: "I will be a model prisoner if I am granted my rights under Islamic law.
But while I sincerely appreciate Zarif's "humanitarian" efforts, as well as the orchestrating of Jason's one telephone call to me for Thanksgiving Day, the fact is that as a dual citizen and therefore Iranian mother, it is my right to visit my son in prison.
There are apparently three separate security apparatuses, and Jason seems now to have been handed off to a legal branch (the judiciary) that appears to be taking its time scheduling his trial.
Anyone with knowledge of Iran knows that nothing happens during the two weeks following Nowruz, a period when even newspapers don't publish, so it can only be assumed his trial date might not be set before April 6.
And it deeply pains him to know that this situation has come about because of suspicions -- no matter how baseless -- about his contacts and associations.
It is traditionally a time when pardons are granted and prisoners are released on bail to visit with their families.
But our patience ran out some time ago, and it is difficult, nearly impossible, to maintain respect for a system under which someone who was born and raised American is being detained "as an Iranian" even as his rights under Iran's own laws are being so flagrantly violated.
Please review the evidence and release my son or ensure that he receives a fair trial immediately.
