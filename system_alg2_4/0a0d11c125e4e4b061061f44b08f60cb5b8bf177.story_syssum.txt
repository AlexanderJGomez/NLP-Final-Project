All white men.
All men.
Some facts: Women make up 6% of chief executives at the leading 100 tech companies, and that has taken years to accomplish.
In the past five years, women and minorities have lost ground despite evidence strongly suggesting that gender parity and board diversity have positive effects on profitability.
The tech industry has a well-documented pipeline problem, one largely the result of gender stereotypes that reach into the educational system.
Despite investing in diversity programs, the management of tech firms is distinctly not diverse, and indeed the industry continues to "dazzle" with incidents in which men gleefully display their not even implicit biases.
Second, sexism is seamlessly coupled with the distribution of capital.
Venture capitalists are less likely to invest in startups if there are women involved in their management; investors actively reduce holdings in companies that appoint female directors.

As reported by the Federal Communications Commission, our media are almost entirely owned and managed by white men.
The ghettoized status of women and minorities in media and technology, coupled with the lack of venture capital investments, means that our attempts to express ourselves are limited, misrepresented and regularly repackaged to make what we say palatable to a sexist status quo.
"This to me is not a gender issue, it's an innovation issue," Twitter CEO Dick Costolo has explained.
Twitter is one part of a male dominated social structure, economy and culture, all of which rely on cradle-to-grave sexism to be profitable.
