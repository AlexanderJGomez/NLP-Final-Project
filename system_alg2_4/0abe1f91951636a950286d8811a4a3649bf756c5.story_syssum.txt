When Ted finally finished the story for his kids, they called him on it: His story wasn't all about how he met their mother (she was barely in the story), it was about how much he loved Robin.
Robin, of course, had long ago divorced Barney -- the first big shocker of the night.
And what about the mother, aka Tracy?
And if your eyes stayed dry through the entire episode, you're probably a stronger person than most viewers.
Can't stop thinking about it.
Do you wish Tracy had stayed alive and Ted didn't ultimately end up with Robin?
For that matter, what do you think about Barney and Robin splitting up?
