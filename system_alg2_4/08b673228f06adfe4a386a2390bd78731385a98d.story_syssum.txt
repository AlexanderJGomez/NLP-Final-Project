Duch ran a prison where people were tortured and killed under the Khmer Rouge.
Prosecutors contend Duch ran S-21, a prison that had been converted from a school.
Many of the victims were military officials or Communist Party members targeted for not going along with the philosophy of the ultra-Maoist Khmer Rouge movement, prosecutors said.
Three years, eight months and 20 days later, at least 1.7 million people -- nearly one-quarter of Cambodia's population -- were dead from execution, disease, starvation and overwork, according to the Documentation Center of Cambodia.
Duch is the first former Khmer Rouge leader to stand trial.
Even though Duch was not a senior leader with the movement, many Cambodians were relieved that one of the regime's former leaders was facing justice, said Youk Chhang, head of the Documentation Center of Cambodia.
Four of the regime's former leaders, also accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity, await trial before the tribunal.
"It's hard to control my feelings when I see this," he said, as he watched footage of the prison taken 30 years ago.
