(CNN) -- The leader of a shuttering Ohio coal mining operation on Friday blamed the Obama administration for the shutdown and for hurting the economy generally with he called a "war on coal," an assertion the White House pushed back on as false and misleading.
"There will be additional layoffs, not only at Murray Energy, but also throughout the United States coal industry due to Mr. Obama's 'war on coal' and the destruction that it has caused so many jobs and families in the Ohio Valley area and elsewhere," Murray said.
"The president has made clear that coal has an important role in our energy economy today, and it will in the future," Stevens said.
Yet Brandon Unklesbay, the manager of Southeastern Equipment in Brilliant, said he didn't believe the coal mining operations closure will negatively impact the area or its businesses.
