London (CNN) -- The maker of a fake bomb detector that investigators say put lives at risk was sentenced Thursday to 10 years in prison by a London court.
While specific cases of death or injury as a result of the use of the devices can't be proved, their sale was a "callous confidence trick," the judge said.
McCormick was the driving force and sole director of his company, ATSC, and with a small number of employees sold well over 7,000 devices to the Iraqi government and other international agencies for between $2,500 and $30,000 per unit, the judge said.
Police investigators believe it cost McCormick less than $60 to make each device.
McCormick was not responsible for any attacks, his lawyer said, and any number of devices could not protect the people of Iraq.
British police believe that McCormick paid off officials to buy the ADE 651 in bulk.
