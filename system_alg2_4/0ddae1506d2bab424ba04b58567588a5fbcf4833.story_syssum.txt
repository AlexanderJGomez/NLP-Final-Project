(CNN) -- Two Alaskan volcanoes that began minor eruptions weeks ago are showing their strongest seismic activity yet, emitting small amounts of lava and ash along with smoke plumes, the Alaska Volcano Observatory said Tuesday.
Some lava is flowing, and the volcano is spewing a cloud of steam and ash that has risen as high as 28,000 feet, said Schneider, at the observatory in Anchorage.
Veniaminof, about 60 miles from Pavlof, started showing activity in early June and began erupting June 13, Schneider said.
"So far there's been trace amounts of ash, so it's just a fine coating," he said.
