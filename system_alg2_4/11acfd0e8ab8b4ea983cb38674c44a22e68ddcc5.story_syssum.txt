(EW.com) -- Let me put my cards on the table.
Unfortunately, Gareth Edwards' "Godzilla" feels like two movies Scotch-taped together.
Only one of these movies is any good.
In movies like these, it's all about the slow tease and the big reveal.
When Godzilla first lumbers on screen to hunt the MUTOs and ''restore balance,'' he feels both nostalgically familiar and excitingly new.
Or as Watanabe's Dr. Serizawa says, ''Let them fight!''
