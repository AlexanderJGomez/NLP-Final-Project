(CNN) -- The Syrian government has been mounting a campaign to boost vaccination among children in Syria after at least 20 suspected cases of polio were reported -- from government and opposition sources -- near the eastern city of Deir Ezzor.
Initial symptoms can include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, neck stiffness, limb pain and, in a small number of cases, paralysis.
The director of the National Immunization Program at the Ministry of Health, Dr. Nidal Abu Rashid, said the campaign also seeks to prevent measles cases, according to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency.
WHO said last week that it had received the reports of a cluster of cases of acute flaccid paralysis, which is defined as sudden onset of weakness and floppiness in any part of a child's body or paralysis in any person in whom polio is suspected as the cause.
Aid workers cannot reach some 2.5 million people in the country, she added.
Jaafari said Damascus has extended visas to hundreds of people working for the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), which is led by Amos.
In Syria, opposition activists blamed the war for more than 100 deaths Friday in a series of incidents.
Amid accusations by government and opposition forces that each side has used chemical weapons, the Syrian government continued this week to comply with its agreement to rid the country of its stores of such arms, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said.
President Bashar al-Assad on Thursday thanked workers at the ministries of electricity and petroleum for restoring services a day after much of the country was plunged into darkness by what the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said was sabotage of a gas pipeline.
