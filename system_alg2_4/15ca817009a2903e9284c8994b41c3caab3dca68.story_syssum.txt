The Transportation Security Administration says the so-called backscatter scans, which emit a small amount of radiation, are safe.
"TSA takes many precautions to regularly verify that all machines are operating properly."
Anderson, and I don't want radiation if I can avoid it," he said.
Anderson, a top cancer hospital, opt out because he wanted to avoid radiation.
First, you have to make a bit of a spectacle of yourself by publicly asking for something different.
To get a little perspective, when I returned home I randomly asked doctors I respect what they do in the security line.
"The amount of radiation you get isn't worth worrying about."
The radiation you get from a backscatter imaging machine used at many airports is the same amount of radiation you get from sitting on an airplane for two minutes, according to research released this week by the University of California San Francisco.
Even so, Brenner (who's a physicist, not a medical doctor) still goes through the scanners at airports because even by his calculations the amount of radiation is still small.
"I do whatever I can to avoid the scanner," Dr. Len Lichtenfeld wrote to me in an e-mail.
Lichtenfeld says it doesn't necessarily give him great comfort that the TSA says the scans are safe.
"There is really no absolutely safe dose of radiation," says Kim, chair of the department of neurosurgery at the University of Texas Medical School.
Doctors exposed to radiation at work are particularly sensitive to this issue, as I learned when I got through security that day in the airport and chased after the doctor who'd opted out.
"If we can avoid a little radiation in exchange for the two extra minutes needed for a pat-down, then we will," he says.
