Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said a power outage put city schools, firehouses, police stations, City Hall and Wayne State University in the dark Tuesday morning.
Public schools dismissed students after the power went out.
The city website said 740 traffic signals were knocked out, but power was not lost for the 911 system.
As part of the process, the city is getting out of the business of running PLD and the utility corporation DTE Energy is taking over, Duggan said.
Just last Sunday, power went out during a professional hockey game at Joe Louis Arena.
This outage isn't believed to have affected residences, officials said.
"We are back at full power at Joe Louis Arena," he said.
