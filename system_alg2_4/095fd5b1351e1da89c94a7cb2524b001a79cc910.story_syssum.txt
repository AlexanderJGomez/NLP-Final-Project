Government spokesman Abdu Ganadi told CNN said Saleh's forces "are near victory."
A nearby resident said the fighting had subsided after midnight, however.
Saleh has ruled Yemen since 1978, and the nation has been a key U.S. ally in the battle against the al Qaeda terrorist network.
A fresh group of about 1,000 armed tribesmen were seen entering Sanaa early Thursday, Sanaa resident Nageeb Mujaili said.
"The reason the street fighting in Sanaa has gotten a lot more intense in the past several hours is because special forces are now involved," said the source, who asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the news media.
A security official at Sanaa International Airport said inbound and outbound flights were halted due because of security concerns over clashes near the airport.
