A 1972 proposal fell short of ratification by three states before its 1982 deadline.
The key Senate supporter, New Jersey Democrat Robert Menendez, said three-fourths of Americans assume the Equal Rights Amendment is already part of the Constitution -- but because the measure has never been ratified by the states, "the courts might not guarantee it," he said.
He said the justices "would elevate a corporate entity to have the rights of an individual, and yet say that women do not have rights as an individual under the Constitution.
It doesn't."
Lawmakers who passed the 1972 proposal extended a seven-year deadline to 1982, yet ratification stalled at 35 out of the needed 38 states.
The 27th Amendment blocks lawmakers from voting themselves a pay raise to take effect during the same session of Congress in which it was passed.
