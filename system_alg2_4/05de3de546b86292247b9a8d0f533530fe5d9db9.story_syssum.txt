A former member of FIFA's ethics committee, Les Murray, says a member of the world governing body's executive committee asked a member of the Australian bid team for the 2022 World Cup for a kickback in exchange for a vote.
The FIFA ethics committee was not dealing with the bid process at that time.
This person is a member of the Australian bid team," said the 69-year-old Murray, who is known as Australia's 'Mr.
"Matters related to the 2018/2022 enquiry are solely handled by the investigatory chamber of the independent FIFA Ethics Committee and as such we are not in position to make any comments," said FIFA in a statement.
"The idea of Les Murray being a 'whistle-blower' is interesting, but not one that's weighed down by evidence," Bonita Mersiades, former head of corporate affairs for the bid team, told CNN.
If Murray refused to name names surrounding the allegations of bribery, he was more forthcoming in his views on Qatar winning the right to host the 2022 World Cup.
Murray also believes that FIFA made a "big mistake" by allowing the World Cup to go to Qatar citing the nation's human rights records as one area of concern.
That decision was also met with criticism by human rights groups who are unhappy at the Gulf State's treatment of migrant workers.
"We are also working on laws to cover domestic workers," the statement added.
