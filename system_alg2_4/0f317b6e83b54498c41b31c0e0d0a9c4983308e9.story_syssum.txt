(CNN) -- A flood of details has emerged in the past 24 hours about the case of Ariel Castro and the three women police say he held for close to a decade inside his modest Cleveland home.
And if not, how could that be?
It seems implausible -- three women, and later a child, held captive for close to a decade within a 1,400-square-foot home in a densely populated urban neighborhood without anyone else knowing.
And when Castro and Grimilda Figueroa moved to the house on Seymour Avenue -- where the women were later discovered -- Castro wouldn't even let family members through the front door.
"Ariel kept everybody at a distance," said Cleveland Deputy Police Chief Ed Tomba.
But in her initial interview Monday with police, Knight told investigators that she had suffered at least five miscarriages, according to the incident report obtained by CNN.
Authorities haven't concluded who, if anyone, should get the money, but are discussing it, Tomba said.
A lot of credit and he is the true key to this case," Tomba said.
