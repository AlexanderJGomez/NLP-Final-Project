A 17-year-old male was charged Saturday as an adult with aggravated assault and other charges over a shooting the previous day at a Philadelphia high school, police said.
Detective Don Suchinsky said Saturday that a second male held for questioning was released to his mother.
The shooter was in the school gym with about seven other students, city police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said.
They were taken to a local hospital, police said, and their wounds are not life-threatening.
The shooter had left the scene.
They later released the 15-year-old male, who was "completely cleared by investigators," Stanford said.
But police do not know how many shots were fired, Ramsey said.
"These kind of things just absolutely should not happen."
