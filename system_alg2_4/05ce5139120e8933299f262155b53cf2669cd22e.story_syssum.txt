That is wrong.
Democrat Harry Reid, majority leader of the Senate?
But generations of Senate leaders from Henry Clay to Bill Frist have felt compelled to seek changes in Senate rules to make the chamber a more governable place.
Twice this week, the Senate has opened debate with its party leaders engaged in a caustic battle over Reid's plans to seek changes to Senate rules in January.
Reform of the Senate is overdue.
A top priority should be to eliminate filibusters of the "motion to proceed" to a bill and the three motions that are required to send a bill to conference with the House.
Banning the filibuster on this motion would still allow a minority to filibuster the underlying bill and amendments to it.
The first cloture vote would require 60 votes, as is required under Senate rules.
Coupling new cloture thresholds and notice requirements would allow the Senate to reach votes by simple majority while still protecting the minority's parliamentary rights.
The Senate should consider new "fast-track" confirmation rules.
Zelizer: Gridlock in Congress?
That is the unfortunate history of Senate reform: Senators rarely want to give up their parliamentary advantages.
Because changes to Senate rules can be filibustered, efforts to reform the Senate typically crash and burn.
