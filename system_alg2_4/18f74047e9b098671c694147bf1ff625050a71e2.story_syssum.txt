The ruling GPC party said the president will be received by celebrations, but anti-government demonstrators throughout the country likely would not welcome his return.
"Saleh's arrival back to Yemen is not a surprise; we said all along that he is traveling for medical treatment and, like any other president in the world, is expected to be back to his country and continue with the role of leadership," said Yasser Al-Yamani, a senior Saleh aide.
Saleh will return strong and the will of the people will stand against any other will," he said.
In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said at the briefing Tuesday that she was not aware of reports that Saleh planned to return to Yemen Friday.
Government forces have been locked in conflict with al Qaeda's Yemen wing, and authorities fear the group, called al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, is exploiting the political instability.
