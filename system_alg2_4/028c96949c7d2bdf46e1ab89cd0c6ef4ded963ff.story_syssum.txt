Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius is a heartbroken man who has to live with the fact that he killed the love of his life, his uncle has told CNN in an exclusive interview.
Arnold Pistorius described the runner's grief as "unthinkable" and says his heart bleeds for his nephew.
Pistorius says Steenkamp's death was an accident and that he mistook her for a burglar.
The state says it was murder.
And just had this voice of a girl frantically on the other side shouting, 'Please, you have to rush over here, you have to come to Oscar's house,'" Peet van Zyl told CNN in an exclusive interview.
Reeva's been shot.'
Van Zyl said he then called Ampie Louw, the sprinter's coach, and told him to jump in his car and get to Pistorius's house.
Pistorius will make a brief appearance Tuesday at the Pretoria Magistrates Court, which will hear a motion by state prosecutors to postpone the case for further investigations.
