(CNN) -- Somalia, Myanmar and Afghanistan have the lowest scores on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, which measures how people in 178 countries and territories view corruption in their public sectors.
The United States, with a score of 7.1, is among the countries viewed as least corrupt.
Transparency International is a nongovernmental organization headquartered in Berlin.
The country scored a 3.3 on the most recent index, putting it among the countries viewed as most corrupt.
Again, it's important to point out that these surveys were conducted well before these two countries' longtime leaders were ousted.
