It was a heady time filled with parties and recording sessions and only one person was there to capture it all intimately -- famed music photographer Jim Marshall, who was covering the tour for Life magazine.
Now the estate of Marshall is releasing some of the never-before-seen photos of the band in a new book "The Rolling Stones 1972" (Chronicle Books), out on August 15.
Davis told CNN that what made Marshall's shots unique was that he always demanded total access to the rock stars.
"He really was everywhere with the musicians on the tour bus or offstage," Davis said.
Marshall's ability to camouflage without disturbing the band's dynamic also allowed him to experience the touring life of the Rolling Stones, Davis said.
Davis said that Marshall's strong personality, fierce passion for music and his drive to get the best pictures while maintaining a sense of camaraderie made him relatable to musicians such as Richards.
As Keith said in the foreword of the book, on the tour he was like another Rolling Stone."
"Mick was very business-oriented," Davis said.
"Jim was always trying to show the true face of whatever he photographed," Davis said.
He said, 'I was a historian with a camera and I didn't know it.'
