The Braley campaign confirms the first lady's plans to come to Iowa next month, though no dates, events or locations have yet been set.
Braley is campaigning against Republican state Sen. Joni Ernst, an Iraq War veteran who beat a large primary field earlier this year with popular ads (including one about castrating pigs) and endorsements by many well-known Republicans, including Mitt Romney, Sen. Marco Rubio and Sarah Palin.
Other popular Democrats will appear in Iowa this weekend as well.
Braley will also be though, though neither of the Clinton's have plans to stump specifically for him.
