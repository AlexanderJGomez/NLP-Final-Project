Erin Sheehan played dead while the Virginia Tech shooter went on a rampage.
Sheehan was only one of four students in the room not to get shot.
"I tried to use a podium at the front of the classroom to block the door, because the gunman was shoving at the door and started firing through the door.
Like so many on campus, April 16, 2007, marks the worst day of her life, when Cho killed 32 students and professors in the deadliest school shooting in U.S. history.
Sheehan recently accompanied CNN to what is known as the Virginia Tech April 16, 2007 Prevail Archive -- an office space on the edge of campus where mementoes sent from across the world are temporarily warehoused.
Thousands of other letters are also kept in the archive.
Walking through the archive for the first time, Sheehan was overcome with emotion.

"People at other places have really identified with us and felt all of this with us," she said.
And when you find those letters, they stay with you -- all day, all week," said Amy Vilelle, the manuscript archivist.
Some are very personal, like a pair of goggles from a lab partner.

"I still have trouble sleeping some days," Sheehan said.
"It really does bother me because I still understand I could have been killed so easy, and there is no explanation why I wasn't."
