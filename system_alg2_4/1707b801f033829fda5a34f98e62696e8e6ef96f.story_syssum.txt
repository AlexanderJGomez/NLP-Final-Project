Pedro Zapeta was "very, very happy" when he learned about a federal appeals court ruling that says he is entitled to recover some of the money, said attorney Robert Gershman, who handled the financial end of Zapeta's case.
He told authorities he was returning home to Guatemala with the money he had saved working illegally as a dishwasher over 11 years.
The appeals court ordered a hearing to set a new fine.
"The government always acted as if the money was their own," Gershman said.
But it's not their money.
As Zapeta's case was publicized, U.S. residents donated money to him, and Gershman set up a trust.
