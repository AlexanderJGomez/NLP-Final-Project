The ruling that Kerviel must pay â‚¬4.9 billion (about $6.3 billion) in damages to the bank, Societe Generale, was also upheld.
"We had set ourselves the objective of defending Mr. Kerviel against an injustice that is absolutely lamentable," Koubbi said outside the courthouse, according to CNN affiliate BFM-TV.
If Kerviel's conviction were overturned, it could once more raise questions about the bank's role in the scandal.
Metzner filed the appeal against the sentence, but Kerviel switched to Koubbi as his attorney in March this year.
Koubbi lamented that "despite the new elements added to his defense," Kerviel's appeal had failed.
