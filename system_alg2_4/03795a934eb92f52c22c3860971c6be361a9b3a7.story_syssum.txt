Alonso, 29, admitted he made a bad start in the year's third grand prix but maintained race strategy was not the reason behind Ferrari's low-scoring performance.
"I made a bad start, Felipe Massa [Alonso's teammate] managed to get past me and a Force India nearly did the same, then it was a good battle on the opening lap.
We know we have to improve to get to the front.
I expect our engineers to act with determination and know-how, unleashing the maximum of their capacity to improve the performance of the car in a short time.
Probably we would have finished on the podium, but we need to look into all the details with the engineers."
Ferrari's decision making hit the headlines at the end of the 2010 season when an error in race strategy cost Alonso a third world title at the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
