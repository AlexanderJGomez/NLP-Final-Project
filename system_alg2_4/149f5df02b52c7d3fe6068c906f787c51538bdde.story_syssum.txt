(CNN)It's an unseasonably warm day in Oakland, California, a perfect morning for Jennifer and Dave Simon to take their baby, Livia, out for a walk.
Two days later, the doctor's office called to say that a child with measles had been in the office that same day.
Then the Simons learned from a doctor that the child in the doctor's office had contracted measles because his parents had refused vaccination.
"I'm angry," Simon said.
"Their choice endangered my child," she said.
When asked what she would say to parents of the unvaccinated child, she said she would first ask whether their child was doing OK.
