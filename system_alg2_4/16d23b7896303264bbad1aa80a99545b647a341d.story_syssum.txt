Every girl should have the right to that life, but there are millions of girls in my country who are not so fortunate and are subjected to child marriage.
Every child dreams of a brighter future and a better world, but the question is, why does this dream become a nightmare in the lives of so many girls?
The law in Bangladesh says no girl should get married before 18 years of age and no boy before 21 years of age.
For the past three years I have lost at least two friends to early marriages at an age where I didn't even know what marriage was.
That is how parents treat their daughters â€” like dolls who have no voice.
If a girl can feed her family, it will help parents rethink the idea that their daughters are a burden.
If we stop this problem, other problems in our country will be reduced automatically.

My grandmother got married when she was 9 and my mother got married when she was 16.
My hope is that my friends in Bangladesh and girls around the world will get to chase their dreams, too.
