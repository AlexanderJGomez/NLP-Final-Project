Paipote, Chile (CNN) -- In short order, freed miner Victor Antonio Segovia dispatches with some of the myths swirling around the 33 men rescued from the depths of the earth this week: He has no plans to write a book about what he endured in the San Jose mine, he isn't going to sue anyone for the collapse, and he intends to go back to working in the area's mines.
"Welcome home Victor Segovia," one neighbor said as she carried a handwritten sign greeting the miner into his home.
While Victor's brother Pedro Segovia waits under the scorching sun of Chile's Atacama desert, he nervously toys with a brand new Sony media player.
"We missed him a lot," Pedro Segovia said.
"He'll tell me at some point," Pedro Segovia said.
Two Chilean flags decorate a wall in a courtyard behind the Segovia's home.
But for the guest of honor just getting to the party will be almost as difficult as the previous legs of his journey.
It has all the makings of an ugly media scene.
As the party gets under way, though, clapping and joyous chants of "Chi Chi Chi, Le Le Le, los mineros de Chile," can be heard from outside the house.
As reporters ask him questions, he looks down.
"That was quite something," he said simply of the August 5 mine collapse.
Segovia said he missed his family terribly while in the mine.
So much time together, like any family, the problems start but were ones we worked out."
"Here you have nightmares until you realize you are out."
