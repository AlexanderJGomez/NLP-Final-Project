(CNN) -- Pakistan cricket legend Imran Khan has described how the unfolding crisis in Haiti revived harrowing memories of a similar earthquake in his own region.
Just watching human suffering, he said.
"Families were torn apart as parents lost their children and children were orphaned.
So many people needing help at one time and you don't have the infrastructure, you don't have the hospitals to help."
The destruction of Balakot brought home to Khan how much people had lost.
While acknowledging the importance of the international aid effort, Khan pointed to role ordinary Pakistanis played in 2005.
"I was in an earthquake-hit area on the second day and I'll never forget seeing a three-mile queue of people trying to get to what was a largely remote area to help with whatever they could put in their cars.
"Everyone took responsibility," recalled Khan.
