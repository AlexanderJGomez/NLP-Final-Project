The company are developing an autonomous rear wing that self-transforms according to the conditions.
"Any place that uses robotics today, you could use materials and have the same capabilities," says Skylar Tibbits, a computational architect who leads the Lab and the movement.
The self-assembly process has been described as 4D printing.
The materials are 3D-printed into specific shapes and then autonomously transform into another, with wide-ranging implications for industry from automotive to medical to military.
Wood and carbon fibers are responding well, but "can we do it with everyday materials, with repeatability?
In addition to BAC, the team are collaborating with Airbus to develop the wing design.
Fashion and furniture are also targets -- making the self-lacing sneakers of 'Back to the Future' a possibility at last.
Demand for 4D is reaching a fever pitch, says Dr. Junus Kahn, founder of Carbitex, which produces the materials used by the Self-Assembly Lab, as well as supplying them to major business clients.
"Everyone is always scared that technology will take our jobs," says Tibbits, rolling his eyes.
If the full scale of his vision is realized, we might need to do little else.
