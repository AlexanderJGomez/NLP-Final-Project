The action film debuted higher than franchise launchpad "The Bourne Identity," which grossed $27.1 million in its 2002 opening weekend, but it will need solid word of mouth (which may not be merited by its lukewarm "B" CinemaScore grade) to match that film's $121.7 million finish.
"The Bourne Supremacy" started with $52.5 million on the way to $176.2 million, and 2007′s "The Bourne Ultimatum" started with $69.3 million en route to a $227.5 million finish.
Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis' election comedy "The Campaign" took second place with $27.4 million.
The highest grossing political comedy in recent memory is actually Sacha Baron Cohen's "The Dictator," which was widely perceived as a misfire when it earned $59.7 million against a rumored $100-plus million budget and massive advertising campaign.
After four frames, Christopher Nolan's $250 million Batman finale has soared to $390.1 million, and it will pass "The Hunger Games' " $407.3 million cume to become 2012′s second-highest-grossing domestic performer next weekend.
After five days, the film, which was issued a "B" CinemaScore grade, has earned $20.1 million.
Its predecessor, "Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules," had earned $38.2 million at the same point in its run, but that film started with $23.7 million, while "Dog Days" started with just $14.6 million — a difference of $9.1 million.
