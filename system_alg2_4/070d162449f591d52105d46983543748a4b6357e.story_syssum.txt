Nude photographs of Pakistani actress Veena Malik, published in the December issue of the Indian edition of the men's magazine FHM prompted Malik to threaten a lawsuit.
Malik, editor Kabeer Sharma said, posed nude.
Bilawala said the publication "cheated" his client and doctored the nude pictures.
FHM, Bilawala said, violated its agreement with the Pakistani model that stipulated that Malik would be shown the photos from the shoot before they were published.
Malik said she never agreed to pose nude, the prospect of which sparked outrage in her homeland.
But I didn't agree to this and they are wrong.
Asif was found guilty last month in an English court.
Still, she downplayed her criticism back home.
