To be fair, Psaki described the U.S. peace talks with the Taliban -- which Afghan President Hamid Karzai opposes -- as the preliminary step toward long healing process in war-torn Afghanistan and creating "reconciliation" within the country.
"The important thing here is that we've long said that moving toward a reconciliation process, of which they are a key part -- the president has said this, the secretary (of state) has said this -- is an important part of moving towards a more stable Afghanistan.
The Taliban announcement has angered the Afghan president, who said the country's High Peace Council won't take part in peace talks in Qatar until the process is led by Afghans.
Karzai was referring to how, during Tuesday's ribbon-cutting in Qatar, a Taliban spokesman said the group would continue its military campaign while at the same time renouncing international terrorism.
"We've long said that this conflict will likely not be won on the battlefield, and that is why we support this office," Psaki said.
The ability to open a formal line of communication with the Taliban is important to reaching an "end goal" of disassociating the Taliban from al Qaeda and bringing peace to Afghanistan, Psaki said.
This is a first step in the process.
"This is just the first step in the process.
Gen. John Allen, the former commander of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, recommended a level between 6,000 and 15,000 troops, but the Pentagon has cut the proposed figure further, to between 2,500 and 9,000, according to a defense official.
