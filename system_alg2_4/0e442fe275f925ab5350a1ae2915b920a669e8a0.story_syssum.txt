Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- The Japanese government stepped in Monday to weaken the yen, after it climbed to a post-World War II high against the dollar.
"I decided it (the intervention) this morning as I cannot tolerate such appreciation."
The government is worried that a strengthened yen will impact its economy, which relies heavily on exports.
"The question is how long will the effect of the intervention continue," said Toshihiko Matsuno, a senior strategist of SMBC Friend Securities.
It's a battle between the market and the government."
