(CNN) -- The news that NBC plans to dump Jay Leno -- again -- lifts the curtain on a dark corner of the media business.
Leno has the top-rated show at 11:30.
What??
Time to wheel the old guy off the stage.
Jay hasn't been funny since the Clinton administration and Fallon appeals to a younger crowd.
Does the 62-year-old comic skew old?
The critics made the same mistake last time around.
One strange twist is that some conservative pundits are carping that NBC is ousting Leno because of his jokes about President Obama (he ribs every president) and because, unlike the more openly liberal Letterman, he appeals to the heartland.
But in their haste, NBC execs risk blowing up the situation the way they did in hustling Ann Curry off the "Today" show, sparking a backlash against Matt Lauer and sending what had been the iconic morning show plunging into second place.
1?
The critics, of course, won't be happy until Leno is working the comedy clubs where he spends his vacations (and possibly competing against NBC from Fox).
