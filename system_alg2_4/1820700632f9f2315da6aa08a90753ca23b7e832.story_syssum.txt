Los Angeles (CNN) -- Legendary fitness pioneer Jack LaLanne saved millions of lives by teaching people to eat right and exercise regularly, Arnold Schwarzenegger said in his eulogy for LaLanne on Tuesday.
"It doesn't matter where you go, there is a health club and it all started with Jack LaLanne," Schwarzenegger, the bodybuilder, actor and former California governor, said.
He had self-esteem.
"Jack is now in heaven and, of course, that's going to be very annoying for a lot of people up there," Schwarzenegger said.
People doubted what LaLanne was promoting in his early years, he said.
They warned "you could get heart problems, become a narcissist, turn gay, or it could reduce your sex drive," Schwarzenegger said.
Schwarzenegger said he first met LaLanne soon after he moved to Venice Beach, California, as a young bodybuilder.
"I said, 'This guy is a machine, he's the real machine,'" he said.
