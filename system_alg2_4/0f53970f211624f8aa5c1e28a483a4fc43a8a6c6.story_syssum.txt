(CNN)Two Los Angeles police officers were shot at Sunday night while they drove their patrol car in the southern part of the city, police said.
LAPD Detective Megan Aguilar told CNN that investigators have "nothing to indicate that there's a nexus" between the shooting and recent nationwide protests against police brutality that have fueled animosity toward police.
Someone fired three bullets at two deputies with the Pasco County Sheriff's Office as they sat in their patrol car.
The latest incidents of shots fired at police come after New York police Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were gunned down in their patrol car on December 20.
On Saturday, more than 25,000 police officers from across the country and even Canada attended Ramos' funeral.
