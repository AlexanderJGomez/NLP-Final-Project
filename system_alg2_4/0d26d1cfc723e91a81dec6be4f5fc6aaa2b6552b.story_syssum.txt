After inpatient rehab, Felicia Anderson sought help from Mothers Making a Change to help beat her addiction.
In that moment, Anderson vowed to stay off drugs, something she'd been unable to do in more than a decade addicted to crack cocaine, even when she was pregnant with her first two children.
Anderson was both.
"I can say with everything in me, with every bit of my breath, that program helped me turn my life around," said Anderson, who now runs a program to help the developmentally disabled in DeKalb County, Georgia.
Among them: Admit you're powerless over your addiction, and turn your life over to a higher power.
Anderson began drinking and smoking marijuana in high school.
She said the crack numbed her pain.
And she began stealing to keep her children clothed and fed and to support her habit.
The crack was my job.
Anderson said she even smoked crack as she went into labor with her second child.
He convinced the judge to let Anderson and her two daughters come to Georgia with him and to let his sister check into rehab instead of going to jail.
And laying there at that moment, I did say to myself, 'I can do this.
Anderson said that she has been drug-free for 12 years and that she's lucky: Her older two children did not suffer any health consequences from her addiction.
Anderson now has everything she had lost for a big part of her adult life: a stable home life, a job.
