Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- A Georgia Capitol police corporal was grazed by a bullet Wednesday afternoon during an exchange of gunfire with a man suspected of being part of a chop shop ring, authorities said.
The two officers approached one of the suspects shortly before 2 p.m. at an alleyway.
The injured suspect was taken to the same hospital and underwent surgery, Bankhead said.
One of the suspects has an uspecified outstanding warrant in Fayette County, south of Atlanta, the GBI said.
