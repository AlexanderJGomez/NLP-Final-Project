Washington (CNN) -- A typo kept President Barack Obama from signing legislation designed to end budget-related FAA air traffic controller furloughs blamed for widespread flight delays, a congressional source told CNN.
The FAA "is not impacted," the source said.
Since Sunday, more than 3,000 flights had been delayed because of the furloughs, the FAA said.
The furloughs affected some 15,000 FAA air traffic controllers.
