Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The U.S. Defense Department on Monday identified the SEAL killed during a successful raid to free a captive doctor in Afghanistan.
Armed men kidnapped Joseph and two other staff members for the international aid group Morning Star on Wednesday as they returned from a rural medical clinic in eastern Kabul province.
Morning Star said negotiations began "almost immediately" with the captors and went on sporadically into Saturday night, when two of the three were released.
The Afghan doctor's family paid $12,000 to the smugglers, Haqbeen and Samad said.
His former high school superiors and classmates at Norwin High School in North Huntington, Pennsylvania, remembered him as diligent and enthused about joining the military.
Former classmate Stefanie Stewart told CNN she sat next to Checque on the school bus almost every day.
The rescued doctor has worked with Morning Star for three years.
Morning Star did not release the identities of the other two men, citing safety concerns.
Despite the kidnappings of Joseph and its two other staffers, Morning Star reiterated its "commitment to continue its work" in Afghanistan.
