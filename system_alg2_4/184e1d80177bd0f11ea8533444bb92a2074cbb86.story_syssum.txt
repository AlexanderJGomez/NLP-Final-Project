A separate explosion happened outside the Russian Embassy, police said.
The third parcel was addressed to the German Embassy, but it was detonated near a courier office because embassy officials thought it might be a parcel bomb and sent it back, police said.
Monday, a parcel bomb addressed to the Mexican Embassy exploded at the same private courier company and wounded a woman there.
The arrested men are in their early 20s and are both Greek nationals, police said.
It was addressed to the Dutch Embassy.
