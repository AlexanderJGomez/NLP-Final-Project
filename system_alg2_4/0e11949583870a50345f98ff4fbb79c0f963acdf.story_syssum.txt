(CNN) -- Former Baltimore Orioles "Iron man" Cal Ripken Jr. said Friday that his 74-year-old mother is doing well after being abducted by a gunman last week, but he thinks the kidnapping might have been premeditated.
Police in Aberdeen, Maryland, said a man with a gun showed up at her home between 7 and 8 a.m. Tuesday, and then forced her into her vehicle and drove off.
Aberdeen authorities say they are still looking for motives in the case and haven't found evidence of ransom demands for the elder Ripken.
"At this time I can say we know of no ransom demand," Police Chief Henry Trabert told reporters last week.
Authorities are currently trying to enhance video of surveillance footage from a nearby store, the source said.
