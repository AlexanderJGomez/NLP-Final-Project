(CNN) -- The Australian radio station which made a prank call to a UK hospital that apparently resulted in the death of a nurse said Tuesday that it would donate at least 500,000 Australian dollars (US$524,000) to a fund for the nurse's family.
Saldanha put through a call from the DJs to a nurse on the ward at King Edward VII's Hospital, where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for acute morning sickness early last Tuesday.
The hospital has said that it is also collecting donations from the public for the family and asked that checks be made out to King Edward VII's Hospital -- Jacintha Saldanha Memorial Fund and mailed to Finance, King Edward VII's Hospital, 10 Beaumont Street, London.
There has been a fierce public backlash against the radio station, both within Australia and worldwide, since its decision to broadcast the pre-recorded prank call.
They also stressed Monday that while they made the call to the hospital, they did not have a say on whether it went to air.
It was the first full-year earnings report since Southern Cross Media and Austereo Group merged in May 2011.
London's Metropolitan Police have contacted Australian authorities in relation to the call, but "are not discussing about what or with who" they're talking, a spokesman told CNN.
