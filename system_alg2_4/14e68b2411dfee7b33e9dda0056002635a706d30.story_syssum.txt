(CNN) -- How much is playing the same video game for a month worth?
The four finalists all threw perfect games in "MLB 2K13" during the qualifying month, but Chavarria and the other three were the most perfect.
Chavarria got his perfect game with pitcher Kevin Slowey of the light-hitting Miami Marlins.
Chavarria, who was a pitcher in high school and for one year in college, said having a pitcher's mentality helped him devise a game plan against the batters.
"It is a video game, so you don't have to be a star athlete or a pitcher in the MLB.
Holland used the Oakland A's in his attempt to win the prize, but Chavarria's Rangers were too much.
Chavarria added another home run later in the game, and his pitching kept Holland's A's off balance as he won 3-1.
"Just keep playing.
You just never know."
