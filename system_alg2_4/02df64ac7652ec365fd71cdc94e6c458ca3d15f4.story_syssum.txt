The 45-year-old Gotbaum accidentally strangled herself while in police custody after behaving erratically in a terminal at Phoenix's Sky Harbor airport when she missed her connecting flight, according to both family and police accounts.
They accused the city and its police department of negligence in leaving Gotbaum chained and unattended in an airport police cell.
She grew incensed, threw her phone and started running down the concourse yelling, "I am not a terrorist," according to witness accounts.
But Gotbaum's husband, Noah, filed suit claiming the officers were negligent in leaving her unattended in a disoriented state.
