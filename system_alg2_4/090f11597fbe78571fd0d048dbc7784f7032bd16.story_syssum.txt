(CNN) -- As nearly 600 days under siege sap the life and dignity out of the Old District in the Syrian city of Homs -- leaving malnourished men with legs like noodles and soot-stained children to dig through homes turned into rubble for bits of firewood -- diplomats in a picturesque Swiss city bicker over aid.
Milk for children, there is none.

''We ask Geneva to break the siege and make us safe roads and get us out of here.
... We have been around one year and eight months under the siege, and also we don't want Ban Ki-moon ... to be worried about us anymore.
"The regime is blocking all convoys of aid to Homs, and has been doing so for months.

Doctors tell CNN that without intervention from the international community, "more people will die."
This situation reflects poorly on the international community to help these besieged areas," Ramez said.
