A new report, released Wednesday by the Environmental Working Group, finds that no one bug repellent works against every insect, but your best bets are those products made with active ingredients registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Despite DEET's reputation as a harmful substance, the EWG researchers found it to be one of the most effective chemicals against the risks of West Nile virus and Lyme disease.
The West Nile virus, which is carried by mosquitoes, infected more than 5,600 Americans last year, and 286 people died from the virus, according to the CDC.
The virus migrates around the country, so health officials say it's very important to be aware if your area is being affected.
"You need to know the insects that exist where you live and what works best against them," Andrews said.
For instance DEET, when used correctly, is an excellent repellent, but overuse has been found to cause neurological problems in some people.
Health experts suggest sticking with a 30% concentration, a number that can be found on the repellent's label.
The EWG also notes that repellents should be a last resort when warding off insects.
These products are out there, they are safe, and people should be using them to protect themselves."
