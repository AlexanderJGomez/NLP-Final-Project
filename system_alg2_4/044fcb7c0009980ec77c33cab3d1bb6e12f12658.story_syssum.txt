How could I write something useful for women in China?
I've developed a burning passion for empowering Chinese women, and I now work full-time in China's booming fashion and lifestyle media.
Many Chinese women now are well-educated -- in fact, Businessweek reported that U.S. business school enrollment is driven by women from China.
In short, Chinese women today want what all women want -- great careers, true love, and maybe, a child who's happy and successful (most Chinese women are still restricted to having one child under government policy).
The current generation of women is caught in a transitional moment in Chinese history.
Now, there is an epic clash unfolding in Chinese society between women's newfound dreams and traditional notions of a woman's role.
But in a culture where women always have been second-class, laws will change only when enough women recognize their own selves and say "I'm not gonna take it anymore!"
Naomi Wolf wrote in "The Beauty Myth" that American women's magazines were the "first messengers in history to address the majority of women...to tell them they have a right to define themselves first."
We're all making culture now.
