Mariupol, Ukraine (CNN) -- A U.S. lawmaker is calling for the arming of Ukrainian forces engaged in fighting Russian troops along the nation's eastern border with Russia.
"And we must recognize it as that," said Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Poroshenko said thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukrainian territory.
European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, speaking at a meeting in Brussels, said new sanctions are in the works for Russia.
"I want to remind you that Russia is one of the most powerful nuclear nations," Putin said.
The Ukrainian military worked to fortify the port city of Mariupol after Russian intelligence groups were observed there, said Col. Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Defense and Security Council.
Since mid-April, the conflict between the pro-Russia rebels and the Ukrainian military has cost more than 2,500 lives, according to the United Nations.
