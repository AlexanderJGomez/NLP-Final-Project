A judge who investigated the Gran Rex theater said the bomb was set to be detonated around 4:30 p.m. Wednesday afternoon, when former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe is scheduled to speak.
A theater employee alerted authorities after finding the device, Oyarbide said.
Colombia's defense minister condemned the apparent attack attempt and called for an investigation.
Uribe is scheduled to speak on at an international entrepreneurs conference Wednesday at the Gran Rex, one of the largest theaters in Buenos Aires.
