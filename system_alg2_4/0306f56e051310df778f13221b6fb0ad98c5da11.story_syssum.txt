The American Red Cross is providing food, shelter and relief supplies to thousands of people forced from their homes.
To make a monetary donation, visit the Colorado chapter website or you can text REDCROSS to 90999 to give $10 to American Red Cross Disaster Relief.
To help with their efforts, visit www.imsalvationarmy.org or call 1-800-SAL-ARMY (1-800-725-2769) and designate "Colorado Floods."
Save the Children is also a partner of the Red Cross in opening additional child-friendly spaces in shelters.
