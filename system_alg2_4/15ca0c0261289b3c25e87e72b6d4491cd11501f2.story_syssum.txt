(CNN) -- Jon and Marion Setzer knew tragic loss and comforted others who suffered the same.
He was 74; she was 72.
When the couple were growing their family, a neighbor's dog killed their 3-year-old son, Jon Setzer's former law partner George Cate Jr. told CNN affiliate WZTV.
Marion Setzer was a dental assistant, Cate said.
Living trusts were a new at the time, and Setzer became known for hosting highly touted seminars where he explained what they were, Cate said.
Jon Setzer and his son-in-law were business partners, the affiliate reported.
"They were just sweet people," said the Rev.
