Susan, aka "Ginormica," has to save the world in "Monsters vs.

Roller skates work because they have fixed wheels.
High concepts, top-notch voice talent and scattershot pop cultural references are no compensation for a coherent script.
(Seth Rogen) an amorphous blue jelly-like blob who gets on just fine without a brain; Missing Link (Will Arnett), a gung-ho amphibian who's all mouth; and a giant dust mite called Insectosaurus who isn't voiced by anyone because he doesn't have anything to say.
Ginormica gets a kick-butt finale, and is a much stronger character -- in any number of ways -- than the movie's president.
