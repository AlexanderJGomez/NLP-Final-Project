He was swimming 200 meters (220 yards) offshore near Muriwai Beach, about 25 kilometers (15 miles) from central Auckland when the 12-to-14-foot shark struck.
Mose said he believed at least two other sharks had joined in the frenzy around the body after a few minutes.
Following the death, police closed the beach and several others nearby.
There have been fewer than 20 shark attack deaths in more than 175 years in New Zealand, the agency said.
