Diego Leon Montoya Sanchez was captured in his underwear, hiding in bushes, Gen. Mario Montoya Uribe said.
Montoya was responsible for as much as 70 percent of the cocaine sold in the United States and Europe and his organization ordered 1,500 assassinations, Santos said.
Plans revved up three days ago, when informants told authorities that Montoya was in the town of Salsa in the department of El Valle, he said.
"This morning, at 4:30 a.m., we got the green light."
But a soldier searching outside the house saw leaves of a bush move and found the suspect hiding, clad in his underwear, Montoya Uribe said.
Montoya Sanchez's two brothers are also in custody on drug charges.
