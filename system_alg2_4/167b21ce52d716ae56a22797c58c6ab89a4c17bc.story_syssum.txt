Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea announced Friday that it has detained a U.S. citizen who it says entered the secretive country as a tourist in April and broke the law.
The U.S. State Department said it was "aware of reports that a third U.S. citizen was detained in North Korea."
The U.S. State Department said at the time that it was aware of the report and had been in touch with Sweden, which represents American interests in North Korea, about the matter.
Other Americans detained in the North have later been released.
