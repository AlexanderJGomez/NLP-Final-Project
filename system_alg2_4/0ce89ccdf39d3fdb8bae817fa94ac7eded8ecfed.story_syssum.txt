Sanford, Florida (CNN) -- George Zimmerman was booked into jail Sunday after surrendering to authorities before an afternoon deadline, the Seminole County sheriff said.
Eslinger said Zimmerman, who will be housed in administrative confinement at Seminole County's John E. Polk Correctional Facility, was "quiet and cooperative."
Zimmerman's cell is designed to hold two inmates and is about 67 square feet, the sheriff's office said.
"While out on bond, Mr. Zimmerman has been living in a secure, undisclosed location as there are significant threats against his life," his attorneys said Sunday on the official website for his defense.
Lester ordered Zimmerman back to jail, saying the 28-year-old was not truthful about how much money he had access to when he was freed on bond in April.
Zimmerman's attorneys said they will request a new bond hearing to address the issue.
Asked about the possibility that Zimmerman's wife could be charged with perjury, O'Mara said that statement was out of his control.
Citing recorded jailhouse conversations between Zimmerman and his wife, prosecutors alleged the two spoke in code when discussing the money in a credit union account, according to a court documents filed Friday by State Attorney Angela B. Corey.
The judge "relied on false representations and statements" by Zimmerman and his wife when the court set his bond at $150,000, Corey said.
Lester appeared angry that the court had not been told about the money.
O'Mara said he had discussed the judge's decision with Zimmerman, who was not in court.
