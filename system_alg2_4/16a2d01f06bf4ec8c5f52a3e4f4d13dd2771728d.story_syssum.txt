(CNN) -- Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir asked Arab leaders meeting in Qatar on Monday to strongly reject an arrest warrant issued against him by the International Criminal Court for war crimes.
"We appreciate your support for Sudan in many areas," al-Bashir said.
Sudan expelled 13 international aid agencies from the Darfur region after the ICC issued the arrest warrant.
The International Criminal Court accuses al-Bashir of complicity in war crimes and crimes against humanity in his government's campaign against rebels in Darfur, in western Sudan.
At the State Department, deputy spokesman Gordon Duguid said leaders at the summit should deal with the situation in Darfur.
"I am an international leader," Gadhafi said before leaving.
