(Financial Times) -- South Korean financial regulators will investigate the Seoul branches of Standard Chartered and HSBC in light of money laundering allegations against both banks by regulators in the US.
"We will look into their businesses related to money laundering comprehensively to see if they reported suspicious transactions, including those with the countries with which financial transactions are restricted, and if they verified their customers [before such transactions]," the FSS said.
"The Korean financial regulators have always been quite mindful of the US sanctions and the regulations related to Iranian counterparties," he said.
It reached a preliminary agreement in April to sell its Korean retail business to Korea Development Bank, but talks broke down last month.
StanChart, which acquired Korea First Bank in 2005, was badly affected last year by strikes caused by its attempt to introduce performance-related pay.
