There was no one other than the driver in the car at the time, police spokeswoman Esther Naber said.
"Queens Day will never be the same," the Trouw newspaper said.
Is that still possible now the royal family has been the target of an attack?"
Although Queen Beatrix's birthday is January 31, she officially celebrates her birthday April 30, according to the Dutch government.
The day is marked with the color orange all over the country as a reference to the colors of the royal family, who come from the House of Orange-Nassau.
