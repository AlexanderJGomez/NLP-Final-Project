(CNN) -- Costume designer Mark Bridges can create eras with fabric.
He spoke with CNN about how his job combines the best of all worlds, and what (or "who," for those who prefer the favored Oscar pre-show word) he'll be wearing on the red carpet.
My mother used to take us to revival houses because I was interested in it, so it's always been a lifelong interest of mine.
It became a story of textures telling the story.
I read it, we discuss it, then I go out and try to figure out what language of clothing are we making this story.
Bridges: I was always involved in theater and drama.
As a child, I loved movies, I always drew, I always loved fabric, I loved clothes, I loved color, I loved telling a story.
