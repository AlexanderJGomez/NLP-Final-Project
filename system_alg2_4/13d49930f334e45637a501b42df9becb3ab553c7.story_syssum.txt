The justices unanimously found the world's largest seed producer has intellectual property control over its best-selling "Roundup Ready" soybeans.
"Bowman planted Monsanto's patented soybeans solely to make and market replicas of them thus depriving the company of the reward patent law provides for the sale of each article," said Justice Elena Kagan.
Its Roundup Ready variety is used to grow about 90 percent of the nation's crop for the estimated 275,000 American soybean farmers like Bowman, according to its petition.
Those soybeans cost more and farmers must agree not to replant their progeny, thus buying seeds each year.
But Bowman said there were no restrictions on how he used the mixed-variety seeds, which he did for eight consecutive fall crops.
Mark Walters, Bowman's attorney, said farmers take all the risks when they plant, while the company can sit back and control how its products are used in perpetuity.
But Monsanto, backed by the Obama administration and a range of businesses, say protecting intellectual property is more important than ever, especially in fast-developing technological fields.
But it was Bowman, and not the bean, who controlled the reproduction (to the eighth generation) of Monsanto's patented invention."
The case is Bowman v. Monsanto Company (11-796).
