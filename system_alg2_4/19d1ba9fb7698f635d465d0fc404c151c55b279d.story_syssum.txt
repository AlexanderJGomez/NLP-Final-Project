The time has come for all to accept that terrorists cannot be treated as criminals.
Finally, even terrorists not bent on committing suicide attacks are often "true believers" who are prepared to proceed despite whatever punishments the legal system may throw at them.
Nor should terrorists be treated as soldiers, a dignified profession and calling.
Obama surely has the legal training to realize that our minds are big enough to cope with more than two categories, that terrorists are neither fish nor fowl, neither criminals nor soldiers, but a distinct species.
As such, terrorists are not without any rights.
Some terrorists are to be tried in civilian courts -- as long as they are not in New York, or maybe only if the civilian courts are located on a military base.
