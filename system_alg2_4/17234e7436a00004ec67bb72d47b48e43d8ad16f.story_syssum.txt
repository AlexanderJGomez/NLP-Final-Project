Let's be honest, Western Moms would also relish these dazzling results -- valedictorian and violin virtuosity -- but can't imagine themselves, or their kids, committing to the rigid Chinese Mom-style method to guarantee perfection.
But more importantly, Western Moms, and in particular working moms, just don't have the time, energy, or well, discipline.
Maybe modern day parenting in America has become too permissive.
Seriously, 15 minutes.
Yes, our kids need to excel at algebra, but we want them to not only learn, but to also enjoy learning in a stimulating environment where they can thrive in their own uniqueness.
"Tenacious practice, practice, practice is crucial for excellence; rote repetition is underrated in America," Chua writes.
The Western touchy-feely approach runs counter to the Chinese Mom philosophy.
For Chinese moms, a less-than-perfect child is a disgrace to the family, a slap-in-the-face to the parents -- utter shame.
Western moms just don't get this.
We simply don't have time.
Sure.
Not happening.
I think Western moms are a little envious of at least part of the Chinese mom method.
Maybe that was worth missing all of the sleepovers and play dates and summer camp, but then again, maybe not.
