Van der Sloot also was charged with robbery in last week's slaying of Stephany Flores Ramirez, according to a release from the Lima Superior Court of Justice.
Van der Sloot told authorities he attacked Flores on May 30 after she read an e-mail on his computer connected with the Holloway case, Peruvian national police said in a statement Thursday.
Van der Sloot was arrested in Chile on June 3 and returned to the next day to Peru, where police say he confessed to killing Flores.
In the Holloway case, van der Sloot told investigators during an interrogation that he knows the location of her body, a Peruvian police official said.
Van der Sloot's lawyer, Maximo Alonso Altez Navarro, has said he plans to ask the judge in the case to strike down van der Sloot's confession because he was not properly represented when he was interrogated.
Bloodstains found on van der Sloot's clothes match Flores' blood type, he said.
After killing her, the police statement said, van der Sloot cleaned the room in an attempt to hide evidence of the crime, changed clothes and fled with Flores' money, bank cards and black Jeep.
Police said the evidence against van der Sloot includes his confession, forensic data, surveillance videos and fingerprints from the crime scene and Flores' Jeep.
A FBI affidavit says van der Sloot tried to extort money from Holloway's mother.
In exchange for the money, the document said, van der Sloot showed the representative a house where Holloway's remains supposedly were buried.
According to the affidavit, van der Sloot said his father helped him conceal Holloway's body and buried it under the house a few days later while van der Sloot waited in a car.
"Van der Sloot added that he had not actually seen his father inter the remains but was told and shown by his father where the body was buried," the affidavit states.
