(CNN) -- The U.S. Navy has started a force to battle pirates attacking ships in and near the Gulf of Aden off Somalia's coast, the U.S. Fifth Fleet said Thursday.
That came just days after China revealed its own plans to patrol the Horn of Africa's volatile coastline.
Task Force 151 will be devoted solely to counterpiracy efforts, said Lt. Stephanie Murdock, a Fifth Fleet spokeswoman.
Pirates attacked nearly 100 vessels and hijacked as many as 40 in the waters off the coast of Somalia in 2008, according to the International Maritime Bureau.
"Who can stop them?"
Boyah said.
"We went into the deep ocean and hijacked the unarmed cargo ships," Boyah said.
The task forces are part of the Combined Maritime Forces, which includes naval ships and other assets from more than 20 nations.
He cited the presence of navies in the gulf and the fact that merchant mariners are taking more appropriate measures to avert hijackings as reasons for the decline.
He welcomed the establishment of the task force.
