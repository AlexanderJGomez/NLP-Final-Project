(CNN) -- It was a day of firsts at the World Cup as France got a boost from technology and Bosnia and Herzegovina scored a groundbreaking goal.
The problem is Sead Kolasinac knocked it into the wrong net, scoring an own goal just 3 minutes into the game.
Messi scored a sublime goal in the 65th minute, on a give-and-go with Gonzalo Higuain that led to a strong left foot off the inside of the post.
Defeat was snatched from the jaws of victory when Switzerland quickly counterattacked in the dying seconds after Valon Behrami brilliantly tackled Ecuador's Michael Arroyo, who appeared certain to score in stoppage time.
Seferovic's 93rd minute goal was the latest anyone has ever scored in World Cup group play, according to ESPN.
A player barely gets a toe on a ball to poke it away from an attacker.
While the fans at the stadium watched replays and booed the referee's call, new goal line technology showed it was indeed a goal.
It was the first goal confirmed by goal line technology -- introduced at this World Cup by FIFA.
Only?
While the number of goals per game had been trending down since the 1994 World Cup held in the United States, this tournament has seen an early explosion in the number of balls hitting the back of the net.
Ok, we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves; there are 52 matches left.
