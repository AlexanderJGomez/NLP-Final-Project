"He's going to be part of the history," Addahoumi said about his son, Sammi, who is in the rebel hub of Benghazi.
Addahoumi spoke to CNN from his home in Columbia, South Carolina, where he said he was glued to news about Libya.
Over the years, Addahoumi said he has returned to Libya from time to time and that he wishes he could be there now.
He also spoke to CNN by phone.
Watching the uprising, which he called "42 years in the making," Sammi said he was filled with joy.
An ocean away, his father voiced confidence.
"Libya is going to be a new nation."
