(CNN) -- After an extensive, month-long buildup, Yahoo has finally unveiled its new logo.
Both have a slight beveled effect, though it's more noticeable on the purple text.
"We didn't want to have any straight lines in the logo.
Straight lines don't exist in the human form and are extremely rare in nature, so the human touch in the logo is that all the lines and forms all have at least a slight curve," Mayer added in her post, which goes into exhaustive detail about the thinking behind the logo.
"Sharing these logo variations prepares people for change, so there's less risk of what happened to Gap," said David Airey, a graphic designer specializing in brand identity.
"The logo is only part of a brand new branding and image campaign.
"A bad logo is all it took for Yahoo!
Yahoo hasn't updated its logo since 2009, and it has been mostly the same since 1995.
It'll just need to be freshened up," said Airey.
