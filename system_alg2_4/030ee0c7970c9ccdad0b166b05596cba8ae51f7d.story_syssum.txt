Five years ago, we were in the OR, side by side as one of his kidneys was transferred into my body, saving my life.
I marveled at his ability to make a quick decision that would alter both of our bodies forever.
Many people are not as fortunate as I was.
I believe that many more people would do what my father did for me if they knew more about the transplant process and outcomes.
Every day I remind myself what a precious gift my father has given me.
To show my appreciation, the best gift I will give my dad this Father's Day is to take care of my health and to live each day to its fullest.
And I plan on giving that gift to him for many Father's Days to come.
