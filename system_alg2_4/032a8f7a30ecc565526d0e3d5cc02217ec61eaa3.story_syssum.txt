(CNN) -- A total solar eclipse occurred over the northeastern Australian coast early in the morning of November 14 local time.
A total eclipse of the sun can only be seen from within what's known as the path of totality, a narrow path the moon's inner shadow travels as it glides across the Earth.
Totality was expected to begin in Cairns at 0638 local time and was to last nearly two minutes.
What's all the fuss about?
But for any given region, a total solar eclipse only happens, on average, once every 375 years.
A solar eclipse is often described as one of nature's most awe-inspiring events.
There are changes in the color of the sky, the temperature drops, birds and animals behave in a peculiar manner and shadows sharpen, according to Rick Brown, an eclipse chaser from New York who is viewing his 14th total solar eclipse.
Just before totality, so-called Baily's beads â€” bright spots of sunlight shining through the moon's craggy surface â€” can appear around the moon.
Where can I see this eclipse?
Only during totality can you remove filters and glasses.
Among them:
-- Leave your flash attachment at home
-- Keep your setup as portable, light and easy to assemble as possible in case you need to relocate in a hurry to escape clouds.
