The divers stopped searching months ago because of the winter and water conditions, and the South Korean ferry remains on the bottom of the sea floor.
Park said.
Park's case is an unsettling one -- emblematic of what remains unresolved a year after the Sewol ferry sank.
On April 16, the Sewol ferry, carrying hundreds of high school students, began sinking after taking a sharp turn.
Anger over how the crew failed to evacuate the passengers intensified when video surfaced of the ferry's captain in his underwear leaping into the arms of the Korean Coast Guard while hundreds remained trapped in the vessel.
A government study on raising the ferry released last week identified a crane and floating dock as the safest way to look for the missing.
Since the days immediately after the disaster, families have criticized the government over its response.
The captain of the first coast guard ship sent to rescue the Sewol passengers was found guilty of negligence and making false reports.
Park, the South Korean president, pledged major reforms, dismantled the coast guard and vowed an investigation into what went wrong.
An inexperienced crew and redesigns of the ship to handle more passengers and cargo were also cited as factors in the disaster.
"The tragedy of Sewol was also virtually caused by accumulation of corruption, irregularity and going blind eyes," Park said on Thursday.
In the immediate aftermath, South Korean prosecutors arrested the captain, crew members and business associates.
Whether the ferry will be raised and an independent investigation will be held remains to be seen.
