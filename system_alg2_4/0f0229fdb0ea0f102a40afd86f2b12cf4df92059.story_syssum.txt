NEW YORK (CNN) -- A 15-year-old girl with a 500-texts-a-day texting habit thumbed her way to the $50,000 grand prize at the L.G.
Another round quizzed contestants' knowledge of texting acronyms.
Riffing off texters' sometimes dangerous tendency to text while performing other tasks, another round required contestants to complete an obstacle course while firing off difficult-to-type texts.
The finals on Tuesday afternoon pitted Dynda Morgan, 14, of Savannah, Georgia, against Moore.
Faced with a do-or-die situation in the second round, Moore seemed to bet on accuracy over speed, finishing well behind her opponent but winning the round.
Kate's beaming mother, Claire, acknowledged that she has confiscated her daughter's phone on occasion, but said she appreciates that her daughter's texting habit means she's in constant touch.
Moments after her victory, Moore agreed to an exclusive text message interview with CNN.
Moore: It feels the best!

CNN.
CNN: Kthxbi.
