Saucedo grew up in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez across the border in Mexico, and says violence is now a normal part of life on the border.
I decided to use a piñata because it's a way to identify with my culture," Saucedo said in a phone interview.
"I got a pressure gun and shot each piñata so it would look like a gunshot.
I also filled the pressure gun with red paint so it would drip down the face," Saucedo said.
El Paso Library spokesman Jack Galindo said the library had only one official complaint -- a man said he was "very offended" by the pieces.
I feel it's my responsibility as an artist to represent those feelings," said Saucedo.
"We have anything from one dead a day to six or seven.
"Ciudad Juarez es the .1" will run until July 31.
