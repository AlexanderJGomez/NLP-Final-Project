(CNN) -- The flight data and cockpit voice recorders from JetBlue Flight 191, which made an emergency landing this week, have been retrieved and will be analyzed, officials said Thursday.
Crew and passengers subdued Osbon as he screamed and banged on the door so hard the first officer thought Osbon would come through, according to a federal criminal complaint filed Wednesday against Osbon.
Osbon told the FO that 'we're not going to Vegas,' and began giving what the FO described as a sermon."
About 3Â½ hours into the planned five-hour flight from New York's Kennedy International Airport to Las Vegas, the pilot left the cockpit to use the lavatory, but he failed to follow security protocol, alarming the crew, according to an affidavit filed in support of an arrest warrant.
By that time, the first officer had summoned another JetBlue pilot who had been traveling as a passenger to enter the cockpit and the two locked themselves inside, the affidavit states.
Osbon, who was been charged with interfering with a flight crew, has not made a public statement.
He just did what he was paid to do," Jean Beatrice Dowd said of Jason Dowd.
He called his parents the night of the incident, his mother said.
The incident "has been earthshaking for us, too," she said.
He was in New York, speaking with officials about the incident, his mother said.
I've only known Clayton to be a cheerful, conscientious and caring person."
