(Oprah.com) -- It came as no surprise to a woman we'll call Joan when, after 16 years of marriage, she and her husband started discussing the possibility of divorce.
Those are among the suggestions given in Awakening Joy, a class taught by James Baraz, a meditation instructor and founding teacher of Spirit Rock Meditation Center in Woodacre, California.

"That's important," says Holden.
"Awakening Joy isn't about being a happy little do bee," she says.

"My husband and I are still together, and in a way that I honestly didn't think was possible."
"Then I realized that the Buddha was called the Happy One, and he said, 'Go for the highest happiness.'
"The instructions made a lot of sense, but they didn't have a spiritual dimension," Baraz says.
Word of mouth about the course that could make people happier began to spread: The first round of Awakening Joy meetings consisted of about 40 members.

In addition to being a "serious" woman from a depressive family, Gretchen also found herself in chronic pain after sustaining a back injury.
"It was horrible," she recalls.
"The first thing I was hit by was the instruction to notice what it feels like when you're happy," she says.
I still have chronic pain, but I know there's a lot to feel good about."
If you have the intention to be happy and you do the practices, if you give it your best shot and are very patient, it works."
Is it really possible to become happier just by deciding you can?
