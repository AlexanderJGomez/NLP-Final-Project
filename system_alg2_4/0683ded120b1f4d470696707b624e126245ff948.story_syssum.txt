Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The alleys and archways along Rashid Street in central Tripoli were plunged in darkness this weekend, as the Libyan capital struggled to cope with widespread shortages of electricity.
My father's neighborhood hasn't had electricity for five straight days," said one Libyan man who asked not to be named, for fear of attracting the ire of government authorities.
Some residents complain pumps have stopped channeling water to their apartment buildings, leaving them without both water and light.
"Surely a large country like Libya doesn't depend on one power station," the Libyan man said.
In an e-mail to CNN, NATO military spokesman denied accusations that the alliance targeted Libyan electrical power lines.
a taxi driver yelled on Saturday, as he thumped a plastic jug full of fuel sitting in the back passenger seat of his car.
Hopes for a reprieve in the fuel shortages were dashed this week when the regime in Tripoli announced rebels somehow seized control of the fuel tanker ship Cartagena off the coast of Malta.
"The age of piracy is coming back to the Mediterranean because of NATO," Kaim concluded.
NATO concluded that the ship could proceed to its next port of call Benghazi.
Abdullah said the power outages began within the last two weeks.
One man carrying a shopping bag stopped to accuse foreign journalists of being the cause of the crisis.
"The government is lying and the rebels will be in Tripoli soon," one man said nervously, before quickly walking away.
