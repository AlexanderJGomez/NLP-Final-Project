(CNN) -- I'm standing in the secret Amsterdam apartment where Anne Frank and her family spent two years hiding from Nazis during the Second World War.
It's hoped the production -- which features lavishly designed sets that revolve and glide across a giant panoramic stage -- will bring the story of the young Jewish diarist to a new generation.
"The level of detail is crazy," says Robin De Levita, the show's Tony Ã…ward-winning producer, as he takes me behind the scenes, where a life-sized Amsterdam apartment block is parked, ready to roll on stage.
Its creators hope it will become a permanent fixture, attracting some of the visitors who line up for hours to see the original annex inside Amsterdam's canal-side Anne Frank Museum.
"It's all inspired by Anne's own writing," says De Winter.
"It's almost like a tragic-comedy -- a very cruel sitcom," says De Winter.
"It's just such a big part of Dutch history," she says.
Not Jewish herself, she joined the rest of the cast on fact-finding trips to Auschwitz concentration camp and spoke with Jewish people who went into hiding like Anne.
The Anne Frank Foundation, an educational charity that holds soon-to-expire copyright to the diary, commissioned the play in the hope of reaching out to a new generation almost 70 years after Frank died.
It will be a meaningful experience.
