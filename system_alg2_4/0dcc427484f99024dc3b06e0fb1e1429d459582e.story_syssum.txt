Babylon, Iraq (CNN)ISIS has smashed priceless ancient statues in Mosul, bulldozed the ruins of Nineveh and Hatra, and dynamited centuries-old churches, mosques and shrines.
One of Hussein's former palaces still peers down over the city.
"This wasn't Saddam's," said Adnan Abu Fatima.
Why?"
Why did you do that?"
Baghdad's museum was plundered, during a lapse in U.S. security, and the priceless artifacts were smuggled around the world.
Hassan fled Mosul when ISIS overran it last year then later ransacked the museum.
Iraq will defend its heritage against ISIS, said Mohamed Hattab from Iraq's Antiquities Department.
After the rage of a battle subsided, they moved in to the outskirt town of Awja to find the former dictator's tomb flattened.
It was a piece of history they were glad to part with.
