Britain's Prince Charles has called on governments around the world to do more to ensure religious freedom and urged religious leaders to promote tolerance between people of different faiths.
"First and foremost, rather than remaining silent, faith leaders have -- it seems to me -- a responsibility to ensure that people within their own tradition respect people from other faith traditions," he said.
"Yet even in the West this right is often challenged sadly -- and in many other countries, an absence of freedom to determine one's own faith is woven into the laws and customs of the nation," he said.
And he urged those facing persecution not to give up hope, while remaining strong in their faith.
Overall, 20 countries are designated as having a high degree of religious persecution.
