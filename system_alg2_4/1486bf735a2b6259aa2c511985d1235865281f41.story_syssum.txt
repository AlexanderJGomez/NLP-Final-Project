Henry Ford, pictured in 1942, unsuccessfully attempted to increase the rubber supply with a plantation in Brazil.
In 1927, Ford came up with a novel plan: He'd solve his rubber problem and test out his lofty theories about social planning.
In theory, this setup seemed like one of Ford's ideas that would shake out pretty well, and in 1928, Ford sent a barge full of supplies from Michigan down to his new plantation town, which was dubbed "Fordlandia."
According to Greg Grandin, author of "Fordlandia: The Rise and Fall of Henry Ford's Forgotten Jungle City," Ford never consulted any sort of expert on rubber cultivation; he just sent a bunch of supplies and managers into the jungle hoping to grow some rubber.
Fordlandia's trees were no exception, and caterpillars and blight quickly decimated the fields.
Obviously, the rubber production part of the Fordlandia got off to a rocky start.
The catch here, though, was that the indigenous Brazilians who farmed the rubber weren't used to living in a stylized American community.
Ford's influence extended all the way down to the residents' diets, and while the indigenous workers weren't crazy about having to eat American foods, they were livid about having to eat in a cafeteria setting rather than enjoying the homestyle meals to which they were accustomed.
Although Prohibition wasn't exactly an unqualified success at home, and although alcohol was still legal in Brazil, Ford stayed firm on his booze ban.
Although Ford spent 17 years trying to produce rubber on the plantation, no Ford car ever rolled off the assembly line with a single bit of Fordlandia's rubber in it.
