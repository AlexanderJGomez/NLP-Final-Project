The most chilling, frightening and heartbreaking moment at any Olympics came 40 years ago, at the 1972 Munich Olympics, when nearly a dozen Israeli athletes were taken hostage and killed in what was a terrorist attack by any definition of the term.
Now, that tragedy has become the source of more disheartening behavior, this time by officials of the International Olympic Committee, who adamantly refuse to mark the anniversary of that dark day with a simple moment of silence.
..."
Olympic officials claim -- quite falsely -- that they would never mix politics with the games.
We know that Hitler used the 1936 Olympics to promote his ideas of Aryan superiority, and we know the United States and the Soviet Union boycotted the games for political reasons.
The real reason is simple: Olympic officials are afraid to upset countries with anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian sentiment.
Standing against the slaying of Olympic athletes has nothing to do with the politics of the Middle East.
This year, the campaign to honor the victims has mustered more support than ever, with several countries and tens of thousands of people around the world joining in the effort.
But the IOC refuses to listen.
Anouk said of Munich 1972: "We just want one word from the IOC that this wasn't just a regular Olympics, that our fathers were killed there."
The ongoing petition for a moment of silence clearly states that this should not be a political moment.
But the IOC apparently sees this as a purely Israeli problem.
Australia Prime Minister Julia Gillard wrote to Rogge, officially asking for the moment of silence.
In Italy, 125 MPs also signed a letter to the IOC in support of the moment of silence.
Perhaps the London committee will give the families of the Israeli victims the recognition they want for their loved ones.
