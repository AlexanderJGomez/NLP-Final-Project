Even as Google's new Nexus 7 challenges the Kindle Fire for dominance in the small-tablet category, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos on Thursday introduced a new, 8.9-inch Kindle Fire HD.
So, how do the latest version of the iPad and the Kindle Fire HD stack up?
While Amazon obviously closed the gap significantly, the iPad still has a bigger screen than the Fire.
(There's speculation the iPhone 5 will have a larger screen).
Until now, the Kindle Fire has been a WiFi-only device, and some of its new models remain that way.
But Bezos announced that the top-end version of the Fire HD is available in 4G.
When the first iPad launched, AT&T offered data plans starting at $15 per month, or $180 per year, for 250 megabytes of data.
It's safe to say Amazon's is going to be less expensive, although it offers a minimal amount of data.
There are more than 225,000 apps designed specifically for the iPad.
But while the Kindle Fire runs a modified version of Google's Android operating system, it only runs apps available from Amazon.
