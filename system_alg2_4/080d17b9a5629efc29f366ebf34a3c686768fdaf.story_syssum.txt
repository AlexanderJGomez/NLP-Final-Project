George Kalogeropoulos, who created the site along with Ning Liang and Michael Wasser, said all three of them had tried using the government website to get insurance.
"The Health Sherpa is a free guide that makes it easier to find and sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.
We only use carefully vetted, publicly available data," the site reads.
Of course, it's not fair to compare the creation of Health Sherpa to the rollout of the more complicated government ACA site, which everyone from President Obama on down has acknowledged as a horribly botched affair.
Creating the original Sherpa site took three days and cost "several hundred dollars," according to Kalogeropoulos.
"Tens of thousands of  people have clicked through to buy a specific plan, suggesting that we are achieving our goal: helping people find a health insurance plan."
As it scrambles to fix the heath care site, the government  has sought to inject a little more Silicon Valley into the process by enlisting a "Tech Surge" of staffers from Oracle and Red Hat, as well as Michael Dickerson, a site reliability engineer on leave from Google.
