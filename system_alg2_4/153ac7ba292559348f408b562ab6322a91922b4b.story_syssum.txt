Fukushima, Japan (CNN) -- Mikio Watanabe's Fukushima home is contaminated with radiation and filled with the nightmares of his wife's horrific suicide.
As evacuees from last year's Fukushima nuclear disaster, Mikio and Hamako lost everything: their home, their jobs, and any hope for the future.
In a landmark case, Watanabe filed a lawsuit last month against TEPCO, blaming the utility company for his wife's suicide.
Watanabe wants TEPCO to compensate and treat victims for a man-made accident, which would expedite how the company cares for evacuees.
"She cried so much and repeatedly asked me to take her to our home," he says.
"We talked a lot then," recalls Watanabe.
Watanabe went to bed with his wife, feeling happier and more comfortable than he had in many weeks.
"The next morning, I woke up early around 4 a.m.
Watanabe continued to weed around his house and went inside to take a shower.
Watanabe says it's strange what you remember in trauma.
This wasn't supposed to happen, says Watanabe.
"We lost everything," he says.
I lost my wife in such a terrible way.
TEPCO has begun decontaminating affected communities.
Due to the size of the affected area, TEPCO and the Japanese government are unable to estimate if and when residents will ever be able to return.
