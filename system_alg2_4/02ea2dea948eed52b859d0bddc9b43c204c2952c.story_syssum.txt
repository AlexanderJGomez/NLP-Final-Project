(CNN) -- Millions of American parents spend countless hours trying to figure out how to help their children get better grades, better teachers or better schools.
In comparison, American students' combined performance in reading, mathematics and science places the United States at 21st among 34 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries.
First, Finland has built a school system that has over time strengthened educational equity.
According to the most recent data provided by the OECD the average teaching load of junior high school teachers in Finland is about half what it is in the United States.
Schooldays are also shorter in Finland than in the United States, and primary schools keep the homework load to a minimum so students have time for their own hobbies and friends when school is over.
Some aspects of the American school system are not helpful in improving education quality and equity.
First, education in the United States is too much defined by testing and data.
Frequent turnover of teachers in thousands of American schools undermines the entire education system.
The ultimate test for the American education system will be whether it can bring equity to the forefront of education policies.
Enhancing equity has been one key to success in Finland.
