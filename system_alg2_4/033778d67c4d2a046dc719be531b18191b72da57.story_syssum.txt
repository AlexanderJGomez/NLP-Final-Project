(CNN) -- President Obama said that police in Cambridge, Massachusetts, "acted stupidly" in arresting a prominent black Harvard professor last week after a confrontation at the man's home.
Obama defended Gates on Wednesday night, while admitting that he may be "a little biased," because Gates is a friend.
The mayor of Cambridge said she is going to meet with the city's police chief to make sure the scenario that caused Gates' arrest does not happen again.

Gates said Simmons called him to apologize.
James Crowley, told CNN affiliate WCVB earlier Wednesday that he will not apologize.
Gates said the mayor of Cambridge, Massachusetts, called him to apologize about the incident, in which he was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct.
Crowley wrote in the Cambridge police report that Gates refused to step outside to speak with him, the police report said, and when Crowley told Gates that he was investigating a possible break-in, Gates opened the front door and exclaimed, "Why, because I'm a black man in America?"

Earlier this week, a prosecutor dropped the charge against Gates and the city's police department recommended that the matter not be pursued.
