Scandinavian Airlines grounded its fleet of Dash 8 Q400 planes after three crash landings in 2007.
Daly said propeller-driven aircraft such as the Canadian-built Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 and its European rival, the ATR series, had sold well to airlines in the last three years because they were almost as fast as jets, cruising at about 480 kilometers/hour (300 mph), but used much less fuel.
"All aircraft have de-icing system: a big jet like a 747 can cope with ice almost indefinitely, but smaller planes, especially propeller planes can experience problems," he said.
About two minutes later, the air traffic controller came back, with stress in his voice.
Radar contact was lost.
The pilot's last comment was "Colgan Flight 3407."
Air expert Daly said though that in Thursday's crash the landing gear of the Continental plane was unlikely to be down because it was far from the airport.
The National Transportation Safety Board said early Friday it was preparing to send a team to Buffalo to investigate the crash.
