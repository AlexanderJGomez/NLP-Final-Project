Telling people "Happy New Year" more than a week after the first of the year is like keeping your Christmas lights up until February.
And I grew up in New Jersey; I know a thing or two about tacky.
Seamon-Primas told me: "In my opinion, after the first week, I stop wishing others a Happy New Year, the new year is well on its way."
If you really care about how my year is going, ask me in October.
And when is the last time you heard a "Happy St. Patrick's Day" on March 19?
Go ahead and joyfully exchange wishes of "Have a Merry Christmas" the week before the holiday through Christmas Day, but not on December 29.
But among the vast array of omens that predict good fortune for the coming year, not one involves saying Happy New Year's for weeks on end.
If even one custom instructed us that extended New Year's wishes would increase the chances the year would indeed be a good one, I'd be saying Happy New Year's every day until April.
However, even if you are reading this after January 7, I still sincerely wish you, and your family, a very happy and healthy New Year.
