The native of Germany who owns a real estate company in the Mexican beach resort says he immediately fell in love with the place.
Temperatures in the mid to upper 80s Fahrenheit (about 30 Celsius), sunny skies, and cool breezes are among the main reasons why countless foreigners have made Acapulco their paradise for decades.
According to local officials, at least 3,000 foreigners including Americans, Canadians, and Europeans call Acapulco home.
"Right now the market is down in terms of sales, but the prices have maintained, surprisingly stable," says Clemens, who owns a property management, realty, and villas rental company called Beachfront Acapulco.
Natalie Farmer, a Canadian who owns a time-share condominium and has spent weeks here every year since she was a little girl, has kept coming with her family in children in spite of the violence.
And I think it's safe," says Farmer.
Twenty-two-year-old Shana Dewale, a native of Belgium, has spent spring breaks here since she was a toddler.
I come every year and it's the best vacation I have," says Dewale.
"Once you're here, you won't want to leave because we've got the beach, we've got the breeze.
