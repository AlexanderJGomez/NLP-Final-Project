The number of people arrested in London since the violence began has risen to 334, police said Tuesday.
There was evidence of vandalism in central London, with visible damage to a number of shops.
People already in the city centre should leave the area and go home," Bristol police said in a statement early Tuesday.

Several hundred people in the center of Peckham in South London threw projectiles -- stones, clay pots and bottles -- with one policeman saying, "they raided the bottle bank," CNN's Dan Rivers reported from the scene.

Saturday's riots occurred after the shooting death Thursday of Mark Duggan, a black man, as he was seated inside a cab.
The commission divulged neither who shot Duggan nor why police had stopped the cab, with the incident still under investigation.
The man's family and friends, who blamed police for the death, gathered Saturday night outside the Tottenham police station to protest.
In all, 35 police officers have been injured since the violence broke out, Metropolitan Police said.
Looting also occurred in pockets of Enfield, next to Tottenham, in north London.
"This is not about the black community and the police, it's about young people and the police," said Shaun Bailey, a youth worker, in a statement circulated by the mayor's office.

Police say they have evidence that some of the rioting was coordinated using social media, including Twitter.
