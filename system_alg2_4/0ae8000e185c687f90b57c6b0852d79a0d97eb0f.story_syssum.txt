Watson -- who works for Turner Broadcasting System, an entity that includes CNN -- and her partner were one of 57 couples to get same-sex marriage licenses in Ingham County, according to county clerk Barb Byrum.
Byrum, a Democrat elected to the county clerk post, said that she personally performed 30 ceremonies in Mason.
As to being among the first gay couples married in Michigan, Colasonti said, "It's historic, and we're glad we're a part of it.
And we are just happy."
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued an order Saturday to temporarily stay through at least Wednesday the decision by Friedman.
Watson said she isn't surprised by the stay and is bracing for the idea she and Sherman won't immediately have full benefits available to them in Michigan -- though she expects that, at least, they'll now have federal benefits available to marriage same-sex couples.
In fact, Friedman's ruling was the latest in a series of recent district judge decisions -- which have also affected Texas, Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Utah -- striking down state laws restricting marriage to one man and one woman.
"It's all in one direction right now," Tobias said.
"She's excited about it," Watson said.
