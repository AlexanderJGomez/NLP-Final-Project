An Ohio sheriff defended the killings of more than four dozen lions, tigers and other wild animals Wednesday after they were turned loose from a farm outside Zanesville by its suicidal owner.
Lutz told CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360" that none of his deputies are equipped with tranquilizer guns.
As of Wednesday afternoon, authorities had killed 49 animals -- 18 tigers, 17 lions, six black bears, two grizzly bears, three mountain lions, two wolves and a baboon.
He said the drugs take several minutes to subdue an animal even with a good shot, and one tiger had to be killed Wednesday afternoon when it turned on a veterinarian after being hit with a tranquilizer dart.

Zanesville Mayor Howard Zwelling said he received calls from people who were concerned that the animals had been killed.
"These are 300-pound Bengal tigers that we have had to put down," he said.
Sam Kopchak, Thompson's neighbor, said he saw lions and bears running free Tuesday evening, with one tiger chasing horses.
"It was like a war zone," Kopchak said when authorities descended on Thompson's property, set off the road named after Kopchak's family.
Kopchak saw him driving one time with a baby black bear on his chest.
The Humane Society of the United States and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals urged Ohio officials Wednesday to issue an emergency rule to crack down on exotic animal ownership in the wake of the slaughter.
Ted Strickland that prohibited people convicted of animal cruelty from owning exotic animals expired in April.
Douthitt said it is inappropriate for people like Thompson to keep dangerous animals as pets, just as it was to shoot so many of them.
Local governments, she said, ought to train law enforcement officers so they are prepared for bizarre cases such as the one that unfolded in Zanesville.
