Ahmad Shah Massoud, center in white shirt, leads his men in his beloved Afghan mountains.
The man Junger met was Ahmad Shah Massoud, the "Lion of Panjshir."
Today, Massoud is a national hero in Afghanistan, but he's also become something else: the prototype for the tough but enlightened leader Afghanistan desperately needs today, some Afghans say.
Massoud had a reputation for integrity and strength, says Junger, who traveled to Afghanistan in 2000 to profile Massoud for his book, "Fire."
"All he wanted was to have Afghanistan for Afghanistan," Shorish-Shamley says.
Massoud became Afghanistan's most famous resistance leader after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979.
Shorish-Shamley, the women's rights activist, says Massoud was assassinated just before the 9/11 attacks because bin Laden feared Massoud.
"If they [al Qaeda leaders] were hiding under a rock, he would have found them,'' Shorish-Shamley says.
After the Soviet army left Afghanistan, various Afghan resistance leaders cobbled together a coalition government to run the country.
Men under Massoud's command were accused of massacring civilians.
Marcela Grad, author of the book "Massoud," says he was the only Afghan resistance leader who never left the country to live abroad.
Grad says Massoud believed that his fight against the Taliban wasn't isolated but part of a larger battle against a Taliban-like Islam that threatened to spread across Central Asia.
Junger, who had interviewed Massoud the year before, says he was crushed by Massoud's death.
CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour, who covered the event, reported that Ahmad said that terrorists may have killed his father but not his vision of a united and free Afghanistan.
"I want to follow in my father's footsteps," Ahmad said.
