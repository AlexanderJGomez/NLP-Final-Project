The mother of Brooke Stegall, 5, says opera gave her visually impaired child new confidence.
The fact that these 10 children are performing this day is enough for them.
"These parents work so hard to make this happen," said Anne McComiskey, director of the program.
She is very aware of the efforts that both the children and the parents put into the program.
"First of all, we are teaching the parents how to teach their child," she said.
All of the children go to the center one day a week.
McComiskey says the performance reinforces lessons learned during the course of the program.
It's just many of the concepts that we have been teaching them for five years, coming to play in the opera."
So the movements help them feel safe in the space, and we learned to move, sing and play instruments at the same time, which is a challenge for anyone!"
McComiskey says that that is one of the goals of the program: to instill a sense of "I can" in the kids.
"That is most unusual, for a child that is blind or visually impaired to go right into a typical kindergarten," McComiskey said.
