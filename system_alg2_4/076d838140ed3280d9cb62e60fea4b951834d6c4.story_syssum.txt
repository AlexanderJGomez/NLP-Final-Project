(CNN) -- Terry McMillan writes best-selling fiction, but it was real-life drama -- a very public divorce -- that garnered her some of her biggest headlines.
"I just ended up realizing I had become this other person that I didn't like," McMillan said.
Though it touches on drug abuse, coming out of the closet and prison sentences, "Who Asked You?"
"A lot of the characters I write about aren't like me, with the exception there might be snippets or little particles of their personality that I might identify with," she said.
An edited transcript of the conversation follows:
McMillan: Well, I'll put it this way, I separate my personal life from what I write about regardless.
This book is not necessarily a reflection of my own personal experiences.
McMillan: You have to go through what you go through, regardless of what other people say.
I was grieving, and I was angry -- two bad combinations.
That's when you need to pay attention.
McMillan: No.
The bottom line is this -- this book had nothing to do with my personal life.
It was anger in that first paragraph.
A lot of people make their own deductions about what's real and what's not real.
McMillan: That I'm a die-hard romantic.
Romantic love probably tops all of them.
