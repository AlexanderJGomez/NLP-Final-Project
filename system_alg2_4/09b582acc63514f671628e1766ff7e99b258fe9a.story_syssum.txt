(CNN) -- Journalist Bob Woodward describes in his new book a secret U.S. program to assassinate terrorists in Iraq.
Michael Ware: Let's say that these "fusion teams," as they're being called, have come into effect.
I mean, the U.S. subcontracted out an assassination program against al Qaeda way back in early 2006.
Ware: It does work together.
But the key to the downturn in violence that we're seeing now is not so much the surge of 30,000 troops in itself.
This is your American militia, the counterbalance to the Iranian militias.
