The incident is chronicled in "Fruitvale Station," an independent film, scheduled for release on July 12, that tells the story of the last day of Grant's life.
"If Oscar were alive today, he'd be the same age as me right now, he'd be 27," Coogler, who grew up in the Bay Area, told CNN at the movie's New York premiere.
I hope the people can see a little bit of themselves in the character if they sit down and watch the film, and have a little bit of insight."

"Sadly, (this is) very topical ... we're losing way too many young men of color to this type of violence," she told CNN, comparing the case to the more recent Trayvon Martin shooting in February 2012.

"Your inner dialogue has to change, my inner dialogue has to change."
"I think when people see this film, they will see that all of these young men are ... they're human lives being lost," Spencer said.
