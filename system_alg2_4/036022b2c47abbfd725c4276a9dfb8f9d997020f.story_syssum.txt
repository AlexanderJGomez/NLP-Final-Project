(CNN) -- First it was McLaren, now it's the turn of Ferrari to unveil the car they hope will speed them to victory in the forthcoming Formula One season.
"We both want to win and time will tell what will happen and if we can bring the championship back to Ferrari," Raikkonen told the Ferrari F1 website.
This year's car is the 60th built by Ferrari for the F1 world championship with the F14 T name being chosen by fans via a poll on the Ferrari F1 team's website.
Jonathan Neale, managing director of McLaren Racing said in a statement: "We've never had such significant new regulations before; reacting to them, and managing those changes, while still pushing the performance limits, has been an extremely tough job.
Jenson Button, who will be partnered by Dane Kevin Magnussen this season, is looking forward to getting behind the wheel.
