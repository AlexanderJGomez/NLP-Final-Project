A lone sniper still remained in the nighttime distance.
Jack Tueller felt compelled to play his trumpet.
Back at the airstrip, Tueller took out his trumpet.
"I thought to myself, that German sniper is as lonely and scared as I am.
"I grabbed my trumpet and went down to the beach.
And, crying, he said, 'I couldn't fire because I thought of my fianc√©.
Tueller had learned to play the trumpet as a child growing up in Wyoming.
The famous trumpet player Louis Armstrong came up to the band during intermission and said, 'You sound pretty good for white cats,' " Tueller recalled.
"
And I said, 'Yes, ma'am, I did.'
In 1941, as war clouds gathered, Jack enlisted in the Army and was sent to fighter school because he was an "individualist," he said.
And we just shot at everything," he said.
I never came off enemy targets high.
And on each mission, Tueller carried his trumpet in the cockpit.
His tour of duty ended just before his fighter group left for Belgium and the Battle of the Bulge.
He still has his trumpet of 70 years and still performs at schools, family get-togethers and church functions.
"I was an unruly child," he said.
What a way to go!"
