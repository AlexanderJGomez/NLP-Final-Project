London (CNN) -- A court in central London this week found itself in the world's spotlight, as a small army of celebrities staked their reputations by turning up to offer support -- and bail money -- to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
"I think we are entitled to know the dealings of those that govern us."
I am offering my support to him as I believe in the universal right to freedom of information and our right to be told the truth."
Meanwhile, Vaughan Smith, the founder of London's Frontline Club which claims to "champion independent journalism," offered to accommodate Assange, who has no British address, at his sprawling family home in order to meet another of the bail conditions issued by the court Tuesday.
Certainly no credible charges have been brought regarding the leaking of the information itself."
Pilger, a long-time critic of U.S. foreign policy, has been particularly vocal in his support for Assange and the work of WikiLeaks.
He is an innocent man who has not been charged with anything, sitting in solitary confinement -- what is going on?"
He told reporters: "It's quite clear that the U.S. government and other governments have kept secrets hidden from us.
However in a post on his Twitter page the previous week, he wrote: "Julian Assange might be guilty of sex crimes.
In another post he claimed the U.S. government tried to discredit Vietnam War whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg in the 1970s.
"If the police have any accusations they should let him answer for them," she said, adding that he should be treated fairly.
