Haylee Donathan, her mother Candace Watson and Robbie Potter were discovered hiding for the past week at The Morning Star Ranch, a retreat in Valley Center, near San Diego, said Peter Elliott, United States Marshal for the Northern District of Ohio.
Late Tuesday Haylee was in the custody of a children's protective services agency in the San Diego County area, Elliott said.
"I am very happy that my granddaughter's coming home," said Mary Watson, Haylee's grandmother.
Watson, 24, and Potter, 27, were arrested without incident and held by the San Diego County Sheriff's Department.
Potter, a sex offender, had escaped a half-way house on May 28, the day the girl and her mother fell out of sight.
When she is returned to Ohio, Haylee will be placed in the custody of her grandmother, Elliott said.

While on the run, Potter and Watson were reportedly seen on surveillance video on May 31 at a Wal-Mart Store in Marion, Ohio, 40 miles from Mansfield.
In addition to other charges, he said Potter may be prosecuted under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, a federal sex offender registration and self-reporting law that carries a multi-year felony sentence if violated.
