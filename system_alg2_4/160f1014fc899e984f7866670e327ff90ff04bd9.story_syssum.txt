Clunk!
Heywood was found dead last November in his hotel room in the sprawling southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing.
He moved in the orbit of a company known as Hakluyt and Co., a British strategic information consultancy formed by former officers of the UK's spy agency MI6.
Now, the British government is asking China to investigate Heywood's death.
Heywood's death on its own -- a man linked to former spies, a light drinker dead from apparent alcohol poisoning -- would be suspicious enough.
Bo Xilai is what is known as a "princeling," the son of a Maoist-era revolutionary hero.
But Bo also made enemies.
His right-hand man and former top cop Wang Lijun spectacularly sought refuge in an American consulate.
The Wall Street Journal, quoting anonymous diplomatic sources close to the case, reports Wang clashed with Bo after raising his suspicions that Heywood had been poisoned.
In a year of political transition in China, with a new generation of leaders poised to inherit power, the Bo case has captivated the country.
"This is a battle of the gods, not ordinary people," said one old man, who has seen leaders and revolution come and go.
Bo, the man who ran the criminals out of town, now finds himself ousted.
