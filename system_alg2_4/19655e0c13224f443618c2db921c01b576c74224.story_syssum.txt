(CNN) -- I rarely get to experience fine dining.
Most people don't know that.
All things considered, though, when I do get a chance to partake in a true quality meal at an upscale restaurant (read: when someone else is buying) I genuinely enjoy the odd experience of being served really small portions of elaborate food on really large elaborate plates, where 75 percent of the actual surface area is covered by tiny, elaborate flakes of garnish that, combined with the elaborate entrÃ©e, ultimately won't prevent me from just ordering pizza a few hours later when I get home so I can finally get to sleep all fat and bloated like I'm accustomed to.
And it's partly because people leave their kids at home.
This particular fine dining incident all started when the couple brought their 8-month-old baby into one of Chicago's swankiest restaurants, Alinea, which has the incredibly rare distinction of being awarded three stars by a renowned tire company.
The head chef of Alinea, Grant Achatz, later took to Twitter after diners began complaining when the aforementioned 8-month-old baby starting crying.
Tll ppl no kids?
Subject diners 2crying?
Not surprisingly, Achatz's tweet started a much larger conversation online where the general consensus was: Screw your kids.
I do.
It's just that ... they're also kind of sticky.
But I also understand what it's like NOT to have children.
But it's a line.
@AlineaBaby describes itself as ... a baby who likes fine food, fine drinks, and crying.
Now there's that.
And in response to the pop-up Twitter account for @AlineaBaby, he tweeted a photo of two giant fish heads and wrote: Definitely not baby food...
