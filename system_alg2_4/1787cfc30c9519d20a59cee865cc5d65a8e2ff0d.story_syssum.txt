The likes of Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) and Domino's pizza are opening up in African growth markets from Nigeria to Angola to give consumers a taste of U.S. cuisine.
And with growing political and economic stability, Western fast food brands are approaching the region with a renewed sense of optimism, according to Schulze.
In May, Burger King opened for business in South Africa and last year Domino's -- the U.S. pizza chain -- opened its first African store in Nigeria, the continent's most populous nation.
He added: "To compete in the market we have very competitive prices.
Across the continent Western brands remain high compared to other parts of the world, according to Schulze.
On average, the region is set to grow at more than 5% between 2013-15 as millions of new consumers emerge from poverty and commodity prices continue to rise, according to data from the World Bank.
The report also found Africans remain "exceptionally optimistic about their economic future" and very brand conscious in purchasing decisions.
