(CNN) -- The head of the company at the center of a toxic spill in Hungary has been arrested, accused of public endangerment and harming the environment, authorities said Monday.
Residents watched Monday as emergency workers and soldiers walked past in full biohazard suits.
"We have found a body near Kolontar that is likely to be the missing person, who would be the eighth victim," she told CNN.
The area has been evacuated, and soldiers were on standby Sunday, an official said.
The cracked wall is expected to collapse, Tottos told CNN on Sunday.
If the wall collapses, 500,000 cubic meters of toxic red sludge could spill out.
Orban, the prime minister, who was visiting the stricken area Saturday, said it was "very likely" the reservoir wall will collapse.
That's the reason why we pulled out ... all human lives from that area, in order not to have more loss in human life."
The pH, or acidity, level of the Danube water was 8.5 Friday -- slightly above normal but not dangerous and able to sustain life, Tottos said.
However, on Sunday she said that while saving lives is the priority, officials remain concerned about the long-term effects of the spill and want to protect Europe's waterways.
The aluminum company, MAL Co., said in a statement Saturday it was doing its utmost "to avoid further damages and to reinforce the injured deposit."
Orban warned Saturday of the "toughest possible consequences" for those responsible for the spill and said human error was the cause.
Dust from sludge that dries may also pose a threat, Hungary's Interior Ministry has said.
