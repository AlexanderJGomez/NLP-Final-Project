That's why March 14 -- 3-14 -- is Pi Day.
It is also involved in calculating the area of a circle, the volume of a sphere, and many other mathematical formulas you might need in the sciences.
Math may be scary, but pi is not -- as evidenced by the widespread revelry on Pi Day.
Even the House of Representatives supported the designation of March 14 as National Pi Day in 2009.
You could celebrate Pi Day in a casual way by grabbing a slice of pastry, or pizza.
Pi Day began as a small gathering with mostly museum staff.
The parade ends at the "pi shrine" -- a pi symbol with digits spiraling around it embedded in the sidewalk, which was unveiled last year.
Pi fans who have been spending the last year memorizing digits can show off and compete at the library, where the winner among 7- to 13-year-olds can take home a cool pi-hundred (That is, $314.15).
The "brainiac town" residents "love this event because it's a way for them to celebrate how quirky they are," said Mimi Omiecinski, owner of the Princeton Tour Company, who started Princeton Pi Day in 2009.
Along with her fascination with Albert Einstein, Omiecinski was inspired to launch a town-wide Pi Day after she heard that the Princeton University mathematics department celebrates March 14 with pie-eating and pi-reciting (As a Princeton student, I got second place for most digits in 2005 and 2006).
The Museum of Science in Boston has educational Pi Day events, and the Seattle Children's Museum will celebrate too.
David Blatner, author of the comprehensive book "The Joy of Pi," is hosting a Pi Day competition in which students from three classrooms will square off to see who can recite the most digits of pi from memory.
"People all around the world are hungry to make science and math fun and interesting," he said in an e-mail.
