(CNN) -- It was Taylor Anderson's dream come true to be living in Japan.
As a student at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Virginia, she constantly sought ways to share all things Japan with the community.
It was just her dream come true."
Her parents said she was last seen after the earthquake riding her bike away from an elementary school after making sure parents picked up their children.
"It is with deep regret that we inform you that earlier this morning we received a call from the U.S. Embassy in Japan that they had found our beloved Taylor's body," her family said in a statement.
Her exuberance for Japan permeated all aspects of her, her friends said.
"She was just so happy to be alive.
She always cared about other people more than herself.
She'll always be with us."
