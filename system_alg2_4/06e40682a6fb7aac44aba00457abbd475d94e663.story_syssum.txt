There aren't many NFL players who influenced the game like David "Deacon" Jones.
"Sacking a quarterback is just like you devastate a city or you cream a multitude of people.
The numbers alone tell the tale: The 6-foot-5-inch tall Jones piled up 173 sacks during a 14-year career with the Los Angeles Rams, the San Diego Chargers and the Redskins.
"Deacon Jones was one of the greatest players in NFL history," said Redskins General Manager Bruce Allen.
"Jones could split helmets with his head slap, and his outside speed rush was devastating," wrote Paul Zimmerman, aka Dr. Z, in Sports Illustrated.
As a Ram, Jones perfected the head slap.
So effective, the NFL banned it.
Nothing else," Wright said in the Sports Illustrated interview.
It was Deacon Jones."
