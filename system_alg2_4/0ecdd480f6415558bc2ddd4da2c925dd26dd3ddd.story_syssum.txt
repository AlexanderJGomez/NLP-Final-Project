John Couey had been sentenced to death for killing 9-year-old Jessica Lunsford in Florida in 2005.
"I never dreamed it would happen like this," Jessica's father, Mark Lunsford, told CNN.
"To me, death is sad," he said.
The girl was snatched from her bed in her family's Homosassa, Florida, home the evening of February 23, 2005, by Couey, a registered sex offender.
"I am not shedding any tears," the girl's grandmother, Ruth Lunsford, said on Wednesday.

Citrus County Sheriff Jeff Dawsy, who led the investigation into the girl's death, told reporters he wished Couey could have faced the death sentence handed down by the jury.
"I'm sorry I won't get to look him in the eyes as he died, but I'm relieved to know he'll never hurt another child again."
He told Lunsford he was planning to take her home, but did not want her to be seen, and so persuaded her to get into a trash bag.
Howard, at Couey's sentencing, brought many in the courtroom to tears as he discussed how the girl died slowly as her oxygen ran out.
"He caused a slow, suffering, conscious death," Howard said of Couey.
Although Lunsford's death was one of several that contributed to the passage of a federal child-protection law dealing with sex offender registration and other matters related to child sex offenses, Mark Lunsford said at the time of Couey's sentencing the law does not go far enough.

"I have bad news," Mark Lunsford said.
"You want to do something for her, give your life for the one you took."
