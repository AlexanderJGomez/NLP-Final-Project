(CNN) -- Hey Mars!
A car salesman would have a ball selling this beauty.
What can Mars tell us about our own planet?
Who will pay for the first manned mission to Mars?
"Back when the Internet was young, it was the largest Internet event in the history of that medium," Curiosity team member James Bell told CNN on Monday.
"It slammed NASA's website."
Curiosity "is just another box with wheels on Mars," says CNN commenter It_could_always_be_worse.
SEND PEOPLE, and I will be proud."
Seriously, no matter how successful unmanned missions might be, robots will never replace the need for human space exploration, says Bell.
In a sense, Curiosity is performing a scouting mission for a manned U.S. mission to Mars that President Barack Obama predicts will happen in his lifetime.
Putting a monetary value on space exploration is impossible, experts say, because there are too many unanswered questions, such as whether Mars, the moon or asteroids hold precious minerals, water and cheap energy resources that could be mined and brought back to Earth.
Scientists want to know what Mars can tell us about our own planet's climate and geology.
These stories become part of part of our culture, part of our heritage, part of our shared need to explore the worlds around us.
In 2017, NASA plans to launch Orion with a new heavy-lift rocket NASA calls the Space Launch System.
Or a vehicle for astronauts to travel on the Martian or lunar surface?
However, the budget also calls for more money for manned deep space programs, including almost $3 billion for Orion and the Space Launch System.
NASA is studying a proposal -- referred to as Red Dragon -- that would use a SpaceX rocket for less-expensive unmanned missions to Mars.
Do you think astronauts will set foot on Mars within your lifetime?
