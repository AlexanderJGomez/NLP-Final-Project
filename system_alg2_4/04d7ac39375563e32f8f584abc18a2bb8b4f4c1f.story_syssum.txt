A brazen attack on a serving soldier in the British army, brutally hacked to death in broad daylight in the southeast district of Woolwich, has sparked fear, anger and a search for answers -- but also moving tributes to the man who died.
"I live very close to where this happened and wanted to light a candle in remembrance for the soldier," she said.
Instagram user Jordan Rees posted an image of himself wearing the band both in sympathy and in protest against such attacks.
Meanwhile in Woolwich itself, resident Felix Rios captured a poignant image of a black flower placed at Woolwich Arsenal train station Thursday morning.
