Last week, Jack Taylor, a 5-foot, 10-inch guard at Iowa's Grinnell College, scored 138 points to lead Grinnell to a 179-104 blowout win over Faith Baptist Bible College, a nearby Iowa college.
Taylor is not the first basketball player to go on such an outsized scoring spree.
Francis made 38 of 70 shots and hit on 37 free throws in a game that ended with a 134-91 Rio Grande victory.
In the National Basketball Association, the scoring record belongs to the Philadelphia Warriors' Wilt Chamberlain.
That was not the case in the Grinnell game.
Faith Baptist Bible College's situation is very different.
What the basketball players at Faith Baptist Bible College must be feeling about losing by 75 points doesn't seem to have entered anyone's head at Grinnell or in the media, which couldn't get enough of Taylor in the days following his scoring feat.
We stopped taking long shots that would get our supporters cheering, and with the game in hand, we brought in the second team, and after them, anyone still on the bench.
We knew these unspoken rules by 16.
But I wish that the Grinnell players had had my old coach, who doubled as my math teacher.
