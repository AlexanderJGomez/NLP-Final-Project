That is how President Obama should begin one of the most significant speeches of his presidency: the commencement address at Morehouse College this Sunday.
Now, however, comes the time to be explicit: to speak out loud his affiliation, his fraternal pride and concern.
In a Father's Day talk at a black church in Chicago, he criticized "too many fathers" for "acting like boys not men."
In urban areas, fewer than half graduate from high school.
Nobody understands, like this audience will, the contortions a successful African-American man has to make to fit in but stand out, to be strong but not intimidate or frighten, to be black enough but not too black.
Politically it was not the smartest thing to say (the LGBT community didn't turn Obama into the most gay friendly president in U.S. history by going easy on him) but any black man could understand the sentiment.
The president isn't the only black man who needs to step up support of his brothers.
The government's primary intervention for black men is to lock them up.
President Obama cannot, on his own, reverse this course, but he can do much more than he has to disrupt the flow of the one in three young black men who are headed to prison.
Barack Obama was once a young black man who smoked pot, and it would be surprising if he actually believes that it's fair for other young black men to be selectively prosecuted for that.
What a difference it might make for the millions of black boys who now are headed to destinies very different from graduating from Morehouse College or becoming president of the United States.
