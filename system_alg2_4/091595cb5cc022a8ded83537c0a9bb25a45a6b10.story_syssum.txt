Bright lights and performance tents filled with adoring fans.
But for Joe Putignano, it wasn't as simple as running away -- it took a lifetime of dedication and a battle against addiction to get where he is today: dangling from the 40-foot-high catwalk above the Cirque du Soleil big top.
And for Joe, it's not just high-flying acrobatics that cause him pain.
"Sleeping hurts a lot, because I'm rolling over on my shoulder.
"I need to have surgery," he says matter-of-factly.
His left shoulder has just the one injury -- another SLAP tear.
"I suppose there's always a risk that when they do fix it, that it will destroy my flexibility," Joe says.
"Opiates made me feel like I was the greatest human being possible.
Joe's fears aren't unfounded.
He's determined to not let it become his reality, both for his own benefit, and to show other addicts they don't have to fear a day where they need surgery.
Most of these nearly 17 million Americans will need surgery someday, and many of them will be prescribed opioid painkillers to combat post-operative pain.
There is one problem -- Spektor says nerve blocks are usually inserted while the patient is awake to make sure they're placed properly.
"In my head, it's like -- OK, we're going to go and visit hell, not just once, but twice," he said.
"I think every patient is unique," Spektor says.
"But I think Joe has an incredibly good psychological framework going on.
I'm jumping into a freezing cold pool, and I don't know how I'm gonna react," he said days before the surgery.
When you're met with pain, only then you'll know how you'll react to it."
