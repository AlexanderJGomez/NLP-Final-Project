Raul Ochoa of Richmond, California, would spend the next 22 years in prison under a plea deal in which the victim won't be compelled to testify at the sentencing hearing on February 11, authorities said.
In the Richmond case, the victim escaped from captivity in 2012 with help from a relative, who brought her to police, Richmond Police Chief Chris Magnus said in a letter to the city council, confirming a local newspaper account this week of the crime.
The girl was taken captive in 1998 at age 13, Deputy District Attorney Ryan Wagner told CNN.
At the time, she was visiting Ochoa in his family's home, according to CNN affiliate KGO and authorities.
The girl wasn't allowed to attend school, and as she became older, Ochoa taught her how to do landscaping work, an activity they shared, authorities told the affiliate.
Police arrested Ochoa after having the victim place a phone call to him, Hill said.
One neighbor told KGO that she always sensed something was not right at the Ochoa house.
No one has the right to do this to a person."
"Although I can't get into all the details, it would have been SO easy for them to have interacted with this victim and never figured out what was really going on," the chief wrote.
Ochoa, who pleaded guilty to one count of forced lewd acts on a child and two counts of forcible rape, is now being held on $30 million bond, according to a detention facility in Contra Costa County.
