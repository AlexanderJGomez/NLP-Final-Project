Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Thousands packed Havana's Revolution Square on Saturday for International Workers' Day, drawing hordes of Cuban demonstrators, spectators, and trade unionists from around the world -- including the United States and the United Kingdom.
Since then, neither Castro has made a major speech on May Day.
He began the strike to demand better prison conditions.
Saturday marked the second International Workers' Day since U.S. President Obama took office.
Saturday's May Day march began around 8 a.m. and lasted roughly two hours without incident.
