LONDON, England (CNN) -- When Danish auteur Lars von Trier presented his gothic thriller, "Antichrist" at Cannes Film Festival last month, it was greeted with cat-calls, jeers and, at times, disbelieving laughter.
Misogyny couldn't be further from the truth, according to Von Trier, who says he sees himself up there on the screen: "I mostly see myself as the female character," the 53-year-old director told CNN in Cannes.
Do you think that Lars von Trier is a woman-hater?
"I think that if you are, shall we say, sensitive, then there is a good side and a bad side about it," said von Trier.
He has been nominated for the top prize at Cannes, the Palme D'Or, a staggering eight times, winning once in 2000 for the harrowing operatic tragedy, "Dancer in the Dark," starring Icelandic musician, Bjork, who also took home the Best Actress prize that year.
Von Trier claimed each morning she would say "Mr von Trier, I despise you," and spit at him.
"I was scared," admitted Gainsbourg who won Best Actress at Cannes for her performance.
He also seems to actively court controversy: 1998 Palme D'Or contender "Dogme #2: The Idiots" grabbed headlines for being the first commercial film to show non-simulated sex on screen, and for von Trier's typically eccentric claim that the best way to prepare actors for sex scenes is to direct in the nude.
But, von Trier says, he has always taken a deeply personal approach to the experimental, often dark and challenging works that he creates.
