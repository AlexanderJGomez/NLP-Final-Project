(CNN) -- Over the past couple of weeks, I have been asking random people who identify as Republicans if they trust Mitt Romney, and each of them gave me an answer like this -- "I trust him more than I trust Obama."
They know he flip flops.
And yet, their dislike of President Barack Obama is so strong that they're willing to overlook that whole character thing and swallow the bitter pill that is Romney.
He hasn't.
This is why some Republicans are willing to vote for a guy they may not trust: He's viewed as the lesser of two evils.
Here's the thing: The question of trusting Mitt Romney has nothing to do with Barack Obama.
Many conservative pundits, including George Will, say Romney's math -- where it exists -- is a bit fuzzy and all Romney can say is "trust me."
Because if he wins, saying "I trust him more than I trust Obama" is not going to help matters in January.
And yet, he won't trust us to even look at his.
Obama has only kept 37% of his promises.
Which I guess is why many Republicans have a hard time saying they do.
