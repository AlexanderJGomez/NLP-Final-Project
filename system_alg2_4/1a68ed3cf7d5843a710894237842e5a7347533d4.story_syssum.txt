Beach volleyball players, particularly Olympians, are known all around the world for their incredible skill with the ball.
The tape has been around for decades, but during the London 2012 Olympics, it has been spotted stretching and spiraling in interesting patterns on some athletes.
With its Olympic popularity, athletic trainers say you can bet you will see a lot more of the tape at your local gym or on the playing field this year.
Because the tape is thin and pliable, it's different from athletic tape used on ankles or wrists, he says.
According to Adam Halpern, education director for Kinesio, Kase's patients kept telling him they felt great in his office, but the impact of his healing hands would diminish after a while.
To think he just had an idea and created a product that serves practitioners and is used at the highest level of athletic competition in the world, well, you know why he was smiling."
The company has trained more than 100,000 practitioners around the world on how to use the tape, Halpern says.
When people see athletes who are doing so well, they think, 'Maybe this could work for me,'" he says.
Robin Rogers, an Atlanta runner who is also a massage therapist for athletes, says he's a fan of the tape.
Rogers says he hasn't used the tape in any races yet.
"I have hamstring issues and I kept trying it, but the stuff just wouldn't stick to me," she says.
It's pretty-colored cotton tape."
