"With planning and the right investments in people now ... our world of 7 billion can have thriving, sustainable cities, productive labor forces that can fuel economic growth, youth populations that contribute to the well-being of economies and societies, and a generation of older people who are healthy and actively engaged in the social and economic affairs of their communities," UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, said in a new report.
A U.N. report published in May predicts a global population of 9.3 billion by 2050, and more than 10 billion by the end of this century.
In 1927, the global population was 2 billion.
It was only 13 years ago that the population was at 6 billion, the United Nations says.
But there are far more women than there were in the 1960s.
--Today there are 893 million people over the age of 60; by the middle of the century, that number will rise to 2.4 billion.
