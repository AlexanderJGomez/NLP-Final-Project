(CNN) -- The European Union has barred the import of certain seeds from Egypt after Egyptian fenugreek seeds were linked to deadly outbreaks of E. coli in France and Germany.
The contamination of the fenugreek seeds "probably occurred before the seeds left the importer," the European Commission cites the EFSA report as saying.
The recent European outbreaks from a strain of E. coli have led to 48 deaths in Germany and one in Sweden, the EFSA said, with 4,178 cases reported in European Union states, Norway and Switzerland.
Most seeds for sprouting imported by the EU come from India and China, it said.
