WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Officials investigating last week's crash of two Metro subway trains said a system used to detect trains in the area of the accident had failed intermittently in the days immediately before the fatal crash.
The NTSB says the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority reported the problem during a post-accident review of track circuit data, but it was not immediately clear if operators were aware of the problem before the accident.
Nine people were killed in the June 22 accident.
Since the accident, the transit authority has stopped using a computer system designed to avoid collisions and is operating the trains manually, leading to delays.
