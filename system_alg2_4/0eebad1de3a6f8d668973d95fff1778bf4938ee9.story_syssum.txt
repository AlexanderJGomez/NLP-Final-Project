The typhoon, known locally as "Glenda," prompted the evacuations of as many as 350,000 people from their homes in towns and cities across the country.
The Council added that there were ten people injured, and eight remained missing.
Fears over storm surges eased as the typhoon began to move away from the city, weakening from a Category 2 storm to a Category 1, with maximum sustained winds of about 150 kilometers per hour.
He said that, at that time, more than an inch of rain was falling per hour in the city, many areas of which are susceptible to flooding.
According to a statement from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the typhoon was expected to affect 43 million people spread across 22 provinces.
Infrastructure also suffered, with 15 roads and four bridges becoming impassable.
It was expected to be of Category 2 strength but upon hitting land turned into a Category 3 storm, with sustained winds of 205 kilometers per hour.
The storm cut across the main island of the Philippines, hitting numerous population centers across southern and central Luzon.
Rammasun is the first to hit since last year's Typhoon Haiyan killed more than 6,250 people, left more than 1,000 missing and caused widespread destruction.
