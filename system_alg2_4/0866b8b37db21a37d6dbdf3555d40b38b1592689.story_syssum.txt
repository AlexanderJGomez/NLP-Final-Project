Los Angeles (CNN) -- Chris Brown must stay locked up in the Los Angeles County jail for at least another week while his lawyer negotiates with the prosecutor about his probation violation, a judge said Thursday.
Geragos said he would also file a motion to have Brown released from jail, which would be considered at the May 9 hearing.
U.S.
The prosecutor said last week that she would "strenuously object" to Brown being released because it appears likely Brown will be found guilty of the assault charge in Washington.
The Washington judge who found his bodyguard guilty in the assault case also concluded that Brown was "the initial aggressor" in the incident, Murray said.
"I think it's a little over the top to have him in custody on this misdemeanor when everybody saw the bodyguard's trial and which was nothing more than a bloody nose," Brown lawyer Mark Geragos told reporters in Washington last week.
On Monday, Hollosy was found guilty of assaulting a man on a Washington sidewalk before Brown's trial was to begin in the case.
