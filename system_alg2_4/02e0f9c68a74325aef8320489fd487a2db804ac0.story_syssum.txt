"Well jeez," Jobs said, struggling to get the spanking new iPhone 4 to do much of anything without a connection to a Wi-Fi network.
Many tech bloggers and writers have called for Apple to open the iPhone to other networks, including Verizon Wireless.
Any AT&T customer eligible for a phone upgrade this year can get the iPhone 4 on its debut date at those subsidized prices, Jobs said.
After the event, tech industry analysts warned against reading too much into the network glitches during Jobs' presentation.
Analysts said Jobs was having trouble connecting to a Wi-Fi network during his presentation, not AT&T's troubled 3G network.
Van Baker, research vice-president for Gartner, said the "Verizon!"
If the attendees didn't comply, he said, he would simply not be able to show off the rest of the iPhone 4's new features, including its higher-resolution screen, improved camera and video chat functionality -- which, by the way, is only available over Wi-Fi.
