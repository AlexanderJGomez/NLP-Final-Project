Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Kepler Meo isn't nervous.
Michael Kepler Meo is just 12 years old.
Los Angeles Opera Music Director James Conlon briefly peeks into the dressing room to wish young Meo good luck.
Michael won the role of Miles, a troubled boy threatened by menacing ghosts in a rambling English country home.
Conlon says only a handful of boys are capable of taking on operatic roles.
Meo says she isn't sure where Michael came by his musical talent.
"I don't have too much contact with kids my age," Michael says.
"He is lucky that he found something that he is so good at at so young an age," says his mom.
What then?
"In opera you can sing even if you are old."
