ET to "Campbell Brown" over the next two nights to find out who else will fill the slots.
Officials say Joe Saenz is thought to be linked with Mexican drug cartels.
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Detective Traci Gonzales knew there were drug and gang ties to the slaying, so she showed the videotape to Los Angeles Police Department Detective Ron Chavarria, a veteran on the gang beat.
Saenz is the newest person on the FBI's Most Wanted List, after three fugitives on the list were recently caught.
He was wanted for shooting and killing two rival gang members at a housing complex in the Hollenbeck area of Los Angeles.
Within days, Saenz -- also known as Jose Saenz, Louie Louie and more than two dozen other aliases -- was wanted for a third murder.
"He's believed to be linked with the cartels in Mexico, bringing large amounts of narcotics into the Los Angeles area, Garriola said.
He's eluded police for years, and has reportedly made statements that he plans to kill a police officer if they ever find him and arrest him, according to the FBI's Most Wanted Web site.
The chilling video, Chavarria said, shows why Saenz is so dangerous.
