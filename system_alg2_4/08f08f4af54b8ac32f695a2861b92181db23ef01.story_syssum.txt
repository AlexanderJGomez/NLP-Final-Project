But for Game of Thrones author George R.R.
Martin: I knew it almost from the beginning.
I killed Ned because everybody thinks he's the hero and that, sure, he's going to get into trouble, but then he'll somehow get out of it.
The next predictable thing is to think his eldest son is going to rise up and avenge his father.
As The Boy recently said on Thrones, "If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention."
It's two-thirds of the way through the book, but I skipped over it when I came to it.
I try to make the readers feel they've lived the events of the book.
Robb wasn't one of your "viewpoint characters" in the books and Catelyn wasn't really a beloved personality.
There's a certain amount of foreboding leading up to it.
It's at a wedding feast.
There's also secondary characters killed.
And Catelyn has suffered so much and lost so many people around her, and she actually thinks she's lost more than she really has (since she doesn't know for sure that Arya, Bran and Rickon are alive).
And she does.
Martin: No.
It's going to be hard for me to watch it [on the show].
And in a TV show you get to know the actors.
People read books for different reasons.
And you read that certain kind of fiction where the guy will always get the girl and the good guys win and it reaffirms to you that life is fair.
So I'm not dismissive of people who want that.
I think the best fiction captures life in all its light and darkness.
It's like you're smacking the reader upside the head for being so dense â€” "Of course they're not going to follow that silly rule ALL the time!"
EW: What about the Red Wedding itself?
The Red Wedding is based on a couple real events from Scottish history.
Then at the end of the feast, [the king's men] started pounding on a single drum.
They brought out a covered plate and put it in front of the Earl and revealed it was the head of a black boar â€” the symbol of death.
No matter how much I make up, there's stuff in history that's just as bad, or worse.
