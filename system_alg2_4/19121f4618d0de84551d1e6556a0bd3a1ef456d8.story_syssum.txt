(CNN) -- Be kind to fans of "The Good Wife" today.
The Kings, who launched the acclaimed drama in 2009, say in an open letter addressed to their "loyal" audience that their focus has always been on "the education of" Julianna Margulies' character, Alicia Florrick, a lawyer whose life was thrown into turmoil after her husband's corruption scandal.
"To us, there always was a tragedy at the center of Will and Alicia's relationship: the tragedy of bad timing," the Kings said.
Well, the Kings say, "we've all experienced the sudden death of a loved one in our lives.
'The Good Wife' is a show about human behavior and emotion, and death, as sad and unfair as it can be, is a part of the human experience that we want to share."
