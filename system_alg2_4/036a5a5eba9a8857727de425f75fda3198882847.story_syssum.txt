With the English Channel tunnel, trains speed from Big Ben to the Eiffel Tower in about 2.5 hours.
More travelers now connect London and Paris by train than by air -- and high-speed rail between these two cities may get even faster and cheaper in the near future.
In the 15 years that the bullet train has been running, not much has changed except London's Eurostar station -- it's now St. Pancras International (in Paris it stops at Gare du Nord; in Brussels it's Midi Station).
Air France will use the same tracks, but says its trains could run faster than Eurostar's (a claim that Eurostar disputes).
Fares can change without notice, but typically a one-way, full-fare ticket (with no restrictions on refunds) runs about $425 first-class and $300 second-class.
Unlike our cheapo airlines, you can take two large bags and one small day bag per person for no extra fee.
When you're ready to ride, you'll find the process is similar to an airport check-in -- without all the drama, sole-baring shoe inspections, and waiting.
As you zoom along at speeds up to 185 miles per hour, consider how long it took to link Britain and France.
Voila!
High-tech know-how, a shared European vision, and people's love of travel have created incredibly fast trains that crisscross, link and strengthen Europe.
