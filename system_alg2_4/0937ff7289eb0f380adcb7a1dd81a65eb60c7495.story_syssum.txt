Nine other countries, together accounting for more than half the euro area's GDP, were downgraded at least one notch.
The average fiscal deficit for the euro area was only about 4% of GDP in 2011.
Italy -- hit with a two-notch downgrade -- is actually expected to structurally balance its 2012 budget.
There are enough savings within the monetary union area to finance all public deficits of the eurozone's members.
This is because euro area savers are usually loath to invest in foreign currency; and most regulated intermediaries such as investment fund have little choice but to invest in government securities in euro.
But the area's investors dare not cross the Alps to spend their money in the southern countries such as Italy, Spain and Greece (and maybe soon France).
The collection of savings within national pools means the capital markets have ceased to function in the euro area.
The ECB cannot single-handedly substitute for all private cross border lending.
The fiscal compact might be useful to prevent the next crisis a generation down the road, but this will not be very useful if the euro does not survive the present one.
