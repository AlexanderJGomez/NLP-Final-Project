(CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday a closed Texas food processing plant tested positive for a bacteria that has been linked to the deaths of four people.
Six of those cases -- in Bexar, Travis and Hidalgo counties -- were linked to chopped celery processed at the SanGar plant, the state health services department said.
It said it found the bacteria in processed celery and in multiple locations in the plant, including food contact surfaces.
"The FDA and the state have not turned over to us the documentation supporting their findings," Galvan said.
"We're not going the litigation route."
State health inspectors said they believe the bacteria found in the chopped celery may have contaminated other products at the company's plant.
Besides the bacteria, inspectors found a condensation leak above a food product area, dirt on a food-preparation table, and hand-washing problems at the San Antonio plant, the state health department said.
The Texas health department is taking the lead in the investigation, with assistance from the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC.
