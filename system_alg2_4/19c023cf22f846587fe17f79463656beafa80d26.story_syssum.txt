As many as 20,000 people were expected at the Put People First march, organized by trade unions but backed by some 120 other groups including environmentalists, church groups, and political campaigners.
The Salvation Army, which helped organize the service, said it was a "perfect opportunity to ask the G-20 to consider the world's most vulnerable people."
Speakers at the rally include trade union bosses, environmentalists, and global justice campaigners, along with musicians and a comedian, according to march organizers.
Jake Corn, from Cambridge, told the UK's Press Association he was taking part to show support for a more sustainable future.
He said: "We are here to try and make a better world and protest against the G-20."
