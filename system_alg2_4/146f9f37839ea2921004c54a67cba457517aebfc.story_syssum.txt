Daryn Webb had a plan, and for someone intent on "riding" a fridge down the side of an active volcano, a great deal of optimism might be assumed too.
Perhaps it wasn't sturdy enough for high-velocity volcano travel, or perhaps there was a disappointing, crawling end to the journey.
Perhaps because his home was getting a little breezy and running low on appliances, he eventually gathered some tools and wood and knocked up the world's very first volcano board, later to belt down the same volcano with more success.
hollers Jessie, our dreadlocked guide from Quebec, as she motions to a mass of pale rocks, beneath which steam leaks out into the thick air.
Since its birth in 1850 it has erupted 23 times, the last in 1999 just before the sport of volcano boarding took hold.
This is probably the only place in the world you can book a tour to go volcano boarding.
"To our knowledge, volcano boarding is only possible on Cerro Negro," says Timothy Brauning of the Bigfoot tour company, which leads volcano boarding trips.
The city of Leon is below too, the country's largest after the capital, and launching point for tours like this by Bigfoot.
"Who's up?"
The girl and board crawl off with a sound of wood crunching rock, then momentum builds and she's soon just a soft orange mote chased by a smoky scar, like a jet trail.
Then I'm up.
I see the spill coming in plenty of time though, and I pull the volcano boarding equivalent of the ejector seat, hurling myself sideways.
I rejoin the board, take a second to drink in the vista from a new level, halfway down, and push off for a second time.
On the ride back to Leon I give silent thanks to the inspired people of the world: the ones whose minds run off on all manner of daring tangents, like the flanks of Cerro Negro.
Volcano boarding can be booked through various local companies including Bigfoot based in Leon.
Tours run most days, year round, weather permitting.
