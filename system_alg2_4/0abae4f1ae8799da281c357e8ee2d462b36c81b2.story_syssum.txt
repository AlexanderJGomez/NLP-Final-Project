Among the dead was a 12-year-old boy shot to death when Syrian security forces fired on a funeral procession, according to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights..
The number of people killed in unrest in Syria since mid-March has reached at least 2,600, the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said Monday.
Mattar was arrested along with leading opposition activist Yahya Sharbaji and a number of other activists, Nuland said.
"His death is an attack by the regime on peace.
On September 6, Mattar was with Sharbaji when he received a call from Sharbaji's brother saying he was injured and needed help, according to the friend.
Unrest has plagued Syria for more than six months, as protesters demanding more freedom, democratic elections and an end to al-Assad's regime have been met by brute force.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Syria, freezing assets of specific regime members and banning Americans from doing business with the country.
The Syrian Observatory has said more than 2,000 people -- mostly demonstrators -- have died since the uprising began in mid-March.
Mattar's colleague said that Syrian security forces fired on mourners, and that one man was shot and later died.
