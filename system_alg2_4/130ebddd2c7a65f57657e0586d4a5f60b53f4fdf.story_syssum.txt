While literally adding a new dimension to cinema-goers' experience, 3D is also being touted as a means to help filmmakers reach new creative heights, make millions of dollars for Hollywood studios and curb the scourge of the industry -- piracy.
"We've really gone past the point of seeing the technology as a barrier," Phil 'Captain 3D' McNally told CNN.
"The challenge now is 100 years of experience in how to make movies in 2D," said McNally, speaking of a movie industry that has spent its existence flattening the 3D of real life for the silver screen.
"There's going to be great filmmakers that are going to deliver experiences like you've never seen before," said Jason Clark, a motion picture producer who helped launch Dreamworks' 3D foray and worked on "Monster House" and "Stuart Little," the first time a photorealistic character was spliced into a live action movie.
"The way I experience life is handheld.
3D is the way we experience life."
"3D right now is at its infant stages."
Digital projection is "rock steady" and could define how different generations take on 3D, said Clark.
"But kids, it's all new to them, and they haven't had the painful experience of watching misaligned 3D in the 1970's, the 1980's, and the 1990's.
The United States will have around 3,000 3D screens by the end of this year when "Avatar" is scheduled for release, according to the National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO).
"No one knows right now how big the market will be," Corcoran told CNN.
"If you are really determined, you can make a copy of anything," said McNally, suggesting that 3-D movies could be recorded through the same kind of lenses used in 3-D glasses, but pirates would have to be "pretty serious" to pull it off.
3D promises to deliver a unique experience in theatres that could allow Hollywood to take something back.
And that's something that can't be replicated in the home," Corcoran said.
