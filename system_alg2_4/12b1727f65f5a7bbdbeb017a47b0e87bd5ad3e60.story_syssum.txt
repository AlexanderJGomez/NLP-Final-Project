(CNN) -- An anonymous video that appears to show several police officers torturing young male suspects in Argentina has outraged many people in the South American country.
They are surrounded by several men in civilian clothes who are apparently the police officers implicated in the case.
The men in civilian clothes are shown pouring water on the suspects.
The interrogator takes the bag off his head and the suspect is seen on the floor gasping for air.
The police source said officials believe the video was shot by one of the arrested officers.
The two suspects had been detained for misdemeanors and were freed soon after the incident, the source said.
"Torture is a common tool which is applied constantly in many detention centers and even to suspects held at police station cells before their court appearance," Verdu said.
