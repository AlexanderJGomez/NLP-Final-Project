Istanbul (CNN) -- The Turkish prime minister huddled Wednesday with a special Syrian envoy in an effort to help stem the growing tide of refugees racing into Turkey from conflict-wracked Syria.
"It is impossible for us to remain indifferent to the developments there," Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said.
In its draft joint statement about Syria, the U.N. Human Rights Council noted that more than 1,000 people "peacefully protesting for democracy" have been killed.
He planned to attend the meeting between Erdogan and the Syrian envoy after his visit to Hatay.
That policy has been challenged by the Syrian situation.
Of the refugees, 4,368 are children, and 73 Syrians are now being treated in Turkish hospitals, the emergency directorate said.
Turkish Foreign Ministry officials confirmed that they accepted an application for actress Angelina Jolie to visit the Syrian refugees in Hatay.
Many of the refugees have fled from a region that includes the northwestern town of Jisr al-Shugur, seized by the Syrian military over the weekend, a network of human rights activists said.
Wissam Tarif, a human rights activist based outside Syria, said he had not received reports of people returning to their homes.
Tarif said he had received no report that the people of Jisr al-Shugur were returning to their homes.
In its joint draft joint statement on Syria, the Human Rights Council called on Syria to implement reforms and end censorship and restrictions on media.
