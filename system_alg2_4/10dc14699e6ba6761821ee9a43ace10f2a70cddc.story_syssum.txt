But no shots were fired when Mexican federal police captured alleged Juarez Cartel boss Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, authorities said Thursday.
But once he realized he'd been found out, Carrillo Fuentes admitted who he was, Rubido said.
There were five arrest warrants for his capture in Mexico, where authorities were offering a reward of 30 million pesos ($2.2 million).
But at one time, the Juarez Cartel was one of the most powerful in Mexico.
Critics accuse local authorities of involvement in the grisly crime, and say the government hasn't done enough to solve it.
Hours later at another press conference, Murillo trumpeted news of Carrillo Fuentes' capture as the "result of enormous effort by the federal government," noting that it shows how much authorities have strengthened their abilities in investigation and intelligence.
