The Discovery Channel recently premiered "Kurt Sutter's Outlaw Empires," a six-part series that looks at the micro and macro reasons behind groups that have defined their existence outside the law.
"On 'Sons,' we exposed a lot of people to a new world," Sutter told CNN from Los Angeles.
The show sprang from a different concept Sutter was pitching that looked at criminal activity from two points of view, the criminals and law enforcement.
"Outlaw Empires" explores case studies of a few people involved in the criminal organization, using their stories and knowledge to make larger connections to the context of the outlaw group.
For him, they started small and worked outward.
"We tapped into people that had relationships; some of these guys have been cleaning up their acts -- there's networks to get to these people," Sutter said.
And like the way he portrays his fictional characters, he aims to give viewers a new look at a group of people who have been largely portrayed in a certain way.
"You try to go in and give it some context, so people have some point of view to why people did what they did.
But you can't write them so deplorable that the audience can't get behind them.
"Kurt Sutter's Outlaw Empires" airs at 10 p.m.
