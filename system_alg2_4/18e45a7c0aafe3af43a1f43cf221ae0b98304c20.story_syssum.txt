The violence occurred shortly before the match, but the game between Zamalek and ENPPI  teams continued,  Al-Ahram newspaper said.
Shortly after the incident, soccer fans traded accusations with the Interior Ministry, which blamed the violence on riots from ticketless fans who tried to push their way in.
The security forces tried to disperse them, the fans fled to the main road and blocked traffic and stopped the bus carrying the Zamalek soccer team," the ministry said in a statement.
Meanwhile, the Cabinet has suspended the nation's premier league matches  indefinitely.
After that incident, Egypt banned soccer fans from games.
