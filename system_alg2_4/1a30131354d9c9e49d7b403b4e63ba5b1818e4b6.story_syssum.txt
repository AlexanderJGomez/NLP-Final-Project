ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN)  -- A suspected U.S. missile from an unmanned drone killed three people Saturday in Pakistan's tribal region, according to a Pakistani military source and a North Waziristan official.
The U.S-led coalition and NATO -- based in Afghanistan -- have been seeking a way to effectively battle Taliban and al Qaeda militants who they believe are launching attacks from Pakistan's swath of tribal areas along the border.
North Waziristan is one of seven districts within Pakistan's ungoverned tribal region along the Afghanistan border.
In October, the Foreign Ministry summoned Patterson and said strikes should be stopped immediately.
