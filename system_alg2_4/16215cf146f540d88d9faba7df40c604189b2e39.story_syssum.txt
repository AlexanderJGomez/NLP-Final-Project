San Antonio, Texas (CNN) -- The case of the New Mexico hotelier who required Latino employees to adopt English names and avoid speaking Spanish at work reminds us of the need for balance as we grapple with cultural evolution in America.
I didn't speak English yet, having been home with my mom up until that first day of kindergarten.
My journey as an American began.
She ran Sunnyside in a modest house she'd once called home.
And that was that.
I didn't mind "Rudy" but I didn't like "Ruiz" pronounced in English.
"Rudy" in English.
Balance.
Meanwhile at school, I gobbled up books and determined to someday head north to Harvard and make my way as a productive American.
And all along, as I introduced myself, I started my name in English and switched gears into Spanish for the second half.
And the alliteration of "Rudy Ruiz" provided a challenge in that the "r" in Rudy flows smoothly in English, while the "r" in Ruiz rolls like a locomotive thundering over the old railway bridge that spans the Rio Grande in Brownsville, often backing up traffic for miles.
Four letters in English.
Balance.
Surely, it's no surprise that when a child finds challenge in something as simple as their name, he or she will likely also face a complex path in crafting an identity as a multicultural American.
The key to attaining the right balance is empathy.
Just like my name.
