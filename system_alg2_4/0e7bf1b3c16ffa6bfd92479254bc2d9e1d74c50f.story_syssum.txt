Kevin Systrom, co-founder of photo sharing site Instagram, said this week he wants to give his users better access to their older images.
One of those people is Phil Libin, CEO of Evernote, a service that allows users to archive images, documents and other data.
Libin made headlines at tech conference LeWeb London this week when he revealed that Evernote has 34 million users, of whom 1.4 million are paying customers -- up sharply from the 25 million users and 1 million paying customers he had announced in May.
"We want people to have to believe that Evernote will be around for 100 years," Libin told CNN.
"As soon as 10 years go by when it hasn't been in anyone's economic interest to keep your data, you can almost be guaranteed you won't be able to get it back.
Delicious still exists today and may continue to thrive long into the future.
"The main technology challenge is what format will be available in 100 years?"
"There's no magical technology solution -- it's not like we have a file format that someone will be able to read in 100 years," he added.
But Libin, and Evernote, are trying.
