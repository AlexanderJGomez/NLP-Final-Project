The first person murdered in retaliation for the 9/11 attacks was a Sikh -- a gas station owner in Mesa, Arizona, named Balbir Singh Sodhi who was shot five times by aircraft mechanic Frank Roque.
As the incidents waned, the community had hoped the worst was behind them -- until Sunday, when a man shot and killed at least six people at a Sikh temple outside Milwaukee, wounded a police officer and was himself killed by another officer's bullets.
Rajwant Singh, from the Maryland-Sikh Council on Religion and Education, said Sikhs growing up in the United States should not feel as though they don't belong.
"Everybody should feel at home," he said Sunday.
"But we are different people from Muslim people.
He asked that the FBI update its Hate Crime Incident Report Form (1-699), which does not have a designation for crimes against Sikhs as it does for some other groups.
-- September 15, 2001: Roque guns down Sodhi outside a Mesa gas station.
-- July 2004: Rajinder Singh Khalsa is beaten unconscious by six men in New York City, after they taunt him and his friend about their turban.
The attacker later tells police he wanted to "kill a Taliban."
-- January 2009: Jasmir Singh is attacked outside a New York grocery store, with men shouting racial slurs.
Sikhism, the world's fifth most popular religion, is a monotheistic faith that believes in equality and service to others, Sikh officials say.
