(CNN) -- As captain of the Neptune tugboat, Viktor Nikolsky spends his days gently directing giant cargo vessels in and around the vast port of St. Petersburg, Russia.
Nikolsky hesitates when recalling the moment he realized armed bandits were fast approaching his ship off the coast of Somalia.
"When they saw what kind of cargo they were surprised," Nikolsky said.
A U.S. Navy ship kept watch of the Faina from a distance while pirates patrolled the decks.
This meant Nikolsky was in command when the pirates attacked.
"The crew was under control all the time.
Nikolsky said his heart sank at this moment.
They left, and the ship and crew free to go.
He told us that everything was clear and all the pirates left the vessel."
"Sometimes when I dream I see the very clear water and my ship moving over the clear water in open sea," he said.
"But I spent at sea all of my life, 45 years ... (and) now I like my village, I like my job here."
