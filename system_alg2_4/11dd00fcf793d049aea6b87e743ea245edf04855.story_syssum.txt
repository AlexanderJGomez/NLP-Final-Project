(CNN)Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said his office has received death threats since his controversial comments accusing President Barack Obama of not loving America.
"I don't regret making the statement.
I believe it," Giuliani said.
A spokesman for the Louisiana governor confirms Jindal did speak with Giuliani by phone.
While the spokesman said Jindal did not endorse everything the former mayor said about Obama, he added the governor also has deep concerns about the president's leadership on Islamist radicalism.
John Catsimatidis, a tycoon in the grocery store industry who sponsored the event, also called to say Giuliani was saying what was on other people's minds, the former mayor added.
"I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the President loves America.
In his latest comments to CNN, Giuliani noted he is not running for president in 2016.
"I think the President is a very poor leader," Giuliani added, saying Obama doesn't measure up to past presidents Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton.
Giuliani said the White House owes him an apology after stating that he had made similar remarks about Obama during the 2008 campaign.
"And the truth is, I don't take any joy, or vindication, or satisfaction from that.
