Shouldn't you find out if you have cancer and then decide whether to treat it?
In one of Ray Bradbury's most famous short stories, "The Skeleton," the lead character goes insane after becoming obsessed with the fact that he has something foreign and frightening inside himself.
In the case of heart disease, there is only the failure of something we've always had ticking away inside us.
Much has been written recently about why people are so upset over the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation to abandon the current practice of routinely screening healthy men for prostate cancer.
To understand the mental health implications of this idea we have to take a step back and ask why abandoning the PSA test would improve our society's health.
This means that many people with a positive test will turn out not to have prostate cancer.
In this situation it poses no health risk.
In this case the PSA test does no material good.
Why?
The cost of this knowledge would be especially high for those already predisposed to mood and anxiety disorders as a result of a tendency to worry, to ruminate, to focus too greatly on their health.
So from a mental health perspective, it seems to me the guidelines around PSA testing are clear: To continue PSA testing in low-risk individuals will significantly increase mental health morbidity if treatment guidelines change such that prostate cancers are not routinely removed.
For medically healthy men, prostate screening is truly a situation in which ignorance is bliss.
