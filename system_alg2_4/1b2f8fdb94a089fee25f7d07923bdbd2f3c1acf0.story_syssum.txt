The central government of leftist President Evo Morales, Bolivia's first leader from an Indian majority centered in the western highlands, is conducting talks with governors of largely white provinces in the east who want autonomy.
Julian Torrico, a peasant leader, said he and other Morales supporters will storm the eastern city of Santa Cruz if the talks, which started Thursday, do not yield progress.
The government of Evo Morales took power by a majority and now these opposition governors don't want to let him govern," Torrico said.
Four of nine provinces in Bolivia have declared autonomy from the central government in referendums this year.
The differences flared into violence with opposition protesters occupying government buildings and energy installations.
Morales has said the opposition leaders are trying to overthrow the government.
Representatives of the Organization of American States and the 12-nation Union of South American Countries are among a group of international observers that has come to Bolivia for the negotiations.
Ivan Canelas, a government spokesman, said the talks provide a critical opportunity to break an impasse that has split the country for months.
He said the goal is to "give peace back to our country and give certainty to Bolivia."
