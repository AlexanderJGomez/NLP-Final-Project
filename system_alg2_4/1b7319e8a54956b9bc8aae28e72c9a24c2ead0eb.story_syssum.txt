(CNN) -- Separatist rebels who captured northern areas of Mali called a cease-fire starting Thursday, saying they had captured key territory and achieved their military mission.
Thursday, the regional group, Economic Community of West African States, met in the Ivorian capital, Abidjan, to discuss military intervention in Mali.
Amnesty International said northern Mali was teetering on the brink of disaster.
"All the food and medicine stored by major aid agencies has been looted, and most of the aid workers have fled," said Gaetan Mootoo, Amnesty International's researcher on West Africa.
"In a few days, years of medical efforts and success have disappeared in the flames."
In Kidal, Ansar Dine, an Islamist faction of the secular MNLA, has asked women to wear veils and destroyed a nightclub, Amnesty said.
Amnesty said it was concerned the group would mete out punishments in accordance with Sharia.
Meanwhile in the capital, Bamako, military leaders who overthrew President Amadou Toumani Toure because of his alleged inability to handle the Tuareg rebellion postponed plans Thursday for a national convention aimed at addressing political woes.
The African Union and ECOWAS have also slapped the military junta with travel and economic restrictions and have frozen its assets.
Sanctions targeted the supporters and relatives of the military junta and all those involved in contributing to the "destabilization" of Mali, the African Union said.
