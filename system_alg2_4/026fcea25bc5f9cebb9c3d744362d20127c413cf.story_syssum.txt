Peggy Shannon, 67, who works at the Senior Citizens Service Desk in San Diego City Hall, allegedly faced "continuous inappropriate sexual advances by the mayor while trying to do her job," according to the office of her attorney, Gloria Allred.
"I can forgive anybody but he needs to step down," she said.
As the list grows, city officials said Thursday that Filner might be booted from office later this month over a different, but related issue: money.
He has rebuffed calls to resign from all nine City Council members and from fellow Democrats, including California's two U.S. senators.
The San Diego's City Attorney's Office told CNN Thursday that it had found the charges were inappropriate.
The city attorney's office said a rarely used section of the city charter, Section 108, dating back to 1931, would allow for Filner to be removed from office -- without a recall -- over unauthorized payments from the city treasury.
The mayor's city credit card was stopped in July, Faulconer's office said.
"Based on this new evidence, I am broadening the scope of my Audit Committee hearing to investigate how Mayor Filner was able to circumvent credit card rules and how to prevent negative effects on the City's credit rating as a result of one person's misuse of taxpayer dollars."
