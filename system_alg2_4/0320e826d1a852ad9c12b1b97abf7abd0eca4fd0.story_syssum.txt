He didn't seem to utter any words, the source said.
The FBI was inside the trauma room during the stabilization and several other law enforcement agencies were outside the room, including the FBI, Boston police and Beth Israel police, according to the source.
There were no other patients in that secure unit for the duration of the time that he was there and Tsarnaev recovered very quickly, the source said.
Tsarnaev is now able to speak and has been interacting with medical staff, spokesman John Colautti said.
