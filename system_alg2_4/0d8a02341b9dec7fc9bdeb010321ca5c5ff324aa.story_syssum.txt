Now Jay-Z charts his escape from the hard-knock life, describes the reunion that healed the wounds of his childhood -- and even reveals his personal creed.
Jay-Z spoke with Oprah Winfrey about his father, his anger and his old life.
Oprah Winfrey: When you were 5, your family moved to the Marcy projects -- and then your father left when you were 11.
Never wanting to let myself get close to someone like that again.
Oprah: Wow.
They just wake up one day and their dad is gone.
He was a guy who was pretty detached from his feelings.
I also felt protective of my mom.
But I felt I had to make the situation better.
Oprah: I've read that when you were 12, you shot your brother in the shoulder.
Jay-Z: Yes -- and my brother was dealing with a lot of demons.
He was doing a lot of drugs.
I was saying, "You know, Ma, I've really been trying to look inward, and maybe I'm just not meant to fall in love like other people do."
Oprah: Wow.
And I guess I still had too much resentment and anger.
He never showed up.
Oprah: The second time, your father showed up.
He was saying stuff like "Man, you knew where I was."
I'm like, "I was a kid!
Jay-Z: When I was 9, my dad's brother got stabbed, and my dad went looking for the guy who did it.
You can't do that."
And my dad was in so much pain that he started using drugs and became a different person.
He had a bad liver, and he knew that if he continued drinking, it would kill him.
Jay-Z: Pretty much.
Jay-Z: Be true to yourself -- and keep things simple.
Oprah: But don't you think we're responsible only for what we know?
Jay-Z: As a kid, I didn't know any better.
Do you still think back on that time in your life?
