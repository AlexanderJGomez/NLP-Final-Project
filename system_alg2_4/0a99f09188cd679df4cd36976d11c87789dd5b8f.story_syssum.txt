Russell is familiar with how women are portrayed in the media.
To celebrate Interrupt magazine's launch, she's inviting the public to an art lab called "You Are a Genius" on New York's Lower East Side through Monday.
Cameron Russell: I had been thinking about an online participatory magazine for a while.
Critical voices from women and people of color are missing from many important conversations.
We knew it's crazy to start another media platform, but we came across many authentic voices online and offline that we felt we can bring together and showcase.
But it's not just girls.
These girls liked their bodies because they functioned well!
It's refreshing.
The lesson here is that when we value a narrow range of experiences and perspectives, we don't just have a media that lack diversity, we actually underestimate our audiences.
Russell: Actually, I think working on the offline Genius Lab.
We wanted to build a space where people felt comfortable and genius in their identity.
Check them out on our Tumblr feed.
Russell: The first several hundred submissions came from people who found out about the project online, mostly through Twitter.
We've found artists like Ernest English, who made a piece that is drawing the most attention in the Genius Lab.
When I was a kid, I was obsessed with politics.
Russell: I'm inspired by the people I work with.
And then there's the graffiti artist and muralist known as miss163.
