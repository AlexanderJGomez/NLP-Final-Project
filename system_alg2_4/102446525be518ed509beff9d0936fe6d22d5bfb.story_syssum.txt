(CNN) -- A police helicopter crashed into the roof of a pub crowded with Friday-night revelers in the Scottish city of Glasgow, trapping a number people under the debris, rescuers and witnesses said.
The helicopter, carrying two police officers and a civilian pilot, crashed on the roof of the pub at 10:25 p.m. local time, Scottish police said.
Grace Maclean and a friend were inside the pub listening to the band when the crash occurred.
"We were watching the band and there was kind of like a (roof) panel fell, there was a whoosh of dust, then we laughed that the band said, 'We didn't think we were going to bring the roof down,'" she said.
"Everyone was really confused and scared," she said.
There is no fire," she said.
"I thought that didn't sound right for a couple of seconds," O'Neill said.
On the Facebook page of the band Esperanza, a post indicates the band members all made it out of the club.
Think I just saw a helicopter crash in Glasgow," he tweeted.
Terrifying experience.
"My thoughts are with everyone affected by the helicopter crash in Glasgow -- and the emergency services working tonight," he said.
