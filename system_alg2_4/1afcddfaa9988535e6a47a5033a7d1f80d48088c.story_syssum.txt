I couldn't tell you this before," Robert Meyers told reporters after the arrest.
Robert Meyers said his wife tried to help Nowsch.
"My wife spent countless hours at that park consoling this boy," he said.
Police said they are looking for at least one more suspect, but they believe Nowsch was the shooter.
Police have said the shooting followed a road-rage incident that took place last week near a junior high school where Meyers gave her 15-year-old daughter a night-time driving lesson.
Robert Meyers told HLN's Nancy Grace on Thursday that the man threatened to kill his wife and daughter.
Steiber said Meyers then went looking for the road rage suspect, but, according to her husband, she just wanted to keep the situation away from the house.
Robert Meyers, who was out of town when his wife was shot, said the other car followed the Meyers and at some point away from the house there were gunshots.
"My son is a good boy.
"Are you all happy?
Police are looking for a second suspect, Tomaino, the homicide captain, said.
The captain said authorities were unaware until Thursday that the Meyers family knew Nowsch.
