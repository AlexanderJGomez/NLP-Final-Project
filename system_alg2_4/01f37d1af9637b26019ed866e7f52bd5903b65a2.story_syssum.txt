Washington (CNN) -- Macy Friday can't remember what she was thinking when -- mouth agape, eyes bugged -- she shook hands with Hillary Clinton in Denver this week.
What does she like about Hillary Clinton?
Here is our conversation:
I was just like, 'Wow.'
And then I realized it was me and I went up and I turned back at my family.
(long pause) I turned back at my family and I, like, I, you know, made the face.
And she is just a good role model for girls because, you know, she is just sort of, like, to everybody, 'Girls can be awesome, too.'
Macy: I didn't know, too, too, too much.
And her niece's name is Macy.
Did I already say Taylor Swift?
Macy: Maybe!
I don't know, like, if you wear glasses.
CNN: Thanks Macy...
(CNN did use the selfie that Finn took of his family and Clinton.
