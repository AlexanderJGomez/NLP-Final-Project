New Delhi (CNN) -- Here's the best way to understand the new India in 30 seconds.
The story struck me because it weaves together some important trends and forces in India as the nation undertakes the biggest elections in world history.
Even today, there are only 57 million broadband  subscribers in the country, according to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, or TRAI.
Many of these mobile users are buying cheap smartphones and data packages to access the Internet.
The second trend is the rise of rural India.
But there's no longer a great shame in being unable to speak the language of their colonial masters; instead, there's a new pride and confidence in India's many regional dialects and languages.
Many of these young, brash Indians have cast off the fatalism of their forefathers.
1 and No.
Some suggest that these trends mean India's elections will be fought and decided on social media.
India's Internet and Mobile Association says a strong social media campaign could swing up to 4% of votes.
One reason for this -- apart from limits to Internet access -- could be that Twitter and Facebook remain English language services, relatable to a small subset of Indians.
Why?
The three trends of mobile reach, the rural rise and the youth bulge are each combustible forces bubbling in a cauldron of uncertainty.
Watch India's elections very closely.
Calling these elections too early could be embarrassing, too.
