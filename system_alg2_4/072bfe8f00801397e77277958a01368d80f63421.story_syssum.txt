London (CNN) -- Phone hacking was widespread at the Daily Mirror newspaper when Piers Morgan was its editor, a former employee testified Wednesday, stopping just short of saying Morgan definitely knew about it.
Morgan refused to say who played the message for him or where, but admitted under sustained questioning that he believed it was a voice mail.
It doesn't necessarily follow that it was unethical," Morgan said.
In August, Mills told the BBC that a journalist working for a Mirror Group publication admitted hacking her voice mail.
She said she replied: "You've obviously hacked my phone and if you do anything with this story ...
Morgan "was the 'Dear Leader.'
He struck pre-emptively at Hipwell on Tuesday, pointing out that the journalist had gone to prison over a stock tip scandal and saying he would not be a reliable witness.
Much of the inquiry -- and a related police investigation -- focus on allegations of phone hacking by the News of the World.
The publisher of the paper, News International, announced Tuesday that a subsidiary had settled with seven people who accused Murdoch's newspapers of phone hacking.
Testimony by former staff of News of the World and News International last week focused on how much News International chief executive James Murdoch knew about hacking by his employees.
