The residents told Brazilian media they blame the police for the death, accusing authorities of mistaking the dancer for a criminal.
The injuries the dancer sustained appear to be consistent with a fall, Rio de Janeiro's State Security Secretariat said in a Twitter post, adding that his death is still being investigated.
According to Brazilian media, shots were heard during the standoff with police on Tuesday evening.
Shootouts are still relatively common in Rio's favelas, and clashes with police, even in slums that have already been "pacified," have increased in recent months.
The occupation will persist until the end of July, two months after the World Cup ends.
