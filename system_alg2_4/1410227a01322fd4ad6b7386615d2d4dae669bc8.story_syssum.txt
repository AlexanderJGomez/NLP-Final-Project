Fossett was last seen in early September, flying a single-engine plane on a pleasure flight from a Nevada ranch.
"As difficult as it is for me to reach this conclusion, I no longer hold out any hope that Steve has survived," wrote Peggy V. Fossett in court documents filed Monday with the Cook County [Illinois] Circuit Court.
"No one involved in the search holds out any hope that Fossett is still alive," the petition said.
"If Fossett was physically able to find water to survive on in the Nevada desert, he would have been physically capable of signaling searchers, by doing something as simple as crafting a large X of sticks or rocks, or by starting a signal fire," Rains said.
In the search for Fossett, wreckage from eight other crashes was discovered, one of them from the 1960s, the lawyers said.
