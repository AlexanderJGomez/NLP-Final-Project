Built in 1982, the New World shopping mall survived only 15 years before trouble came calling, according to the Bangkok Post.
The demolition, and a fire in 1999, left the mall roofless.
Toom said that most of these people were there only to feed the fish.
On Monday, a Bangkok Metropolitan Administration official declared the building condemned and ordered barricades erected to keep the public out, the Bangkok Post reported.
