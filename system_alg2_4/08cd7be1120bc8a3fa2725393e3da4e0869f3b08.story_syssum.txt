Washington (CNN) -- An Air Force officer who had been in charge of a military unit aimed at preventing sexual assaults made an initial court appearance Thursday on a sexual battery charge but did not enter a plea.
After taking the position with the sexual assault prevention unit in February, he underwent training aimed at preparing him for his duties, Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. John Dorrian said.
Arlington County declined an Air Force request that it allow Krusinski to be prosecuted under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
The arrest came two days before the Pentagon released a report showing a 6% increase in reported sexual assault cases within the military in the fiscal year that ended last September 30.
Anonymous survey results collected over a two-year period ending in 2012 indicate that the increase may have been higher than that.
