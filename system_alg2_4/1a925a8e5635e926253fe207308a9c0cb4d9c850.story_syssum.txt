(CNN) -- Billy Graham is being treated for pneumonia and "is responding well to antibiotic treatment," said a pulmonologist at the North Carolina hospital where the evangelist was admitted Wednesday.
Ross said Graham was visited Thursday by his pastor, the Rev.
Ross said that as Graham and his daughter were channel-surfing to find a news broadcast, they came upon a broadcast of Graham's 1973 crusade in St. Louis.
Five years later, Graham was holding crusades in tents in downtown Los Angeles.
"I was asked in an interview if this was our last crusade and I said it probably is -- in New York.
