It would be an even better thing if the discussion were based on fact rather than contaminated by inaccuracies and posturing.
For example, Fox News seems incapable of commenting on this story without the header "NSA Scandal," a lead that brings with it its own conclusion.
What's the NSA really about?"
Terrorists, drug traffickers, arms proliferators and the like live on a unitary global information grid where their communications co-exist with the communications of the very people the NSA is committed to protecting.
It was also clear that the agency would not have the power to do so -- legally, financially or technologically -- unless the American people were convinced that this power would be limited to its intended purpose, that even as constitutionally protected communications mingled with and were sorted from targeted communications, they would still be protected.
Resolution will hinge on how much trust people have in their government, or at least this part of it.
In most instances, since this is about foreign intelligence, authority comes from the president and is codified in Executive Order 12333.
Most intelligence collection -- by the NSA, CIA or any intelligence agency -- is not overseen by a court.
Most casual commentators simply assert that anytime the NSA is listening to an American, the agency must have a warrant.
..."
If it is tracking the communications of a legitimate foreign intelligence target and that target talks to an American, the NSA indeed covers it -- and always has.
This is what the NSA calls incidental collection of information to, from or about a U.S. person.
In one example, the Post referred to "large numbers of data base query incidents."
The NSA later confirmed that in one quarter there indeed were 115 incidents of NSA queries being incorrectly entered, mistakes such as mistyping or using overly broad search criteria.
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Hayden.
