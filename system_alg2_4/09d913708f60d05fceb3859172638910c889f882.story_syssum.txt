Brothers Pardeep Malik, 59, and Hamant Mullick, 60, are accused of running an enterprise whose products also turned up in Pennsylvania and Florida, according to the Nassau County District Attorney's Office.
Law enforcement authorities seized four tractor-trailers filled with knockoff health products from five locations on Long Island on Thursday.
The fake products included ChapStick, Johnson's Baby Oil, Vicks VapoRub, Vicks Inhaler, Vaseline and Always sanitary pads; the producers of the real products include major international brands such as Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble and Unilever, prosecutors said.
Nassau County Fire Marshall officials took samples of products they found and sent them to the manufacturers, who verified the counterfeits.
The prosecutor's office is trying to determine the chemical makeup of the products and the health risks, if any, associated with them.
Some sophisticated knockoffs may be hard to detect, but the price may be atypically low.
