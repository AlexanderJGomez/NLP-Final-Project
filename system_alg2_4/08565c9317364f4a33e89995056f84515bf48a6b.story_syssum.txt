Like a typical 7-year-old, her favorite part about school is the games.
"I like hide and seek."
Zara lives in Peshawar, capital of Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province, tucked right up against the Khyber Pass next to Afghanistan.
People's lives were shattered as the city found itself at the very core of Pakistan's war on terror.
The school administration wants as few adults loitering around as possible, afraid of suicide bombers.
But there is little the school can do to keep the children safe from the demons that haunt them.
"The exterior smile is a deception; it's the only coping mechanism the child has," Dr. Rizwan Taj, a psychiatrist in Islamabad, says.
The confusion for the adults as to why this is happening, why is this happening repeatedly, it trickles down to the children," Rizwan says.
"I like to do painting and I like to ..." she pauses and looks away.
She says it's what her parents are telling her, explaining that the Afghan refugees who have lived in the city for decades aren't responsible.
So for the time being, Zara and her friends are left to their own devices, trying to survive in a world their elders can't even make sense of -- carrying with them the knowledge that each day could be their last.
