The former French first lady Valerie Trierweiler -- whom Obama said in November he was looking forward to hosting -- isn't coming to the White House now that Hollande has announced their split.
"The protocol that dictates how state visits are handled is something that's steeped in hundreds of years of history," said Anita McBride, a former chief of staff to Laura Bush who helped plan state dinners.
It's not the first time a French president has come to Washington alone.
But questions such as who will sit next to Obama are still up in the air.
It's not necessarily a hard task, said McBride, because plenty of people would jump at the chance to sit next to Obama.
Instead a sturdy white tent on the South Lawn holds the hundreds of invited guests, who usually include some top donors and key allies in Congress.
On Monday the White House released the names and vintages of the wines poured at each course â€” a change from the last few state dinners, which listed only "American" bottles lest the price tag shock taxpayers.
And while the details still matter for staunch allies like France, a slip-up on protocol isn't likely to throw the United States' now-solid relationship with the country into jeopardy.
"Let's just say that we've come a long way from Freedom Fries," was how one senior administration official described the relationship Monday.
The same can be said for what Hollande calls "tax evasion" by U.S.-based tech firms (after Washington, the French President heads to Silicon Valley).
