Jason Segel and Paul Rudd star in "I Love You, Man," which opens Friday.
But don't call the film a "bromance" in the presence of Rudd and Segel.
Segel has also been in Apatow projects -- including last year's "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" -- and he stars in the TV series "How I Met Your Mother," which finds plenty of humor in male bonding.
"He just holds [the moment] a little too long."
In "I Love You, Man," Segel's character is rougher and looser than his characters in "Sarah Marshall" and "How I Met Your Mother."
In real life, claims Segel, he even has a man cave.

"I think we both had something to learn from each other," he said.
"Yeah, and my character had to learn that maybe it's time to grow up a little bit," Segel added.
"I think that we've all been kind of drawn to real stories, you know, characters that hopefully people can relate to and what's funny about just certain insecurites and just certain things in life.
"Just less fart jokes."
