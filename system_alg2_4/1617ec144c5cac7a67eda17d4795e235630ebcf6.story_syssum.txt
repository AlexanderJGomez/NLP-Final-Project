But as bidders make their pitches for his team, Donald Sterling -- Shelly's estranged husband and the team's other owner -- accused the NBA of violating his constitutional rights in trying to end his ownership of the franchise based on what he says was an illegally recorded conversation during a lovers' quarrel, according to a document provided by Donald Sterling's attorney.
A source close to the situation said roughly two weeks ago that Donald Sterling -- who repeatedly denied he's a racist in a CNN interview -- wouldn't pay the fine, would reject the ban and might sue the NBA.
His remarks were made in the heat of an argument, and while they were not justified, they were not meant to harm the NBA, the response says.
The document also says Sterling was active in the African-American community and that there was only one court case -- which he won -- of discrimination brought against him as owner of the Clippers in more than 30 years.
By filing the document, Donald Sterling is protecting his legal options but, at the same time, he realizes selling the team is the most likely outcome.
CNN's source on the potential sale said it was a busy Memorial Day weekend for Shelly Sterling.
Johnson called the whole situation sad in his own interview with CNN, in which he urged Sterling to sell the team.
The same source said Shelly Sterling will accept offers this week for the Clippers.
Shelly Sterling's attorney, Pierce O'Donnell, said no formal offers have been made for the team, which has risen in recent years from a last-place laughingstock to a playoff team with two superstars in forward Blake Griffin and guard Chris Paul.
But if it sold -- likely for between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, according to the well-placed source -- the NBA doesn't want either Sterling to have any ownership stake.
