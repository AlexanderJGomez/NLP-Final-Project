Can you tell me what Joe Cotton did?
I can.
Each of them won the Kentucky Derby horse race.
Bet you don't know Burgoo King.
In 1932, when a lot of people were depressed with a capital D, a lot of them were impressed by Burgoo King when he won the Kentucky Derby by three lengths and then the Preakness by a head.
Burgoo King was a no-go no-show.
Would you like to know why?
Bet you don't know Tim Tam, either.
In 1958, when folks were giving thought to buying one of Ford's really cool new cars, the Edsel, a lot of them were impressed by Tim Tam when he took the Kentucky Derby with a tremendous stretch run, then ran first in the Preakness, as well.
Bet you don't know Canonero II.
That was him.
And why were we all there?
To see Smarty Jones.
He could run in the rain, as he demonstrated at Churchill Downs while taking the Derby by nearly three lengths.
He could run Secretariat-style and leave everyone else gagging on his dust, as he showed at the Preakness while winning by more than 11 lengths.
"Nobody else," I said.
He was 36-to-1.
We observed a minute of silence for President Reagan, who passed away that same day.
Smarty Jones ran second that day.
I would see no Triple Crown won that day.
Horse racing.
But you know what?
