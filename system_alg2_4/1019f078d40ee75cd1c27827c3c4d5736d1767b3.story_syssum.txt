In America, it's the "independent spirit."
Until now.
What makes this court ruling even more preposterous is that these films are not recent films.
As a child, I remember watching Adel Iman films when I visited my family in Egypt during summer break.
As an Egyptian-American comedian, I had the opportunity to be part of the rise of stand-up comedy in the region.
As a performer, I was able to address, for the first time in my shows, sexual harassment and the religious hypocrisy of "complete religious freedom as long as you're Muslim or Christian."
Until now.
That a country, which was the "beacon of hope" less than one year ago, is now a catalyst for a "return to the dark ages."
This doesn't just prevent comedians, writers and artists from finding humor in the single biggest aspect of every Egyptian's life but it also will suppress creativity in general.
Regardless of the outcome in the Adel Imam trial, if Egyptians don't raise their voices against this ridiculous verdict, this may not just signal the demise of comedy in Egypt -- this could very well be the demise of the country itself.
