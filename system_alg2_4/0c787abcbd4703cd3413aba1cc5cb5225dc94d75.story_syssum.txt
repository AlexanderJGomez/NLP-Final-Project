MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- Mexico's tourism director on Wednesday downplayed the risk of violence facing tourists, despite warnings for travelers to think twice about visiting the country.
In recent days, the United States, Canada, France, Italy and Germany have issued alerts about travel to Mexico, where drug violence was blamed for more than 5,400 killings last year.
"Much more significant is the reduction [in travel to Mexico] because of the financial crisis."
"I think that, if there is a big problem in Mexico, they [students] should go somewhere else, because you never know what is going to happen," said Nereida Solis, a student.
"I think it would be a good idea to consider security things," added Karen Velasquez, another student.
I can't comment much, but if people want to go, people are going to go."
