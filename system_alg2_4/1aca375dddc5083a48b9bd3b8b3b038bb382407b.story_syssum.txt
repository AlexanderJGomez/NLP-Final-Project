What remains, however, rather difficult to predict is: what will an el-Sisi presidency bring to Egypt?
The last presidential elections resulted in a large number of candidates emerging, splitting the vote and leading to a run off between Ahmed Shafiq and Mohamed Morsy.
Morsy's former defense minister, el-Sisi, who removed him from office after substantial protests almost a year ago, and the Nasserist contender, Hamdeen Sabahi, who came in third in the last presidential elections.
Nor has el-Sisi himself been openly campaigning in rallies and so forth, with his team citing security concerns.
What seems to be clear, however, is that el-Sisi's most oft-repeated themes can be summed up in two: the Egyptian version of the "War on Terror," and an emphasis on the likelihood that Egyptians will not "rest" as the economic difficulties are addressed.
It is, however, unlikely such sentences will be carried out, regardless of an el-Sisi presidency, even though he announced in an interview that in his presidency there would be "no" Brotherhood.
The second theme relates more to the Egyptian economy, which is in a deeply worrying situation.
Be that as it may, however, el-Sisi will become president at a time when the Egyptian public is more tired than ever.
