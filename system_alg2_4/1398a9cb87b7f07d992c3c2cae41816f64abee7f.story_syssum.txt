(CNN) -- "Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens" director J.J. Abrams has come up with a nostalgic way to reveal the names of the movie's characters.
Now, thanks to some clever retro-style trading cards, we know the names of their characters.
According to the cards, Isaac, the X-wing pilot seen in the first trailer, is playing someone named Poe Dameron.
And Daisy Ridley, the actress we see speeding through a desert landscape in the trailer, is playing a character named Rey.
In addition to those three, Abrams also revealed the name of the cloaked figure wielding that heavily debated new lightsaber: That character is Kylo Ren.
