Washington (CNN) -- Dennis Apel has been a longtime critic of U.S. military policy and for 17 years has protested around Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.
At issue is whether someone previously barred from a military base may be convicted under federal law for "peacefully protesting" on a public road easement along the enclosed high-security facility.
The appeal presents a fact-specific inquiry into such issues as "concurrent" government jurisdiction, public forums and the limits of "exclusive control" asserted by the military.
The federal government owns and operates the base, but the state and county have held a "use easement" for more than a half-century, and they maintain the roads.
The Apels and their supporters from Pacific Life Community, a group that opposes nuclear weapons, had conducted monthly peace vigils in a special open "protest zone" created along the Pacific Coast Highway bisecting the base.
A federal appeals court eventually ruled in his favor, saying the special protest zone was not an area under the military's "exclusive right of possession."
"When an easement goes towards a public road, that easement includes the right to use the public road for speech activities," he said.
Chemerinsky: "The United States wants it both ways.
It's their base.
...
And Roberts said that even though there has been a protest zone in place since 1989, Apel can still be banned at the commander's sole discretion.
What's wrong with that?"
The case is U.S. v. Apel (12-1038).
