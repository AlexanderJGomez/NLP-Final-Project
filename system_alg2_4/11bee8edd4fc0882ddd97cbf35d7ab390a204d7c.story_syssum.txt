(CNN) -- Dr. Mehmet Oz is being sued for injures sustained by a New Jersey man.
Because, the plaintiff claims, he was injured when he tried Dr. Oz' home sleep remedy known as the "Knapsack Heated Rice Footsie."
And then there was the lawsuit filed last year against the Dallas Cowboys by a woman claiming she sustained burns on her legs.
More?
And that brings us to Dr. Oz.
The reasoning being that the heated socks will cause blood to be diverted to your feet, which in turn will cool the rest of your body.
How?
Blame the lawyers.
So, understandably, people flock to these lawyers with complaints about every imaginable wrong seeking a payday.
But it's easy for even a non-corporate lawyer to see that these ridiculous lawsuits give the reputable plaintiffs' attorneys -- and, frankly, all lawyers -- a black eye.
I can understand the lure of taking a questionable case that will reap you some media coverage and money.
And this will make it even more challenging for lawyers to earn a living.
But even if the plaintiff does ultimately win, it still will have sent a clear message to plaintiffs' attorneys who take these legally questionable cases: If you want money, you are going to have to really earn it.
