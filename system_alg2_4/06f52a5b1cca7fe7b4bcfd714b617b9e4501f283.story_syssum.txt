Melissa Goduti of Wallingford, Connecticut, boarded the ship about three hours before it ran aground Friday night, killing at least 11 passengers.
There were no announcements for a long time, and Goduti and her mother didn't see signs directing them toward lifeboats.
Nancy Lofaro of New Rochelle, New York, said the crew tried to do what they could, "but when we asked them, they said they had no information.
Costa staff in Lofaro's lifeboat were debating who would drive the boat, and they didn't seem to know what to do, she said.
Fleser said the lifeboat ride to the Tuscan island of Giglio was the last she saw of Costa Cruises employees until she, her husband and daughter reached a hotel in Rome on Saturday.
"The people of the island were wonderful," Fleser said.
We saw Costa people ... walking around with a bullhorn, not using it," Lofaro said.
The family then boarded a bus to Rome, where they were dropped off at a hotel.
There were two Costa cruise representatives at the hotel, "but every time we asked them if they could do something for us, they said they had no authority," she said.
Before Fleser and her family could make the journey home, they needed new passports to replace those lost on the sinking ship.
A hotel shuttle took Fleser and other Americans to the embassy, she said.
They received a voicemail from Costa saying the family would be reimbursed for the cruise and articles lost on the ship, she said, but the message didn't offer details of how those amounts would be determined.
In addition to arranging lodging, transportation and counseling for passengers, Costa will address possessions lost on board and is in the process of refunding cruise fares and costs incurred while on board, the company said in a statement.
