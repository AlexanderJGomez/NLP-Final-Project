Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel approved Wednesday the construction of a settlement in East Jerusalem just before U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is to visit the country on a peace mission.
Wednesday's approval of a 69-unit settlement in East Jerusalem -- which Palestinians consider to be the capital of their future state one day -- harkens to an incident in 2010 when Israel announced another East Jerusalem settlement during a visit by Vice President Joe Biden.
"This is a provocation by Netanyahu's government when John Kerry is coming to re-start the negotiations," Margalit said.
This means that Israel has no serious intentions to restart the peace process," Margalit said.
Brachie Sprung, an advisor to the Jerusalem mayor, said construction permission was granted by local planning and building committee.
"New building in Jerusalem is necessary for the development of the city and gives the opportunity for youngsters and students to live and buy," Sprung added.
