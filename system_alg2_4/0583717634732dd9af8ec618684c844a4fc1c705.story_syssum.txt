(CNN) -- The Syrian government is freeing some activists while arresting hundreds of others in its back-and-forth bid to placate protesters and crush dissent, a human rights lawyer said.
This is disputed by activists and eyewitnesses who told CNN that government snipers fired shots at unarmed protesters and government forces beat demonstrators.
They also want the release of all political prisoners and an end to emergency law.
There is no judicial system in Syria and the security apparatus arrests people and send them to courts directly," she said.
Mohammad al-Abdallah told CNN his brother was released Sunday after more than five years in prison.
Their father remains a political prisoner, he added.
