Atlanta (CNN) -- Top officials from the Federal Aviation Administration and the air traffic controllers' union kicked off a cross-country tour of air traffic control facilities on Monday, two days after a seventh reported case this year of a controller falling asleep on the job.
"It absolutely has to stop.
"We will do better."
If the shift from eight to nine hours isn't enough, "then obviously we'll take that into consideration," LaHood said.
On Saturday, the FAA suspended an air traffic controller for sleeping on the job at the Miami Air Route Traffic Control Center.
There were 12 controllers and two managers on duty at the time.
All of the incidents occurred during controllers' midnight shifts.
In at least one incident, the FAA has said, the controller deliberately went to sleep, while some of the others appear to have been accidental.
