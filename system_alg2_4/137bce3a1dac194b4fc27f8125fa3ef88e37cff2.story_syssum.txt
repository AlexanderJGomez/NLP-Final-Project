Baghdad (CNN) -- Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is asking lawmakers to withdraw confidence from his deputy after Saleh al-Mutlaq made controversial comments this week over American forces withdrawing from Iraq, state media reported late Saturday.
The crisis pits al-Maliki, a Shiite, against Iraqiya, a powerful political bloc that enjoys support from Sunnis and more secular Iraqis.
The Iraqiya bloc, headed by former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, made its move Friday night.
They also say that the hundreds of people seized by the government in October for backing terrorism and supporting the banned Baath Party are Iraqiya supporters.
The largely secular Iraqiya movement won two more seats than al-Maliki's party, but a merger of the premier's Shiite Muslim slate with a smaller Shiite bloc put him first in line to form a government.
The political process is going in a very wrong direction, going toward a dictatorship," he said.
And this is going to be a disaster.
More than 4,000 Americans and an estimated 115,000 Iraqis died in the invasion and the years of insurgency and sectarian warfare that followed.
Mahmoud Othman, a Kurdish member of parliament, said lawmakers discussed the Iraqiya move on Saturday and said it reflects "a level of mistrust between the blocs, the government, Iraqiya and others.
He is worried that the problem could morph into fighting between Sunnis and Shiites or violence against the government.
"It's sectarian."
