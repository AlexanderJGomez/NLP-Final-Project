(CNN) -- The president of Ukraine's top football club has warned six of its players who have gone AWOL they will "suffer" if they don't return to the conflict-torn country.
Each of them has a minimum release clause, which is tens of millions of euros.
Shakhtar, which regularly features in Europe's top competition the Champions League, play rivals Dynamo Kiev in the Ukrainian Super Cup Tuesday, a curtain raiser to the Ukraine domestic league season.
It is unclear where the match will be played, although Akhmetov would like it to take place in Kharkiv, a city over 150 miles north of Donetsk.
Of the six AWOL players, playmaker Douglas Costa is arguably the most valuable.
