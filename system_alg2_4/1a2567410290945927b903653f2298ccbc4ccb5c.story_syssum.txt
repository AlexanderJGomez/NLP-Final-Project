Madonna, that is.
And then I look at this week's Billboard chart and I see I thought wrong.
For those of you keeping score, that's more than Elvis, more than The Beatles.
She's an '80s child whose 2005 single "Hung Up" holds the Guinness Book record for topping the charts in 41 countries, while 2012's MDNA was No.
The two pop icons released debut albums within two years of each other, Madonna in 1983 and Houston in 1985.
And yet Houston's gone, Michael Jackson's gone, Prince is semi-retired and everyone else, with the exception of U2, is making their money off nostalgia.
While MDNA is about three songs too long for my taste, I will tell you the first five songs make it very difficult not to want to dance, and that the track "Gang Bang" is pure genius.
You can tell you're watching a Woody Allen film with the first five minutes of dialogue.
"Seriously... like your Madonna?"
But then again, it wouldn't be Madonna if a song like that was.
