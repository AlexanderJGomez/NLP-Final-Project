The latest episode still unfolding in Southern California implicates, oddly enough, a former Los Angeles police officer, 33-year-old Christopher Jordan Dorner, who allegedly is seeking redress for perceived mistreatment by the LAPD.
By looking closely enough, one can usually make some sense of seemingly senseless behavior.
Mass murderers tend to be middle-aged men who see themselves as victims of injustice.
Believing that his firing is patently unjust, and with nothing left to lose, he decides sooner or later to become the powerful one who will do the "firing."
These five victims are actually surrogates, in what is known as "murder by proxy."
Particularly frightening in the ongoing L.A. drama, of course, is the marksmanship skills that Dorner undoubtedly acquired through his careers with the Navy and in law enforcement, giving added significance to the phrase, "armed and dangerous."
Others have been made to suffer, as he has in the past.
