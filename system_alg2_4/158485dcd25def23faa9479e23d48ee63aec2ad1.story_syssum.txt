(CNN) -- Financial transactions have always been at the heart of our society, but growing smartphone and Internet penetration are inspiring new, disruptive approaches.
This has impacted commercial structures across the world and leaders now look to new economic models, motivated not only by P for profit, but also P for People, Planet and Purpose; welcome to a reality where a 4P bottom line will become the norm.
The Bitcoin is an example of digital technology in action -- a global, decentralized currency without physical borders, national sovereignty or middlemen -- and similar P2P (person to person) models will undoubtedly increase in the future.
Inspiration on where the future is unfolding is to be found in Africa -- where a substantial unbanked population and a growing mobile youth present enormous potential for financial services innovation and financial inclusion.
Beyond digital platforms for the transfer of money, goods and services, smartphones are an enabler of education, information, work, health, social participation and more sustainable solutions.
We are also witnessing "betapreneurship" -- in which products or services are tested and developed through interaction with customers -- emerging across the business spectrum, and this is in line with 4P thinking and enhanced by mobile platforms.
The networked society offers transparency and, when everyone and everything that can benefit is connected to the Internet, business must evolve to match a new global mindset.
