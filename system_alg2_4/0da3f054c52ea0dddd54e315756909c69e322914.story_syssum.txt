(LifeWire) -- When George Dello of San Diego was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and told he had at best five months to live, he didn't immediately begin the chemotherapy treatments his doctor recommended.
"They still have another 150 feet to grow and are going to stick around for another 1,000 years.
The idea that dying well is as important as living well gained cultural currency last year when Randy Pausch, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon University, delivered a final lecture a month after learning that his pancreatic cancer had spread and was inoperable.
Health permitting, a trip like the one Dello took with his wife can help, as can visits from friends and family.
As his illness progressed, Wallace, a former adjunct professor of public policy at George Mason University, put his teaching and writing skills to work by starting a blog, "Navigating Through ALS," and using it as a platform to help others suffering from the disease.
Susan Wallace, a part-time editor, says her husband's illness, while painful and difficult, offered an opportunity of sorts.
Often, she says, people worry so much about what to say to someone with a terminal illness -- or about saying the wrong thing -- that they just stay away.
"'God has a reason' or 'tomorrow will be another day' -- those kinds of things are trite, but they're also impersonal," says Brandt.
"If the person wants to chat and talk, then just ask a question or two and let the person talk.
Susan Wallace says her husband had time to repair one particularly nagging rift before he died, and Dello also took opportunities to resolve disputes with friends and former co-workers.
They may not say those words, but that's what those visits can be with friends and loved ones."
