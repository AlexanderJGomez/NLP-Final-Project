London (CNN) -- Jacintha Saldanha should never have become a household name.
She spent her time off duty in the family home in the southwestern city of Bristol, according to UK media reports.
But for her classmates and colleagues back home in India, she was a deeply religious, benevolent and bold young woman.
Sister Aileen Mathias, chief nursing officer at the Father Muller Medical College in the southern Indian city of Mangalore.
Both of us will pray together for the patients," Mathias said.
"Jacintha was a generous person.
"She was a forward-looking girl.
And she was an active participant in several activities of the college," Mathias said.
She was not that type who would do that," she said.
"She was very good, polite, but a very bold girl.
...
A family acquaintance, Ivan D'Souza, also considered her a "confident" person.
Others back in Britain also praised her as a professional and caring person.
For now, D'Souza said, much of Saldanha's family is in her birthplace, waiting for her body to arrive.
(Heart) Jacintha saldanha."
