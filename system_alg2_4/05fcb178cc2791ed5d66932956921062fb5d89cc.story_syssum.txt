(CNN) -- Florida A&M University band director Julian White, who had been under pressure to step aside after the hazing-related death of a band member, is retiring, his attorney announced Thursday.

White, who had been with FAMU for 40 years, had tried to root out hazing for the past 22 years, his attorney Chuck Hobbs said.
