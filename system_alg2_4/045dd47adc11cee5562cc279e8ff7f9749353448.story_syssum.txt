(CNN) -- In the morning hours of April 21, 2010, Arleen Weise got a phone call from her son's friend, telling her that an explosion had ripped through the Gulf of Mexico oil rig where her 24-year-old had been working.
"I knew all along that BP was the devil in that accident," Weise said.
The firm agreed to shell out $4.5 billion in government penalties and plead guilty to a dozen felony charges after the April 20, 2010 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon rig led to the largest oil spill in U.S. history.
It doesn't nearly amount to what we've lost," said Weise.
"All of us at BP deeply regret the tragic loss of life caused by the Deepwater Horizon accident as well as the impact of the spill on the Gulf coast region," said the statement from Bob Dudley.
"I think people have now come back to eating Louisiana seafood.
"I'm just not really sure what's going to happen now," he said.
BP posted a $17.2 billion loss in the quarter when the explosion took place, but has been profitable since, tallying total profits of $43 billion over the course of the subsequent nine quarters.
