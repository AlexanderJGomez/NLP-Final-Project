Pilot Roger Peterson also died in the crash.
A few months later, the Civil Aeronautics Board blamed the accident primarily on the pilot's lack of qualification and certification to fly solely by instruments and secondarily on an inadequate weather briefing.
The NTSB never fully closes a case, but any petition to re-examine a crash needs to show that there is new information suggesting the original probable cause is incorrect, NTSB spokesman Eric Weiss said.
In 1959, Holly, Valens and Richardson were part of the Winter Dance Party, a tour that had started in Milwaukee and traveled to small cities in Minnesota and Iowa.
Country legend Waylon Jennings, then Holly's bass player, gave up his seat to a sick Richardson.
Gary Busey played Holly in the 1978 movie "The Buddy Holly Story."
