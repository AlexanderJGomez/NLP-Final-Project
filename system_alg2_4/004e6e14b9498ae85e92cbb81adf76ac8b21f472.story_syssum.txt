"We're not just robots they send out there," umpire Tim McClelland (2nd from L) told author Bruce Weber.
Umpires?
"Within baseball circles there is a common baseball axiom, 'If pitchers weren't so stupid, hitters would never get a hit,' " he said in an e-mail.
Umpires, on the other hand, rarely get written about at all -- in fact, they're often treated as less than human.
") Weber found a fraternity (and they are almost all men) much like cops or soldiers: tight-lipped believers in baseball law and order.
Umpires need that presence because they're often baseball's most disrespected men.
And yet Major League Baseball doesn't participate in umpire training or development, entrusting it to two umpire-run private schools, Weber observes.
"It would be like training for the marathon and never running more than 5 miles," he says.
He talks about panic overtaking a pitcher, as it did for Darling in a 1984 game in which he got pasted by the Cubs; he also addresses the rush of pitching in a World Series game and -- in a treat for baseball fans -- goes over the extra innings in perhaps the most famous college baseball game ever, a 1981 extra-inning contest that Darling's Yale Bulldogs lost to Frank Viola's St. John's Redmen, 1-0.
Pitchers get more support than umpires, of course.
Though time has dulled the pain, "I think he lives with [that call] every day," Weber said.
When watching games now, the Yankees fan says, he'll focus on the umpires.
"Umpires are people, too," veteran ump Tim McClelland told Weber.
... Somebody says, 'Kill the umpire,' and people go, 'Heh, heh, that's funny,' but in order to do that, you have to disassociate the umpire from the person.
