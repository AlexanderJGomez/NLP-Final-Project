(CNN) -- The most difficult decision a member of Congress will ever have to make is to commit our nation's armed forces to military action against an enemy.
A careful examination of the current situation and an understanding of our history in the region advise that the United States must proceed with caution before entering another Middle Eastern conflict.
Rather, a strike on Syria must consider the greater strategic implications of military action and should be about one thing: the best strategic interests of the United States.
Next, the administration has yet to clearly articulate the goals, objectives and potential costs of a military action in Syria.
I don't believe that our military, or the American people, are ready to sink the ship.
A similar argument was used against Saddam Hussein, leading to the Gulf and Iraq Wars; a similar argument was used against the Taliban and al Qaeda forces in Afghanistan; a similar argument was used yet again against Moammar Gadhafi in Libya.
I believe it would be unwise to take on a situation that very likely could produce this same result.
Such a situation would likely warrant a U.S. military strike.
