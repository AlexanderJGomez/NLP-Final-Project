(CNN) -- A property dispute between family members apparently led to a shooting in which a man killed two people in the central Virginia town of Louisa before he was shot by police, authorities said.
The incident began when deputies responded to a report of an argument at the home, police said.
Two people were killed and four were wounded, said Sgt.
No deputies were wounded.
The four wounded people were taken to the University of Virginia Hospital in Charlottesville, Molnar said.
