The leader of these Chinese hackers says there "is always a weakness" on networks that allows cyber break-ins.
There are Web sites with high-level security, but there is always a weakness," says Xiao Chen, the leader of this group.
The three belong to what some Western experts say is a civilian cyber militia in China, launching attacks on government and private Web sites around the world.
"First, you must know about the Web site you want to attack.
CNN decided to withhold the address of these hackers' Web site, but Xiao Chen says it has been operating for more than three years, with 10,000 registered users.
On camera, Xiao Chen denies knowing anyone who has targetted U.S. government Web sites.
CNN has no way to confirm if his claim is true.
This week, the Pentagon said computer networks in the United States, Germany, Britain and France were hit last year by what they call "multiple intrusions," many of them originating from China.
U.S. officials have been cautious not to directly accuse the Chinese military or its government of hacking into its network.
But again off-camera, Xiao Chen says after the alleged Pentagon attack, his colleagues were paid by the Chinese government.
But if Xiao Chen is telling the truth, it appears his colleagues launched a freelance attack -- not initiated by Beijing, but paid for after the fact.
One of the biggest problems experts say is trying to prove where a cyber attack originates from, and that they say allows hackers like Xiao Chen to operate in a virtual world of deniability.
