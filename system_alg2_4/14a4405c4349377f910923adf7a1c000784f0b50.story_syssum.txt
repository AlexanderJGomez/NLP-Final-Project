A suspected U.S. drone strike killed 20 people in North Waziristan, a region along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, a Pakistani intelligence official told CNN Friday.
A military officer who requested anonimity for the same reason, told CNN that two drones were in the area, but only one of them fired.
After the apology, Pakistani leaders reopened the routes through Pakistan's western border.
Pakistani government officials have been angered by suspected U.S. drone airstrikes in the country that have left many dead.
