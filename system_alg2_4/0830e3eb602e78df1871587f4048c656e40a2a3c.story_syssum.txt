When buying beef, we tend to stick to what we know, which may be why almost 60 percent of our beef dollars go for ground beef.
A 3½-ounce serving provides 27g to 30g of protein and is an excellent source of iron, zinc, and phosphorus.
More than 90 percent of the beef we buy originates in America, while most of the rest is Canadian bred.
• Grain-finished: Nearly 75 percent of U.S. beef comes from cattle fattened on grain (usually corn) for three to six months in feedlots.
• Grass-finished: Grass- or pasture-finished beef comes from cattle that forage on grasses and legumes.
Their meat is lower in saturated fat, cholesterol, and calories than grain-finished.
Most is imported from Canada, followed by Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and Brazil.
About 90 percent of American beef is sold as large vacuum-packed cuts.
Packers then began selling vacuum-packed beef, the same large cuts sold at warehouse club stores.
• Fat content: The USDA defines "lean beef" as having less than 10 grams (g) of total fat, 4.5g or less of saturated fat, and less than 95 milligrams of cholesterol per 3½-ounce serving (100g) of cooked beef.
Because lean beef contains less fat, it's best cooked to medium-rare (145°F) or medium (160°F) to optimize tenderness.
In general, the redder the meat, the more iron it contains (beef liver has the most).

• Natural and Organic: Beef labeled "natural" must not contain any artificial ingredients and cannot be more than minimally processed, such as ground beef.
• Buy lean cuts.
And when the fat cooks away, lean cuts provide more meat for your dollar.
Divide into portions, and freeze the surplus.
Advice to buy a side or quarter of beef may seem sensible, but you'll likely have more meat than you can store.
