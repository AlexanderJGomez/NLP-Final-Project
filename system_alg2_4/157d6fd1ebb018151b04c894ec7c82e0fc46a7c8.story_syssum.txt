Densely populated barrios (neighborhoods) occupy the hills encompassing the bustling city center, rising a further 1,400 feet towards the satellite town of El Alto.
The La Paz urban gondola will consist of three separate service lines stretching across a combined 10.7 kilometer (6.1 mile) area of the city.
With individual pods traveling at a speed of 18 kilometers per hour (11 mph), the gondola aims to offer a transit system many times faster than more traditional modes of city transportation.
Cost benefits like these have been key in convincing South American cities like La Paz that urban gondolas are a viable and economical transport solution.
Marketing executive at Doppelmayr, Ekkehard Assmann, meanwhile speaks of private compliments the company received from Venezuelan officials regarding the Caracas "Teleferico" project and how it has "increased economic opportunity" as well as "lowered crime rates" in many poorer and previously disconnected areas where stations are located.
"Being able to connect people from an island, which is what these barrios often are, to the wider city where they can access economic, social and cultural opportunities, that's the real value," Dale said.
Many skeptics point to the "cable car" system built in East London to connect the O2 Arena and the ExCel Exhibition Centre across the River Thames during the 2012 Olympic Games as an example of an urban gondola project gone wrong.
"It's a nice bit of tourist infrastructure but it's not a serious mass transit solution in this part of London," Biggs said.
Although critical of the London project, Biggs believes the gondola concept itself can still offer a valuable urban transit option if constructed in locations where there is demand and the economic case can be justified.
