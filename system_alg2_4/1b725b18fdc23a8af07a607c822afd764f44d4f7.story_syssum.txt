(CNN) -- Massachusetts child welfare authorities have found no evidence of neglect or abuse connected with a 10-year-old Brockton rapper who does adult-themed music videos.
According to Isaksen, anyone can file a 51 A report, which is an allegation of child abuse and/or neglect; in fact, she told CNN the agency encourages the public to do so.
Krowski said he believes a racially motivated double standard was applied to his client, who he said turned 10 in February, and his family, which is of Puerto Rican descent.
According to Krowski, the investigation was based on small "snippets" of Rivera's music.
Krowski said his client has received an outpouring of offers to do shows and go on tour.
