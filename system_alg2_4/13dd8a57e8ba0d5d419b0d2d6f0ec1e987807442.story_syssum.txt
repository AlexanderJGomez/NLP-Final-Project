Jackson Irungu is quitting Kenya after being targeted for being gay.
There is no way to corroborate such incidents with the police because homosexual Kenyans are just too afraid to report them.
"They have a weapon to which they defend themselves," says Pauline Kimani, a leader of an umbrella organization for gays in Kenya.
She says that gay Kenyans are arrested on charges like 'loitering' and "disturbing the peace."
A few people defend gay rights on the streets of Nairobi.
"This is an abomination that is totally unacceptable by God who formed us not to function in that way," says Patrick Kuchio, a popular preacher at Parklands Pentecostal Church.
"They say, 'look, you are evil, the law also disagrees with you,'" says Kimani, "You are not supposed to exist within our community."
But since forming an umbrella organization, their leaders say there is a slow thawing of attitudes towards gays in Kenya.
But for an openly gay man Kenyan like Irungu, progress is too slow in Kenya.
