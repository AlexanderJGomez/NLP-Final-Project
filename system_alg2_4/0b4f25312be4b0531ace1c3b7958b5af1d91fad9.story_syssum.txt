Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration sent mixed signals Wednesday on its stance on a no-fly zone in Libya, with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton saying U.N. backing was essential while White House spokesman Jay Carney left the door open to the United States acting unilaterally or in concert with NATO allies.

A few hours later, Carney told reporters at the White House that U.N. backing was just one possible form of the international support sought for any military intervention in Libya.
On Wednesday, Carney reiterated the White House stance that all options remain on the table regarding Libya, and he specified that a possible no-fly zone was being actively discussed by both the United States and NATO.
Obama, in response to questions about the U.S. response in Libya, told reporters last week that that it was important to ensure that the Libyan people feel "full ownership" for any transformation and cited Egypt's recent revolution as an example.
