Days after he was found dead, then-NFL star Aaron Hernandez was arrested and charged with murder.
He has pleaded not guilty.
Just two years ago, he was one of the NFL's most promising tight ends, inking a $40-million contract extension with the New England Patriots.
"I saw a closeness with them that I'd never seen before," Montgomery said of the relationship between Hernandez and his father.
Police reports linked Hernandez and several other University of Florida football players to an argument in the parking lot.
Hernandez was also suspended at least once for marijuana, an issue that would follow him as he entered the draft his junior year.

Lloyd didn't own a car.
Lloyd said Hernandez spent about $10,000 that night.
Lloyd was dating Shaneah Jenkins, the link between the young man who dreamed of the NFL and the all-American who made it.
Daryl Hodge was with Lloyd when he said Lloyd got a text from Hernandez, asking to hang out later that night.
Prosecutors say Lloyd was last seen with Hernandez and Hernandez's two associates, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, around 2:30 a.m. in a rented silver Nissan Altima.
Three people got out of the car, and Lloyd was not one of them.
They, too, pleaded not guilty.
Jurors also didn't hear anything about what happened in Boston on July 16, 2012 -- the night two men were murdered outside a club where Hernandez had been.
After leaving the second nightclub, Hernandez and the friend returned to their SUV and pulled over on a nearby street where Hernandez removed a revolver from the engine block, Haggan said.
Hernandez began trailing Abreu, Furtado and three of their friends in his SUV, authorities said.
Hernandez was charged in the double homicide in May, and he pleaded not guilty.
