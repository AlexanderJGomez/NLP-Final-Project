The defendants are on trial, accused of plotting to extort $25 million from Travolta after 16-year-old Jett Travolta died from a seizure in the Bahamas in January.
The employee learned through the family attorney, Travolta said, that it was "in regards to a paper I signed in the Bahamas."
Bridgewater gave her copies of the papers, which included ambulance dispatch reports and a paper signed by Travolta releasing the ambulance company from legal liability, Maynard-Gibson testified.
Bridgewater told Travolta's lawyer that her client believed the documents could suggest that Travolta was negligent by wanting to take his unresponsive son to his private jet for a flight to a Florida hospital, instead of going directly to a local hospital, she said.
The paramedic, however, asked Travolta to sign a statement releasing the ambulance company from liability.
At the hospital, Travolta was told his son "wasn't alive," he said.
An attorney representing Bridgewater and Lightbourne asked Travolta if the defendants ever contacted or threatened him directly.
One of the actor's attorneys, Michael McDermott, took the witness stand Wednesday afternoon and began testimony about a videotaped meeting between him and one of the defendants.
