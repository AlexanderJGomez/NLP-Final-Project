Steal-Your-Client."
So this time around, come Election Day 2012, a frustrated Bradshaw says he might not vote at all.

When asked what she'd say to Bradshaw, the Iowa Democratic chair's words got pointed.
"I'd point to the record of achievement, in the face of two things happening simultaneously: The near-collapse of the entire economy, an economy that was bleeding 750,000 jobs.
