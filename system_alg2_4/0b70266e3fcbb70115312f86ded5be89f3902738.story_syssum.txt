More than 50,000 people witnessed the burial of 775 newly identified genocide victims at the Centre Potocari -- the official Srebrenica Genocide Memorial where 5,000 genocide victims are buried -- a few miles outside the city, according to Bosnia-Herzegovina's official news agency, Fena.
Witnesses, human rights investigators and court testimonies documented the summary executions, as well the rape and murder of women.
"This includes Ratko Mladic, who presided over the killings and remains at large," he said, referring to the former Bosnian Serb army commander.
Fena news agency reported that Boris Tadic, president of Serbia, also attended the burial memorial of the genocide victims and promised to find Serb war criminals.
A lot of time has passed, and I have done everything possible for Mladic to be arrested," he said.
