(CNN) -- Sri Lankan officials rejected a proposed cease-fire from the Tamil Tiger rebels Sunday, warning instead that government troops intended to continue a new offensive until the group surrenders, a senior government official said.
Government troops made significant advances into rebel-held territory on Friday and Saturday, according to Sri Lankan Army sources.
"We welcome the attempts by the U.N. and its agencies to assist the civilian population and are ready to engage and cooperate with them to address the humanitarian needs of the population.
The Tigers have been fighting for an independent state in Sri Lanka's northeast since 1983.
