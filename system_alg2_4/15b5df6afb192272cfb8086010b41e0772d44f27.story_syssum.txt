Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott promptly announced the state will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.
Although the law provides for approved voter registration certificates with no photo as acceptable for voting in certain circumstances, the court said the law imposes "strict unforgiving burdens on the poor."
The panel of judges for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia also said it was ruling only on the Texas law, and not issuing a statement about other state voting laws.
The ruling comes as another three-judge panel in Washington is hearing arguments this week on a similar law passed in South Carolina.
"Chalk up another victory for fraud," said Gov.
I will continue to work with Attorney General Abbott to fight for the same right that other states already have to protect their elections."
Earlier this month, a state court in Pennsylvania approved a voter ID law requiring photo identification at the polls.
