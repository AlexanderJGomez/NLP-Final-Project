(CNN) -- In practical terms, it might seem that the recent arrests of key Taliban members and the success of the U.S. offensive in southern Afghanistan might indicate a new phase in the war against the Taliban.
In the world of Omar and the Taliban leaders, many are driven by the power of religious visions and dreams.
Each "true night dream" is nothing less than a prophecy of God.
I was told that it was Omar's own "true night dream" -- where a mountain was about to fall on him when Allah appeared in the shape of a man -- that led him first to wear the holy relic of the cloak of the Prophet Mohammed.
"The prophet's cloak can be opened only when touched by a true leader of the faithful," another Taliban official told me.
"And we know," the Taliban official told me, "that whoever sees Allah in a dream surely has seen Him, since Satan cannot impersonate Him in a true dream."
Ultimately, it may simply be that unless Omar has another dream that tells him to sever his alliance with bin Laden, the Taliban will remain al Qaeda's steadfast ally and never surrender or negotiate.
