"Our Palestinian brothers should declare an independent state," Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced to an assembly of Arab foreign ministers in Cairo.
Erdogan said the rebel council "reflects the will of the [Libyan] people."
In a move that is sure to win support on the streets of many Arab cities and towns, the Turkish leader continued his diplomatic offensive against Israel.
The assembled foreign ministers applauded when Erdogan said, "Israel should compensate the rights of the families of the victims.
But outside the Arab League headquarters on Tuesday, a less welcoming crowd greeted the Turkish leader.
"Erdogan he did not mention Syria," said Syrian film director Maan Alhasba.
The Turkish government has repeatedly criticized the brutal military crackdown on protesters in Syria, but Erdogan made no mention of Turkey's neighbor to the east during his speech in the Arab League.
