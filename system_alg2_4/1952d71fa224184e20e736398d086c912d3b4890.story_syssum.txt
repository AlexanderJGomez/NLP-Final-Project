In Tagalog "pagpag" means the dust you shake off your clothing or carpet, but in Fabon's poverty- stricken world, it means chicken pulled from the trash.
Fabon is the merchant and pays the trash dealer just over a dollar for tonight's supply of garbage and scraps.
It's very easy to sell because it's very cheap.
After bagging up the chicken scraps she heads home to Tondo, a neighborhood infamous in the Philippines as one of the poorest slums in Manila.
"Pagpag!"
For him, 20 pesos is full day's pay, says Sumanda.
But it's a survival mechanism for the poorest of the poor," she says.
Maria Theresa Sarmiento, PCF's manager of health and nutrition, says that when the school first opened she was treating children with a range of illness and disease.
Sarmiento says that parents know pagpag is not a good source of food for their children, but that they don't have any choice.
