The trade in four conflict minerals -- tin, tantalum, tungsten (the 3Ts), as well as gold -- fuels the war in eastern Congo today.
We regularly travel to eastern Congo, and on our last trip, we traced the minerals from the mines.
We've seen how armed groups on all sides of the conflict are reaping hundreds of millions of dollars per year by controlling mines and trading routes, selling minerals to international traders and smelters, which in turn sell them to electronics and jewelry companies.
Some minerals trading companies have also argued that Congress and the conflict minerals movement will force them to pull out of Congo, creating an embargo and hurting miners.
Companies now have an opportunity to achieve this goal and help Congolese communities through three key steps:
The reality is that the bill will accelerate this supply chain reform, and Intel and Motorola are already starting a forward-looking audit process to purchase tantalum from legitimate mines, including those in Congo.
Some companies may choose to temporarily stop buying minerals from Congo while they reform their supply chains.
And electronics and jewelry companies should support these processes with a fraction of the profits they've earned from these conflict minerals over the past dozen years.
