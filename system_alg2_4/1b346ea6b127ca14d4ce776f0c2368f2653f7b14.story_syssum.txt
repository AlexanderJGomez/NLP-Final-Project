(CNN) -- Before the interview for Talk Asia, all I knew about Julio Iglesias was that he sings love songs -- and that the ladies seem to love him.
Iglesias' renowned voice has made him a superstar worldwide but his first foray into the spotlight wasn't through his voice, it was his feet.
Iglesias humbly admits he was never a real football talent but he had the discipline which would see him play with the biggest names of that generation.
Perhaps it's that courage that saw him through one of the most challenging times of his life.
The crash compressed a nerve in his spine leaving him paralyzed from the chest down; a paralysis that would see him bed-ridden for two years.
I believe people come into your life for a reason."
For Iglesias, that belief was crystallized in that devastating moment, and those challenging two years changed his life.
He discovered a passion for music that he didn't know he had.
I started to think that I could be alive again ...
Discipline woke up my life again."
"Since that time I understood that music, and the passion for music, was my life ...
The life came back to my eyes and I became a singer."
