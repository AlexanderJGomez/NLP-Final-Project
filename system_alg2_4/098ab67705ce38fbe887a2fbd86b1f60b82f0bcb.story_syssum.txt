(CNN) -- Republicans now have the Senate Majority and control of Congress going into next year.
Republicans will have to thread the needle between opposing the President and pushing forward their own agenda.
For the first time in eight years, Republicans will have the chance to demonstrate that they are the party of common sense ideas, because they will run the entire show on Capitol Hill.
Now is the time for party leaders, rank-and-file members of Congress and governors to come forward and present the best ideas our party has to offer.
In addition, Republican lieutenants like House Majority Leader Kevi McCarthy, House Republican Whip Steve Scalise and Senate Republican Whip John Cornyn are all loyal and very able leaders to help implement the party's agenda.
That is why Republicans must not get caught up in the 2016 election year cycle before presidential politics takes over.
While we can continue to show why Obamacare remains a failure, we do not have 60 votes in the Senate to repeal it.
While the GOP won't ever have an amnesty style bill that the Democrats have proposed in the past, Republicans must offer a version of immigration reform in order to attract Hispanic voters and take the issue off the table.
It's time for Republicans to shine and prove that they can successfully navigate this new journey forward.
The election victory is theirs to build upon, or lose again very shortly.
