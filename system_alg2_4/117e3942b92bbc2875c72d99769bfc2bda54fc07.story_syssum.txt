"Today's resolution will ensure that the elimination of the Syrian chemical weapons program happens as soon as possible and with the utmost transparency and accountability," Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said.
The turnaround came this month, when Russia called for Syria to divest itself of its chemical weapons arsenal after U.S. President Barack Obama accused Syria of crossing a "red line" with the use of nerve gas and threatened a strike.
Both the United States and Russia warned that if Syria failed to adhere to the terms of the U.N. resolution, it would face consequences.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the council that his country, long an ally of the Syrian government, "will stand ready to take action" if the resolution needs enforcement.
Ambassador Bashar Jaafari said the resolution holds all parties in Syria accountable for the use of chemical weapons.
The Security Council vote followed action by the executive council of the OPCW, meeting in the Netherlands.
The OPCW agreed to an "accelerated program for achieving the complete elimination of Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014," it said in a statement.
The official said that in order to meet international deadlines for destruction of Syria's chemical weapons, the group may opt for a "quick and dirty" program that would render the weapons unusable but wouldn't destroy them, the official said.
In his remarks Friday night, Ban called on both the Syrian government and rebels to stop the fighting.
Two Republican U.S. senators criticized the Security Council vote, saying it will do little to end the civil war.
The pair said al-Assad's forces will continue to "use every weapon in their arsenal short of chemical weapons" on the Syrian people while receiving outside assistance from Russia, Iran and Hezbollah while doing so.
