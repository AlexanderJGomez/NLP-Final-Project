Regardless of the other candidates' performances in New Hampshire or even what happens in the South Carolina primary next week, Mitt Romney is extremely likely to be the Republican nominee.
From 1980 to the present, no candidate who significantly trailed in party endorsements has won the nomination.
A few candidates have been nominated in years when no candidate took an early endorsement lead.
We got an excellent example of this in December when Newt Gingrich opened up a fairly large lead in Iowa and national polls.
On top of this, Republican pundits almost universally condemned Gingrich.
As chronicled by Nate Silver, Mitt Romney now has a big lead in Republican Party endorsements, giving him a huge advantage moving forward.
How did this happen?
Pawlenty likely miscalculated by dropping out after weak performances in debates and in the Iowa straw poll.
Which brings us to the second candidate who could have won support from Republican elites: Perry.
Still, Perry remains the only candidate besides Romney with nontrivial support from Republican elites.
