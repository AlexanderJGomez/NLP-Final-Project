KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Hundreds of excited music fans wait in line on the lookout for their favorite singers on a hit television show.
Mohseni, who started the country's top television network, Tolo TV, said he's just trying to revive Afghan culture after the fallow Taliban era when music and television were banned.
This is a commercial enterprise, and it's reflecting what people want," Mohseni said.
At the fourth-season finals this year, the audience included those who sat quietly as well as those who loudly cheered for contestants, including Naweed Forugh (who would be named the "Afghan Star" winner), Naweed Sabirpur, Mehran Gulzar and Elaha Sorur, the lone female finalist.
Afghanistan's guardians of Islamic values, the Ulema Council, protested that "Afghan Star" and Tolo TV's popular Indian soap operas were not part of Afghan culture.
That culture war can be seen on Tolo TV.
Mohseni said that "Afghan Star" pushes his country forward in subtle ways, for instance teaching a few valuable lessons in democracy.
In previous elimination rounds, losers sometimes stormed off the set, refusing to accept defeat.
Either way, Tolo TV has an avid audience: According to Mohseni, the finals of both "Afghan Star" and "Koran Star" won their nights' ratings races, easily beating the competition.
