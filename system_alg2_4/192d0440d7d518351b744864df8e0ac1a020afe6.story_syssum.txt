Sure, they had tried more than 40 times to get rid of the plan before, but they had never done this: Attach the plan to kill it to a must-pass piece of legislation.
They came back to Washington very angry at Cruz and Company.
So the plan to defund Obamacare -- and tie it to a measure to fund the government -- was hatched.
At that moment, Cruz morphed from the Pied Piper of House Republicans into the man on the Most Wanted sign.
So Cruz had no choice but to mount his own faux-filibuster, which went nowhere.
But a funny thing happened on the way to the national stage: The president decided not to cave, and Republicans treated this as if it were shocking that he would not gut his single biggest legislative achievement.
The White House refused to release reliable numbers so the public's level of participation could be gauged.
Great strategy.
Another great moment.
So Obamacare had a crashing start, the government is shut down, and the deadline to raise the debt ceiling is a week away.
So what to do?
Tie a package of spending cuts to raising the debt ceiling, he says.
That's what has always been done.
In the end, they will probably find a short-term way to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling and continue to argue over spending and taxes.
