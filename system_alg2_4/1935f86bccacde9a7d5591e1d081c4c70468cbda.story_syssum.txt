(CNN) -- A Michigan man was arraigned Saturday as part of an investigation into the deaths of women linked to a website that hosts ads for escort services.
Detroit police Chief Ralph Godbee later explained that one reason murder charges haven't been filed is that, while all the bodies were found in his city, the women weren't necessarily killed there.
At least three of the women placed advertisements dealing with "prearranged adult dating services" on Backpage.com, Godbee told reporters last December.
Around 6 a.m. Tuesday, authorities arrested Brown and "another black male, age 32" about 20 miles north of Detroit in Sterling Heights, Michigan, Detroit police said in a statement Saturday.
The other man was later released, police said, but the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office decided to press charges against Brown.
