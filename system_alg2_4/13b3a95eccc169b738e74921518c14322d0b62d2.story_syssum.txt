"It was a difficult stage, it was a nervous stage, but finally I'm so excited to win," said Cavendish.
Cavendish, who won his second stage this year and 25th all time, became embroiled in controversy Tuesday when he collided with Tom Veelers as part of a sprint finish.

"I was just behind Cav's wheel when he sprinted across.
"I knew I had a really good buffer already -- almost four minutes on Contador," said Froome.
"And okay, I worked really hard to get that time gap but you can't win them all.
