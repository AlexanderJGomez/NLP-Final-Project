Under the command of one of Libya's most well known rebel commanders, Al-Mahdi al-Harati, more than 30 Libyan fighters have made their way into Syria to support the Free Syrian Army rebels in their war against President Bashar al-Assad's regime.
In the past week, at least three more former members of the Tripoli Revolutionary Brigade traveled from the Libyan capital to join their former commander in Syria, two former members of the TRB says.
One year on, he dreams of fighting al-Assad's troops.
The Syrians need people to fight with them, this is Jihad, it does not have to be my (personal) cause ... As a Muslim I have to go and help them," he said.
We are not going to Jihad like al-Qaeda and others.
We are going to support our brothers in Syria," he said.
I can not sit back and watch that," Najjair told CNN in a Skype interview from one of Turkey's borders with Syria hours before making the dangerous journey into Syria.
Najjair says the no-fly zone enforced in Libya last year helped rebel fighters and allowed them to make great advances.
Last month, a senior Libyan security official told CNN the government was aware of Libyans fighting in Syria, but they were individuals and not government sponsored.
But Libya's government and people have been vocal in their support for the Syrian opposition.
In a YouTube video posted on July 4, a group of six Libyan doctors is seen being greeted by Free Syrian Army troops as they enter Syria.
In February, reports of at least four Libyan fighters killed in Syria circulated, but there has been no government confirmation.
If it's not my time it will be another amazing journey another amazing victory.""
