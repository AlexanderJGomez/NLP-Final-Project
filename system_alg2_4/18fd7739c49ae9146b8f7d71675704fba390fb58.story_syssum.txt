The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights also said it deplores the kidnappings, arbitrary detentions, torture, sexual violations and illegal raids that the panel maintains other members of the political resistance have suffered since the June 29 coup.
Honduras returned to democracy in January, and the newly installed government of President Porfirio Lobo Sosa bears responsibility for safeguarding civil liberties and human rights, the commission said.
Human rights will be respected under Lobo, who was elected in November and assumed the presidency January 27, national Police Commissioner Leonel Sauceda said Monday.
The OAS commission said that one of the recently killed activists was 29-year-old Vanessa Zepeda Alonzo, who was found February 3.
The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights also expressed concern that activists' family members are being threatened and harassed, with two of them killed in the past few weeks.
"Days before she was found hanged, Dara Gudiel had been released after having been kidnapped and held for two days, during which time she was alleged to have been physically mistreated," the panel's report said.
"The five were forced at gunpoint to walk into the mountains, where two of the women were sexually violated; the third was the victim of robbery and death threats, and the two men were subjected to physical torture," the report said.
The violence can be political, from all sides of the spectrum.
Poverty, gangs and low apprehension and conviction rates contribute to a critical crime rate, including mass slayings, the State Department said.
But political violence deserves special attention to safeguard democracy, the OAS panel said.
Reich said he hopes the OAS report does not blame the new government for the violence.
The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is an autonomous panel created by the OAS.
They are elected by the OAS General Assembly.
