Lille, France (CNN) -- Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka each faced questions heading into Switzerland's Davis Cup final in France.
I started to feel better as the match went on.
Also encouraging for Federer and the Swiss, Wawrinka thumped a listless Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-1 3-6 6-3 6-2 to begin the day.
"Definitely one of the top three matches in my life," said Monfils, who squandered two match points against Federer at the U.S. Open.
He earned the key break at 2-2 in the third in breath-taking fashion, slamming a forehand down the line and later in the game sliding into his backhand prior to sending it past Federer and down the line.
"I know how to play those matches," Wawrinka said.
For large parts of the affair he targeted Tsonga's backhand with his own sublime one-handed backhand, easily getting the better of the 2008 Australian Open finalist.
Wawrinka stormed to the first set and when he held a break point to begin the second, it appeared as if the Swiss No.
The loudest the crowd got in the opener was in that third set, when an agitated Tsonga implored them off their feet when he saved a set point with an ace at 2-5.
Tsonga was annoyed with his performance but also with the French fans, who he felt weren't vocal enough.
"I just went to check the mark, and I was booed in my own country -- maybe not by the French spectators but by the Swiss spectators.
"Now I'm coming out of the match without any pain, which is good, too," said Federer.
If I play the doubles and the singles, it needs to be a lot better than today.
