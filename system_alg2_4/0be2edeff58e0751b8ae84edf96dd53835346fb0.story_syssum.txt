In a video posted online Friday, the blind activist recounted the brutal treatment he and his family received during confinement.
One of the two, a young man who declined to give his name, said: "It was all over Weibo for a while before the topic was censored."
They also get creative in Chinese cyberspace to evade censors, especially on the popular Sina Weibo site, where a third of China's more than 500 million internet users share news and information.
Then people tried Abing, the famous early 20th Century Chinese musician who was also blind.
CNN, like most other international news media, has followed Chen's story for years and provided extensive coverage on his situation since his escape.
One of the tags for the video was "Chen Guangcheng."
Since Friday, eight of my last ten Weibo posts have fallen victim to the site's censors.
By Monday afternoon, "StevenCNN" -- my Weibo name -- has become a banned search term.
