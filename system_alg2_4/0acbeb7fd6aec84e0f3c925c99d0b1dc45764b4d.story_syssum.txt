That seems to be the lesson young athletes learn from the latest steroids scandal.
What's most troubling about this affair is how many of today's young people believe cheating might be the only way to break through in sports.
These young athletes need to hear more about Taylor Hooton than Ryan Braun.
That's what we have here.
They can go online and find dozens of websites that offer to sell anabolic steroids and other PEDs online.
Teenagers know how to find just what they think they need on YouTube, eBay and other websites that parents haven't even heard of.
It's also important to pay attention to Internet and credit card use.
Many teenagers have credit cards, which can be easily used to purchase PEDs online.
Make sure young athletes hear the whole story.
But the real risk for young athletes is their health.
When they use PEDs, they are risking their lives and their health.
