Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama signed an executive order Monday designed to help reduce a growing number of prescription drug shortages while protecting patients from possible pharmaceutical industry price gouging.
Obama administration officials have also sent a letter to drug manufacturers "reminding them of their responsibility to report the discontinuation of certain drugs to the FDA," the statement noted.
Drug manufacturers are being encouraged to voluntarily disclose possible prescription drug shortages in instances not currently required by law.
The total number of prescription drug shortages almost tripled from 2005 to 2010, the White House noted.
"One of the reasons why we can't wait is because Congress won't act," Carney said.
