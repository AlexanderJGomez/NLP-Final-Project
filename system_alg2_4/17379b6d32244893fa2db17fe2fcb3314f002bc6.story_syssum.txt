Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has blamed Grupo Clarin for her low approval ratings.
This bill is "for everyone who wants to live in a more democratic and more pluralistic Argentina," Fernandez de Kirchner said in a speech last month.
"[Cristina] Kirchner saw [Clarin] as a limit to her power, and this was the origin of the conflict," Argentine political analyst Rosendo Fraga said.
Among the changes proposed in the bill, a company that owns a cable business would not be allowed to own any over-the-air broadcast channels.
"More control of the media by the government, this is the main motivation," Kerner said.
If anyone is applying unfair pressure, it is monopolistic media companies, Fernandez de Kirchner said.
In response, Fernandez de Kirchner has come out swinging at the Clarin newspaper and its parent company, observers said.
Last month, the government pushed the nation's soccer association to rescind a contract it had with Clarin to broadcast games.
The editor bristles at the characterization of the bill as part of conflict between his newspaper and the government.
It's paradoxical."
