AVA Solar CEO Pascal Noronha holds one of the solar panels his company produces.
Once production is up to speed, CEO Pascal Noronha says, the plant should create enough solar panels a year to power 40,000 U.S. homes.
Noronha says AVA Solar needs two things: Government loans to expand its factory, and more government assistance to help power companies commit to building large solar power plants in the United States.
Without the stimulus, Noronha said, AVA Solar is on track to create 420 new jobs by the end of this year.
"What everybody needs is a little seed money because five years from now there's no question [that] solar has to replace the oil that we import," Noronha says.

"The government needs to be able to facilitate these customers by making it possible for them to put large-scale power plants up."
And there are two forms that are promising -- one is wind and the other is solar.
