Manama, Bahrain (CNN) -- Security forces in Bahrain stormed the main hospital, beating doctors, and attacked demonstrators in Manama's Pearl Roundabout on Wednesday, witnesses in the Bahraini capital said.
In a statement Wednesday, Bahrain's government said that as police approached the roundabout, they were attacked by protesters -- whom they call "saboteurs" -- who threw Molotov cocktails at them.
The crackdown comes a day after Bahrain's King Hamad imposed a three-month state of emergency and two days after Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates dispatched troops to the Persian Gulf island nation to "protect the safety of citizens," the Bahraini government said.
Security forces then stormed the hospital and beat staffers, several doctors there said.
Doctors have been hiding in rooms, said Yousif Sharaf, a doctor at the hospital.
"This is a government hospital.
Haji said two people had died in the hospital Wednesday morning, and she feared for the other patients there because the doctors were not able to work.
The Bahraini government expelled CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom from the country Wednesday without explanation.
We could see tear gas being dispersed," Jamjoom said.
Officials at another private hospital, Salmany Hospital, also said they were being besieged by troops.
The Bahraini government denied the allegations and said foreign troops had been dispatched to secure specific installations, not participate in the crackdown.
At least two protesters were killed, and at least 150 people were wounded, according to medical officials on the scene.
"The world is watching to see whether Bahrain will respect the basic rights of all its citizens."
