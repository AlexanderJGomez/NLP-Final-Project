(CNN) -- I hate public speaking.
It sounds so obvious but it makes a huge difference.
After all, I have been doing this sort of stuff for quite some time.
Most broadcasters speak and breathe from the throat.
RADA was going to put that right.
From deep down below, right to the bottom of the belly, to allow the air to carry the sound out of my mouth.
It seemed to work.
I have been told I sound like gargling with broken glass, although I can't hear that.
I needed to be more aware in my style, less thrusting into the audience's face.
I was so busy trying to remember what I was supposed to be doing, I would forget what I was supposed to be saying and what came next.
Fifteen minutes of movement and breathing before I do a presentation works wonders.
I will never really like standing in front of a large audience, hoping they will like me (a therapist would have a field day with that comment) but at least I am no longer nervous to the point of going to the bathroom multiple times just to get away.
