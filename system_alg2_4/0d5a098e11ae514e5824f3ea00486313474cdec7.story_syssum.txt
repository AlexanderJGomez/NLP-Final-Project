There's a new league in town, and it's all about fast and furious fitness.
DailyBurn went Grid-side as the New York Rhinos faced off against the Los Angeles Reign to witness the action at the first match of the inaugural 2014 season.
Next came a traditional style draft in July, where coaches from the eight squads selected the best men and women for their rosters â€” factoring in not just their combine performance and fitness resume, but also personality and overall "fit" for the team.
The action takes place on a 94-by-50-foot grid, split up into eight quadrants (four for each team) plus a start and finish area.
Races -- some of which are coed, some of which are male or female-only -- can include anything from handstand push-ups, burpee box jumps, rope climbs and double-unders for time.
For each battle, the winning team gets two points (exception being the last race which counts for three points), and the losing team gets one.
"When you're competing as an individual you can find your own pace and if you mess up, you have a longer time to make up for it," says Annie Thorsidottir, captain of the New York Rhinos.
Rhinos co-captain Mat Fraser, who also earned second place at the 2014 CrossFit Games, says the relentless speed is something Grid athletes, himself included, will need to adjust to.
I have never done 20 burpees over a box that fast... " Fraser says of the 9th race, one of the more challenging from his first match.
According to Budding, there's plenty of potential for the players, too, stating that one of the many goals with this new league is to make functional fitness something the best in the world can finally make a living at.
Until then, fans can watch regular season match-ups on NPGL.com via web broadcast.
There's always next year's Grid League Combine.
