(CNN) -- The medical examiner's office in Concord, New Hampshire, will conduct an autopsy Tuesday on the body of Celina Cass to determine how the 11-year-old girl died.
Young said that the case -- which had been considered a "missing persons" case -- is now being investigated as a "suspicious death."
Celina's body was found around 10:30 a.m. Monday by divers from the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department near a hydroelectric plant outside West Stewartstown, New Hampshire, according to the attorney general's office.
The discovery came a day after Laro -- who was in the hospital when Celina went missing -- said that he was like others "wondering where my daughter is" and hoping she was safe.
"I ... can't believe what's gone on," Laro said on Monday.
CNN affiliate WMUR reported that her parents told authorities the girl was gone when they went to wake her up.
Celina's father said that he had not spoken with his ex-wife, who lived in the house with the girl's stepfather of about a year, since the girl went missing.
"(It was) a household that supposedly gave her great love, that's what she always told me," Laro said Monday.
