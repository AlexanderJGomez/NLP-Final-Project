While Bush campaigned for 2014 candidates last year, he didn't hit the early primary states like Iowa and New Hampshire, which hold the first two nominating contests and where other potential presidential contenders have already made frequent visits.
Bush only recently announced that he's "actively" exploring a presidential bid, and his team and supporters have quickly started organizing behind the scenes to form political action committees that will help him travel to meet with voters and donors as he also campaigns for non-presidential candidates.
"If you're not willing to speak to a conservative group that even Chris Christie is willing to speak to, you're probably in the wrong party," Deace said in an interview.
Republican strategist and Bush supporter Ana Navarro, who's also a CNN contributor, said Bush is focused on fundraising and organizing but added voters can expect Bush do some public events in the coming weeks.
Campbell told the Wall Street Journal that Bush "will travel to states around the country in the coming months to support conservative candidates and causes."
