Roswell, New Mexico (CNN) -- A skydiver's historic free-fall from the stratosphere was called off Tuesday due to wind gusts that ruined the helium balloon set to hoist him to high altitude for the record-breaking attempt.
However, as Baumgartner waited in the capsule to be carried up to high altitude, another wind gust whipped the more than 500-foot-tall white balloon and ruined it for the mission.
"There's a lot riding on that, so the main thing for us is making sure the probability is very high," Thompson said.
When the launch occurs, Baumgartner expects to spend two or three hours on the ascent in a capsule hanging from the helium balloon.
The attempt has serious risks.
While reaching such speeds can cause stress on an aircraft, planners for this jump believe there will be little effect on Baumgartner because he will be at an altitude at which there is so little air that shock waves are barely transmitted.
You know, I'm living a good life.
BASE is an acronym for buildings, antennas, spans and Earth -- the four things from which you can jump.
You have to be focused.
Otherwise, you're gonna die."
Baumgartner was not doing interviews leading up to the jump, but his performance coach, Andy Walshe, described him as mentally well-prepared.
The record for such a jump is currently held by Col. Joe Kittinger, who in 1960 jumped from 102,800 feet as part of a U.S. Air Force mission.
For example, he described what it feels like to fall through space when there is so little air: "There's no way you can tell how fast you're going, because there's no visual cues."
"He's advancing science, and he'll do a great job."
