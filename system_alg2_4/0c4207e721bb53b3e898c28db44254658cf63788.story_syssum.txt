A man claiming to be Abubakar Shekau made the comments in a video posted online on Saturday, saying the group attacked a bus station in retaliation for the what he described as the government's collusion with the United States in the killing of Muslims.
The video surfaced the same day that an education official said a Nigerian schoolgirl, who was among the 129 kidnapped Monday by suspected Boko Haram militants, had returned home.
This is a far cry from the Defense Ministry's previous report that all but eight of the girls had found freedom, a claim that Nigeria's military retracted Thursday.
But nowhere has it been more prevalent that in northeastern Nigeria's Borno, Yobe and Adamawa provinces, which have been under a state of emergency since mid-May due to persistent bloodshed there the government blames on Boko Haram.
Under Shekau, who took control of the group in 2009, violence carried out by the group has flourished, according to authorities.
He uses the alias Darul Tawheed, and analysts describe him as a ruthless loner and master of disguise.
