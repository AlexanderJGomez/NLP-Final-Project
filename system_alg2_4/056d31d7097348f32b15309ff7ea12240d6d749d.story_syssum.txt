(CNN) -- The state visit of the President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins to Britain this week is the culmination of a series of contacts at head of state level over 21 years, the most important of which was the successful State visit by Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh to Ireland in May 2011.
This was one illustration of the fact that relations between the two countries were not normal because of the disputed claims at the time by Britain and Ireland over Northern Ireland.
This was neither a "state visit" or an "official visit"; it was a sui generis, carefully orchestrated meeting at head-of-state level between two countries with a troubled past seeking, in a symbolic way, to begin reconciling.
There is understandable anticipation on both sides of the Irish Sea for the return state visit of Higgins to Britain next week.
The Good Friday Agreement was signed during the first year of McAleese's presidency and, being from Northern Ireland, she was able to support in symbolic and diplomatic ways the further progress in establishing peace and shared political power in Northern Ireland.
The Northern Ireland referendum, to approve the agreement was held on the same day as the Irish referendum thereby symbolizing that the citizens of the land had the power to realize a change.
When I can, I will be glued to a television set, hoping to see coverage of a state visit that will evoke many memories and bring about the full normalization of the relations between two close and historic neighbors.
