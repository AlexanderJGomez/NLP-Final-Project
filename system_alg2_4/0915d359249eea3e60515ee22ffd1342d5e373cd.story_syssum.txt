Android grew its already significant chunk of the smartphone market to 68.8% last year, while Apple's iOS operating system stayed comfortably in second place with 18.8% of smartphone shipments, according to new stats from research firm IDC.
Apple released one new iOS phone in 2012, the much-anticipated iPhone 5.
Samsung sold 384.6 million phones in 2012, only 53.5% of which were smartphones, according to Gartner.
BlackBerry just released its long-awaited new smartphone operating system and two new handsets in January, and Microsoft debuted its Windows Phone 8 update at the end of 2012.
Unlike BlackBerry, Windows Phone 8 unveiled its new products and marketing campaign early enough to make some progress last year.
Overall, the number of phone sales in 2012 actually dropped 1.7% from the previous year, the first drop since 2009.
