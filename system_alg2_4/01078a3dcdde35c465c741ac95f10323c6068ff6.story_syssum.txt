He said the gunman then turned away from him, distracted by gunfire from the civilian police officers who had rushed to the scene.
"I remember saying to the police officer, 'He is one of us,'" Richter said.
The gun was jammed, he said, and he burned his fingers on the barrel as he tried to clear it.
And Army investigators said Wednesday that the gunman still had 177 rounds on him when he was shot by police.
"I challenged him, 'Halt, military police, drop your weapon,'" Todd said.
No," Munley said.
A separate police car "dash-cam" was introduced during Todd's testimony, but because of a technical glitch there was no audio.
Munley said she exchanged fire with the gunman and was injured herself.
After she was wounded three times, Munley was on the ground and her police weapon "malfunctioned," she testified.
He did not shoot her again and Munley said he appeared to be having problems with his own weapon.
During the period of the final shots, Todd made repeated calls for Hasan to drop his gun.
In the end, Hasan fell to the ground, and Todd ran up, kicked his gun away, turned him over on his stomach and searched him.
Army Criminal Investigation Division officer Duane Mitchell said 177 unexpended rounds were recovered from Hasan in both 30- and 20-round magazines.
The prosecution said it planned to complete presenting its case on Thursday.
An Article 32 hearing determines if there is enough evidence to proceed to a court-martial.
