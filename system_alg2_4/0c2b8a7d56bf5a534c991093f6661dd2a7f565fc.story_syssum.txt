Oscar Hernandez, the mayor of Bell, California, said the City Council accepted the resignations of City Manager Robert Rizzo, Assistant City Manager Angela Spaccia, and Police Chief Randy Adams, who reportedly had a combined salary of more than $1.6 million.
"We recognize that today's economic climate and the financial hardships so many families are suffering put our past compensation decisions in a new light.
"These outrageous salaries in Bell are shocking and beyond belief," he said.
Cory Christ, a resident of the city, said to CNN affiliate KTLA.

"Just to put it in context, the general fund for the city of Bell is $15 million.
So, Mr. Rizzo with his salary and compensation package, around $800,000 is about one-fifteenth of the budget for the city of Bell," De La Torre said.
Hernandez said the salaries "have been in line with similar positions over the period of their tenure" and that Rizzo gave the town 15 years of balanced budgets after a $20 million shortfall.
