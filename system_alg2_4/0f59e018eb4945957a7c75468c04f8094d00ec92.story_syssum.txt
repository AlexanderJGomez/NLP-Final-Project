The medical examiner at the time determined the cause of death "due to the clear visibility of his protruding ribs, sunken cheeks and emaciated body," according to the documents.
"When he finally died of malnutrition, the sisters wheeled him in a baby carriage to an abandoned building where he was discovered two days later," one of the documents states.
Two years later, after being hospitalized, she was certified by the court and found guilty of voluntary manslaughter and criminal conspiracy, according to Philadelphia police and court documents.
The case continued to develop Friday when CNN uncovered new information that shows the Philadelphia case was not the first time Weston has drawn scrutiny for possible Social Security fraud.
The acknowledgment by the inspector general's office has raised questions about why the Social Security Administration allowed Weston, a convicted murderer, to serve as a "representative payee" for a Social Security recipient.
After initially asking for questions for comment in writing from CNN, a spokeswoman for the administration declined to provide details of the Weston case, including whether Weston was the representative payee for any of the people found in captivity in Philadelphia.
According to police, Weston, who was caring for Lee, reported her death on November 13, 2008.
The physician who conducted Lee's autopsy has reviewed the autopsy report and "hasn't come to any other conclusions" about the cause of death, said Glenn McBride, spokesman for the Tidewater office of the Virginia Medical Examiner's Office.
At the time of Lee's death, police say they did not know that Weston had served time for murder.
