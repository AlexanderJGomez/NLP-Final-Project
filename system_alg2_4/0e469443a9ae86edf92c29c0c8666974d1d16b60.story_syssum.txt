Human rights groups decried the court ruling that spared Duvalier.
In February, a Haitian appeals court ruled that the lower court was wrong and that there is no statute of limitations for human rights violations.
In addition, there were allegations that "Baby Doc" embezzled hundreds of millions of dollars.
Amnesty gave the public prosecutor in the Duvalier case 100 documents that it said detailed cases of human rights violations.
