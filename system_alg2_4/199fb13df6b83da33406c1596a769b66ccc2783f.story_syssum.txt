But on Saturday night in Dubuque, Iowa, roughly 130 people showed up to see Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont talk about elevating the middle class, nationalizing health care and fighting the degrading influence of money in politics.

"I think the Democratic party needs to move a little bit to the liberal, progressive side," said Marcos Rubinstein, who organized Dennis Kucinich's 2008 Iowa campaign.
"Clearly ISIS is a terrorist organization, a brutal organization, a dangerous organization," Sanders told CNN, before he quickly turned to a topic he is more comfortable about: the middle class and the economy.

Sanders ended his speech with a call to action, urging attendees to begin a conversation and organize support in northeast Iowa for the issues he was addressing.
