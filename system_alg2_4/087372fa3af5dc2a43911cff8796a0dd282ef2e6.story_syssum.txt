The minister, Ali al-Amrani, was headed to the prime minister's office when the attack occurred, spokesman Abdul Basit al-Qaedi told CNN.
The minister's office said al-Amrani has been targeted recently in a hate campaign by pro-revolution groups.
The minister recently launched a massive presidential campaign to support candidate Abdurabu Hadi, the country's current vice president.
Yemen has been beset with demonstrations against President Ali Abdullah Saleh since early last year, when pro-democratic uprisings spread across the Arab world.
