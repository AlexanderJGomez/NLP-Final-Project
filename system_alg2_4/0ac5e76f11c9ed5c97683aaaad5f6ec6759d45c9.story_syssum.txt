But in December, an unnamed FBI whistle-blower accused prosecutors of withholding evidence from the defense, and the Justice Department asked a judge to dismiss the charges against Stevens on Wednesday.
Sullivan said the Justice Department was forced to request the dismissal because of "extraordinary evidence of government corruption."
In a statement issued Wednesday morning, Stevens thanked the Justice Department and Attorney General Eric Holder for requesting that the charges be dropped.
U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan has set a Tuesday hearing on the Justice Department's request to dismiss the case.
In the motion it filed Wednesday, the Justice Department acknowledged that Stevens was not given access to notes taken by prosecutors during an April 2008 interview with Allen, the former chairman of an oilfield services company at the center of a corruption probe in Alaska.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, also commented on the Justice Department's request, saying, "Ted Stevens is 85 years old.
He's already been punished enough.
Senator Stevens ... never gave up hope.
The Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility will review the prosecution team's conduct in Stevens' case, Holder said.
During the trial, Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich said Stevens hid "hundreds of thousands of dollars of freebies" he received from Allen's company, VECO, and from Allen himself.
