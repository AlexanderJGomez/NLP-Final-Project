He said earlier in a statement that he was sorry for the trouble he has caused, said New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly.
Police found human remains in Aron's freezer and a trash bin which they believe are those of the boy, who went missing Monday afternoon.
Police said Aron, 35, made statements Wednesday implicating himself in the death of Kletzky.
A cause of death has yet to be determined but police believe Kletzky was suffocated.
Aron claims he took Kletzky to a wedding Monday night in Monsey, New York, and then brought him back, Kelly said.
Aron, a clerk at a maintenance supply company, did not appear to have known Kletzky, Kelly said.
Kelly said that statements made by the suspect indicated that he kidnapped Kletzky and, as a neighborhood search for the boy intensified, he became panicked and killed him.
He also enjoyed karaoke.
"Even as I talked to him not long ago, everything was fine, no indications that anything was wrong."
