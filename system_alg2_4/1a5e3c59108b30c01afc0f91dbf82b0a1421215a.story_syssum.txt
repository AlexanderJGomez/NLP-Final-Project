Razgui supports himself and his family playing these instruments.
A spokesperson from U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Razgui did not claim his bag at JFK.
The spokesperson said agriculture specialists did not find or destroy any instruments, only fresh bamboo.
While he is sad to lose the instruments and the materials, he said he would have forfeited the reeds he purchased in Morocco if it meant keeping his instruments.
The Customs spokesperson, however, said agriculture specialists neither found nor destroyed any instruments.
"I don't know what to do; I need my materials to make my living," he said.
He said he made all of the instruments himself.
"Right now I don't have a job; I don't know what to do."
The Customs spokesperson said any passenger who has an issue can file a report online or contact Homeland Security.
