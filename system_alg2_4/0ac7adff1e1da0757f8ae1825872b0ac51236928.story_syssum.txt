Since civil war broke out there, 310,000 people have been killed, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Thursday.
Violence has plunged well over half of all Syrians into such destitution that they are in dire need of survival aid, the United Nations says, as food rations are being cut for lack of donations.
The number of Syrians in need of immediate life-saving aid, according to the U.N.  That's the population of Moscow.
Turkey has taken in 1.7 million, Lebanon 1.2 million, Jordan 625,000, and Iraq 245,000.
That means people receiving aid will get only 60% of the daily nutrition they need.
