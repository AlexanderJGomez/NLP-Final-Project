(CNN) -- A 19-year-old gunman who killed eight people and then himself Wednesday at the Westroads Mall in Omaha, Nebraska, left a suicide note, police said.
Police identified the gunman as Robert A. Hawkins of Nebraska.
Seven people were found dead at the scene by officers arriving six minutes later; two others, a male and a female, died after being transported to Creighton University Medical Center, said Fire Chief Robert Dahlquist.
One, a 61-year-old man who sustained a chest wound after being shot in the armpit, underwent surgery and remained in critical condition in the intensive care unit Wednesday night, said hospital spokeswoman Maggie O'Brien.
"He just said he wanted to thank me for everything I'd done for him ... and he was sorry," Maruca Kovac said.
"He said, 'It's too late.'
"He just kept firing," she said.
"I was scared to death he'd be walking around looking for someone else."
Warren, the police chief, said the victims included five females and three males, not including Hawkins.
However, she said Hawkins and his girlfriend had broken up in the last couple of weeks, and he had taken it hard.
"We're all in shock."
Witnesses described chaos and frantic shoppers running away from the Von Maur store, where the shooting began just before 2 p.m.
