NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN)  -- Former Sen. John Edwards dropped out of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination Wednesday, leaving his voters up for grabs.
Senior Edwards aides said Edwards called Clinton and Obama to tell them he was considering dropping out of the race and asked them to make poverty a central issue of the general election and a future Democratic administration, something both agreed to do.
You could also make the argument that there's a lot of support out there amongst people that will go to Hillary," he said.
Time magazine journalist Joe Klein said, "I don't think he endorses Hillary Clinton.
Edwards announced he was dropping out Wednesday afternoon in New Orleans, the same city where he declared his run for the 2008 Democratic presidential race.
Campaign money was not an issue, the aide said.

"John Edwards ended his campaign today in the same way he started it -- by standing with the people who are too often left behind and nearly always left out of our national debate," Clinton said in a statement.
Klein said Edwards played a positive role in spurring his competitors during the early part of the campaign.
One Edwards aide said he is not dropping out of the race because of his wife's health.
Before entering politics, winning a Senate seat from North Carolina in 1998, Edwards was a lawyer representing families "being victimized by powerful interests" and gaining "a national reputation as a forceful and tireless champion for regular, hard-working people," according to his campaign Web site.
