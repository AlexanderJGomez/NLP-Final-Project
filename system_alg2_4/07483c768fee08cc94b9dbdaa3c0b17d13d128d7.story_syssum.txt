Juba, South Sudan (CNN) -- A large group of youths from an ethnic militia loyal to former South Sudanese Vice President Riek Machar is marching for the city of Bor, just days after it was retaken by the government amid heavy fighting, officials said.
Multiple media outlets reported Machar denied the youths are acting under his orders.
Machar is a longtime rival of President Salva Kiir.
Fighting broke out between Kiir's government and supporters of Machar on December 15 in the capital city of Juba.
If they don't, the leaders of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development warned they'll "take action" to stop the conflict that the United Nations says has killed more than 1,000 and forced some 121,000 from their homes.
The warning came the same day the United Nations said the first of 5,500 additional peacekeepers had arrived in the country.
