That personal app grew into Weduary, a real product that helps people design wedding sites, and Morin went on to create her own lifestyle how-to company called Brit + Co., which combines crafting, homemaking and a bit of tech.
For $20 a month, Brit + Co. will deliver a Brit Kit box filled with crafting materials and instructions for projects such as gloves that work on touchscreen devices.
One of Morin's favorite recent projects was an LED cowboy hat she wore to the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas.
She worked with Yahoo CEO Mayer in the past, and Mayer is an investor in Brit + Co.
In an effort to differentiate herself from the doyennes of DIY like Stewart, Morin avoids saying the word "craft," which she thinks makes people think of popsicle sticks.
And she is constantly promoting the brand in magazines and on TV programs.
"In the past it was Disney, Rockefeller, Walmart; all these huge companies that have lasted for decades had a person's name in the brand."
Morin says that, like her, the current generation is interested in homemaking and DIY, but suffers from a lack of time and proper training.
Morin says that with so many people 35 and younger growing up with two working parents, there's been less time for passing on cooking, crafting and DIY techniques.
