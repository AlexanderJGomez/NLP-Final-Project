Islamabad (CNN) -- Pakistan's former president Pervez Musharraf is back in Pakistan after years of self-imposed exile and is facing a hard time from courts in Pakistan amid a range of charges, including claims he illegally placed senior judges under house arrest during a period of emergency rule he imposed in 2007.
He did so under the false belief that he might still be popular among the people and that he might be able to reclaim power in the upcoming elections.
The Supreme Court has ordered Musharraf to appear before them on charges of treason, a crime punishable by death in Pakistan.
It is, therefore, no surprise that Musharraf has chosen now to speak out about U.S. drone strikes.
He has given President Barack Obama's administration a much-needed headline of Pakistani support for U.S. drone strikes.
Under the Obama administration, Pakistan's parliament, in two different sessions, has declared the strikes both illegal and counter-productive.
The reality is drones -- with or without consent -- are a seductive option for the leader of the free world.
Even more seductive is the ability to wage war without oversight.
Obama campaigned and was elected on a platform of change, one that would end the abuses and torture so prevalent during the early years of the so-called war on terror.
More than four years later, the "change" Obama has brought to Pakistan through drones has resulted in more needless deaths, daily suicide attacks, and growing instability.
