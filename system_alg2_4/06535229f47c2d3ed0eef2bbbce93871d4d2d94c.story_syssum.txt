(CNN) -- Shortly after 1:30 p.m. on February 24, 2010, a SeaWorld Orlando trainer lost her life in a tragic accident involving one of the park's killer whales.
The three years since Dawn's death have seen the emergence of individuals who have chosen not to honor her memory, but rather to use the events of February 24, 2010, to advance their own interests.
But anyone approaching this subject in good faith must recognize a simple fact: Our staff has interacted with killer whales -- for veterinary care, training, shows, educational presentations, husbandry, exercise, play and enrichment -- hundreds of times a day for nearly 50 years.
Not one word about the thousands of ill, orphaned and injured animals rescued by SeaWorld or the millions of dollars we dedicate to supporting conservation and research.
In the three years since Dawn's death, we have again made significant changes at SeaWorld.
The care and educational presentation of these animals at SeaWorld has been made safer than ever.
No, it does not.
Blackfish, like other works driven by the same agenda, ignores the extraordinary benefits to conservation, scientific research and education of America's zoo and aquariums.
Despite what the makers of this film may suggest, SeaWorld is the kind of organization that draws dedicated and passionate people like Dawn Brancheau.
