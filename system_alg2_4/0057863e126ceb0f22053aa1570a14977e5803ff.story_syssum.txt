One hundred Labor caucus members had been due to vote, but in the end, no votes were cast because there were no candidates beyond Gillard for prime minister, and Wayne Swan as her deputy.
Minutes before the meeting of Australian Labor Party (ALP) caucus members, former leader Kevin Rudd made it clear that he would not be pitting himself against his former rival.
Gillard called the vote for 4:30 p.m. local time (1:30 a.m.
Before the vote, Crean said he wouldn't be nominating himself as leader, but would take the job of deputy.
The Welsh-born politician secured enough support from the Australian Greens Party, and independents, to form a minority government.
In January, Gillard surprised the country by calling an election for September 14, the longest lead time for an Australian election in history.
