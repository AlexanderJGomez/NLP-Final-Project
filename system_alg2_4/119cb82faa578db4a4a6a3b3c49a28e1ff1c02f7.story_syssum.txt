A French excavation team was working at the Caribbean Supermarket on Tuesday.
But at 11 p.m. Tuesday, the teams determined there was no one else alive under the rubble, and they called off the rescue mission, Renou told CNN Wednesday.
At one point, he said, a female Mexican rescue worker was trapped under the rubble and teams had to work to save her life.
Caribbean Supermarket was the scene of a number of rescues after the earthquake, including the rescue of five people in one weekend.
