Named after the Bridge of the Americas that connects El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, the show explores the real-world tensions along the border through the story of two detective agents -- one from the United States and one from Mexico -- who must work together to hunt down a serial killer who is terrorizing citizens on both sides.
Like "Bron," "The Bridge's" pilot episode opens with a gruesome murder and a body splayed in the middle of the bridge joining both nations.
Filmmaker Gerardo Naranjo, known for his critically-acclaimed drug trafficking film "Miss Bala," directed the pilot episode and told CNN the drama's authentic take on the U.S.-Mexican border is what sets it apart from other productions.
Aside from being a Mexican national, Naranjo brought a wealth of border knowledge to the director's chair.
"I had a conversation with my producers and writers and that was the first thing that got me hooked on it -- the promise of it being real," he said.
"The Bridge's" setting alongside the El Paso-Ciudad Juarez border allows the show to seamlessly navigate between both the entertainment and political world.
"When we first starting thinking about the show, we knew we had a huge potential opportunity with the Hispanic audience," Sally Daws, FX's senior vice president of marketing, told CNN.
'The Bridge' is a great bet," Naranjo said to CNN.
