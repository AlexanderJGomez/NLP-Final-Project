Correa said Ecuador would be cautious about processing any asylum request from Snowden.
"We need to be very realistic.
Correa said that the first ones to be consulted "would be the U.S. as we did in the Assange case with England."
Correa said neither he nor officials in Quito authorized travel documents that diplomats in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London issued to Snowden.
The document "was issued without our knowledge," and he blamed the consul in London, Correa said.
Ecuador is turning down trade benefits given by the United States as part of the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act, Ecuadorian officials said.
The South American country is now in the international spotlight as a global manhunt continues for Snowden, a fugitive who has admitted leaking classified documents about U.S. surveillance programs.
