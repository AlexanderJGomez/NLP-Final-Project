The offbeat TV series, created by David Lynch and Mark Frost, will be returning to television in 2016, according to a strange (of course) video posted on Showtime's YouTube channel.
Lynch and Frost will write and produce each one and Lynch will direct all nine.
The tone was set with Angelo Badalamenti's ghostly theme music.
In addition to MacLachlan, the show starred Ray Wise, Lara Flynn Boyle, Peggy Lipton and Joan Chen.
"What more can I say -- 'Twin Peaks' with David Lynch and Mark Frost on Showtime in 2016!"
"To quote Agent Cooper, 'I have no idea where this will lead us, but I have a definite feeling it will be a place both wonderful and strange.'"
