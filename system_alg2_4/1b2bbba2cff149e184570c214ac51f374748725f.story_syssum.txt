Because Antarctic ice sheets are melting, the sea level is likely to rise "unstoppably" by at least 10 feet, dooming many coastal towns and displacing millions of people.
Who.
Will there even be people centuries from now?
The next 200, 500 years, are not for us to worry about.
"A large sector of the West Antarctic ice sheet has gone into irreversible retreat," according to Eric Rignot, a glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine, who led one of the teams.
Warming air is intensifying the winds that sweep round the Antarctic, but it's not warming air that is melting the glaciers there.
So far, sea level rise worldwide has been caused mainly by the heat-caused expansion of seawater, much more than melting ice.
But melting land ice will have a big effect on sea level rise.
And so will we all.
The only wrinkle in that thought is that centuries ago, about 225 years ago to be more precise, some people wrote a Constitution and Bill of Rights that affect our lives every day and that we refer to daily to guide us legally and morally.
Some of us will be alive then.
Many of us will have children who will live to this century's finish line.
Another speaks of misery caused in Bangladesh by rising seas, where 18 million people will be displaced in the next 40 years by rising seawater or having their well-water and farms ruined by salt.
It doesn't matter whether they live around the block or in the next state or in the future.
When I was in high school in the 1970s, I learned that we were too dependent on other countries for energy, and that oil and coal are non-renewable and polluting, and that we needed to begin a shift to harnessing clean renewable energy sources.
Globally, we're not exactly coming together to stabilize climate and institutionalize clean energy.
I think we could do what's needed.
Too often, we're in denial.
So, let's not worry about the people of Bangladesh, Kiribati, New York and Miami, or the 23rd century.
