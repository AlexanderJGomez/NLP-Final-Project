Pastor Ted Haggard acknowledged on CNN's "Larry King Live" that he had a second relationship with a man.
Haggard, 52, said the incident was "an indicator of the compulsive behavior" that ruled him at the time.
Controversy involving Haggard first erupted in November 2006, when a former prostitute, Mike Jones, said the pastor had paid him for sex over three years and had used methamphetamine in his presence.
In a settlement with New Life, the church and Haggard agreed that he would retain his six-figure salary for a year, leave the Colorado Springs area, receive counseling and not speak publicly about what had happened for one year, according to a church staff member with knowledge of the settlement but who was not authorized to speak on the record.
I'm very grateful to him," Haggard said.
"Many of the charges against me are exaggerated, but it doesn't matter," Haggard told Larry King.
But at the same time, I had these other things going on."
Haggard said that, for a time, he lost the ability to read the Scriptures and became suicidal.
Haggard said he has, at least, another year of therapy ahead of him.
"I really do love this man," she told CNN when asked why she did not leave.
"I knew that Ted had some struggles in this area, particularly in his thoughts.
"He had lived so long on a pedestal," Marcus Haggard said about his famous father.
Asked if he wants to return to the pulpit, Haggard said, "I think Gail and I both want to tell our story to the degree that it's helpful to other people.
