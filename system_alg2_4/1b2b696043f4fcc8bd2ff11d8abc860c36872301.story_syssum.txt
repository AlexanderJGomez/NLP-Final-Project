(CNN) -- With Tuesday's recall vote, taxpayers in Wisconsin affirmed Gov.
This is, after all, Wisconsin -- the birthplace of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees and the first state to permit collective bargaining.
Walker took office in 2011 facing a $3.6 billion budget hole.
Before Walker's reforms, Wisconsin state employees enjoyed salary and benefits that were about 28% higher than comparable private sector workers, according to a new study from the American Enterprise Institute.
Democratic state senators fled to Illinois to avoid votes; up to 100,000 protesters stormed the state Capitol in Madison, climbing through windows and trashing the building; teachers handed out fake doctors' notes to skip school and protest, some even bringing their students with them; signs and fliers compared Scott Walker to Adolf Hitler; a Democratic state senator cursed out a Republican lawmaker; and lastly, Democrats initiated recall elections on state senators, the lieutenant governor and Walker.
Property taxes fell for the first time in 13 years, and Walker cited figures that showed Wisconsin has added 35,000 jobs since he took office.
With mandatory union dues now extinct, union membership has withered in Wisconsin.
In February 2011, President Obama called Walker's proposals an "assault" on unions.
On the other hand, the untold story of the Wisconsin saga may be the resurgence of the tea party.
On, Wisconsin!
On, Wisconsin!
