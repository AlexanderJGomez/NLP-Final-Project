1 Rory McIlroy reiterated his support for 2012 vice captain Paul McGinley on the day he announced a new multi-year sponsorship deal with Nike.
McGinley, a three-time Ryder Cup winner as a player, captained McIlroy at the Seve Trophy in 2009, when Great Britain and Ireland played against Continental Europe.
"If we go to Gleneagles and lose, he's already a winning Ryder Cup captain.
It had seemed to be a straight battle between 2011 British Open champion Darren Clarke, and Irish compatriot McGinley, who both served as vice captains to Jose Maria Olazabal in Chicago.
It would be fantastic to have Paul McGinley as the 2014 captain."
The announcement will be made after a 15-man committee that includes Montgomerie, Clarke and McGinley meets to decide.
