LONDON, England (CNN) -- Playing the Nintendo Wii Fit could improve balance and help avoid falls in seniors, researchers taking part in a new study suggest.
It is hoped that using the Wii Fit's balance board can improve elderly people's balance and confidence.
She told CNN: "There exists a medical fitness device that improves balance, but it is expensive and I could not get the funding.
Associate Professor Rick van der Zwan who led the research said initial results were "positive."
They ultimately hope to determine the effectiveness of computer games in developing muscle strength and co-ordination and reducing the risk of falls for people with Parkinson's.
Van der Zwan now wants to recruit 15 more research participants to broaden the study.
Todd believes the device's entertainment value not only improves residents' fitness levels, but also their mental fitness.
Her bowling partner Fisher told CNN he recently played the boxing game on Wii Fit with his four-year-old great-grandson.
