But while she battles for the gold, Johnson is fighting another battle: with Crohn's disease, one of the two most common inflammatory bowel diseases, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
About seven of every 100,000 people in the United States are diagnosed, most of them between the ages of 15 and 30, according to the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America.
Crohn's disease is an autoimmune disease of the digestive tract that most often affects the small or large intestines, and sometimes both.
In Crohn's disease, all layers of the intestine may be involved and there can be normal healthy bowel between patches of diseased bowel."
"Crohn's is a chronic, lifelong disease for which there is no cure," he said.
"For some, treatment will bring about favorable results.
Unknown triggers can also be caused by the environment.
A diagnosis of Crohn's disease often brings more questions than answers, and patients can face a long list of ever-changing complications.
The disease itself is not classified as a terminal illness, but the complications that arise from it can sometimes be life-threatening.
The two most common surgeries for Crohn's disease are bowel resection surgery, which involves removal of the deteriorated portion of intestine, and fistula repair surgery.
This is one of the most serious complications of Crohn's.
"It's not a matter of if we find cures; it's a matter of when, and that's determined by available funding," said Richard Geswell, president of the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America.
This allows the patient to develop an understanding of his or her individual case, and allows the foundation to have access to more patient histories for use in its research.
