I know I don't go there.
I don't care if a man sees a woman bald at the office on Wednesday, with blond finger waves at the club on Friday, and with jet black hair down to her butt at church on Sunday -- if anyone asks if she wears a weave, the answer is "I don't know."
And every man I know harbors that same level of sexism/wisdom/fear.
Which is why I had to talk to Blaine Stewart, who was not only brave and/or stupid enough to bring up his co-worker's weave -- he did it right in front of her face.
Right now you're probably thinking: Oh no he didn't.
"I knew the first rule about not talking about fat, but I didn't know the second," he said.
You sneeze in your hand and go to the bathroom and pray that an aunt, a cousin, someone has told her by the time you get out.
Stewart, who is bald, said the two actually talk about weaves on the show quite a bit, something he attributes to his latent hair envy.
But Muhammad said while she was comfortable with Stewart and others knowing, she was shocked "he put all of my business out there like that."
...
"I was a little surprised by some of the pretty harsh things people said about me," Stewart said.
That's when I stepped in and reminded Stewart that while "weave-gate" was bad, hair is not the last taboo.
I know the rules.
