"You are going to be on national news," Witherspoon allegedly told a Georgia state trooper as he handcuffed her on Atlanta's Peachtree Road early Friday morning.
The judge set May 22 as the date for a hearing to check if she is complying with the program.
"Mrs. Witherspoon began to hang out the window and say that she did not believe that I was a real police officer," Pyland wrote.
When the trooper warned her again, Witherspoon allegedly told him she was a U.S. citizen and allowed to "stand on American ground."
"I put my hands on Mrs. Witherspoon's arms to arrest her," Pyland wrote.
"You're about to find out who I am," she replied, the arrest report said.
Their car was impounded, and Witherspoon and Toth were taken to the Atlanta city jail, the report said.
A court date is set for Monday morning.
Witherspoon, whose earlier films include "Legally Blonde" and "Sweet Home Alabama," won a shelf full of awards for her performance as June Carter Cash in "Walk the Line," including a best actress Academy Award.
