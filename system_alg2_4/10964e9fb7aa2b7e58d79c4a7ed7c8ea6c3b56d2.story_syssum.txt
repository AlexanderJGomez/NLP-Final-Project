MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- The United States is "absolutely not" giving Israel a green light to attack Iran, U.S. President Barack Obama told CNN Tuesday.
Obama said Tuesday that Biden had simply been stating a fact, not sending a signal.
"The Israelis see Iran achieving a nuclear capability as an existential threat, and that fact is tied to the rhetoric of the leadership of Iran, which ... has said that they would seek to eliminate Israel," said Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
"I am hopeful that that dialogue is productive.
The State Department took a similar line on Monday.
The Israeli government considers Iran's nuclear program to be the dominant threat facing the country.
