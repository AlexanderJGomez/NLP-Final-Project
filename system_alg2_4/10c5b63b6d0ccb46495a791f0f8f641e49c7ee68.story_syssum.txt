"Sometimes I just get sick of myself," he confided, alluding to his time away from the spotlight.
But the deluge of media attention is starting to happen all over again.
Interview requests are pouring in.
For me, I was like, 'I don't want to love this too much, because what if this goes away?'
Maxwell: I didn't know.
I didn't know what people would want of me, if they wanted me back at all.
It's all cyclical.
Maxwell: I don't think so.
That is what I would love to have with the public -- is to be able to kind of go away and to come back, and it's as if no time had passed between us.
Maxwell: I feel like there's a healthy separation, and I think that it really helps me to have something to say and to not make a spectacle of my day-to-day.
I love people like Harrison Ford.
And then when it's time to get on stage, it's that other person that kind of comes into the formation.
CNN: Sounds like kind of a "Sasha Fierce" mentality, where you have your alter ego.
I might do something else.
CNN: But the new haircut kind of signified a new Maxwell.
If you're frozen in a time capsule, that's something you should be worried about.
For me, it's about transformation.
