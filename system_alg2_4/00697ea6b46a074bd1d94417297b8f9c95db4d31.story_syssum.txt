Actor Russell Johnson, best known as Professor in the 1960s TV sitcom "Gilligan's Island," died Thursday, his agent said.
Johnson worked up until his death, signing autographs over the holidays, said Eisenstadt.
Johnson was "just a positive and nice guy" who always treated people with respect, his agent said.
Before becoming an actor, Johnson served in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II.
"He will always be in our hearts and remembered from Gilligan's island as part of American pop culture history.
"Most of us have to really learn how to do what we do, and that takes some studying and being part of an acting group," he said.
