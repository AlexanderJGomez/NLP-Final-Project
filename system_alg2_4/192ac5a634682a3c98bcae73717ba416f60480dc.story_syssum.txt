Players control Pit with the device's circle pad and use its stylus to aim and turn him.
Fortunately, the game comes packed with a nifty stand, because trying to hold and maneuver gameplay was quite the contortion.
On the ground (because apparently this angel has a limit on how much he can fly), Pit navigates through a series of rooms and pathways, defeating enemies and collecting hearts.
Hearts are the currency by which players can obtain new weapons and skills.
If you want more, you bet hearts that you can complete the chapter, winning you more hearts.
Pit has nine weapon types at his disposal and can equip one before each chapter.
If there is a downside to the game, it is the dialogue.
Overall, "Kid Icarus: Uprising" does offer some solid combat, some great visuals and a good soundtrack.
"Kid Icarus: Uprising" is available now and only for the Nintendo 3DS.
