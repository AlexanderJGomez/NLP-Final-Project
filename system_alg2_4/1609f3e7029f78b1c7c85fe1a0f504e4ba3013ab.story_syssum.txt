His family said he was arrested in August while visiting his grandmother and other relatives in Iran and that his statement had to have been coerced.
"I really like him," said Condon, who identified Hekmati from the images released by Iranian state television.
The work, funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, was aimed at improving communications between U.S. troops and local populations -- a problem with which Hekmati had grappled during service with the Marines in Iraq.
"We are deeply concerned that Amir is not receiving a fair trial and has not been afforded due process," said a family statement released last week.
The family said their son was being represented by a government-appointment lawyer.
His four-year hitch included an assignment with the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California, and a six-month deployment in Iraq in 2004, according to U.S. military records.
And Condon said Hekmati recently worked for a company that produced language-training material for the U.S. military.
Iran claims to have arrested a dozen CIA spies and there have been U.S. allegations that Iran sought to kill Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States.
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said last month Hekmati is being falsely accused, but had no further comment.
"You feel so helpless, because it seems like there's nothing you can do."
