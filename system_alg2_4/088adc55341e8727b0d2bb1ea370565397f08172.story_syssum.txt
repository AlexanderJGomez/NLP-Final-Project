At least 194 people were killed and 248 injured after torrential rains in Colombia that have affected nearly 1.6 million people, according to the country's interior ministry.
As of Monday night, they had found 23 bodies, Nova said, and more than 120 others could still be trapped underground.
"They haven't been able to get them out."
"From this tragedy that has no precedent in the history of our country, we are going to forge ahead," Santos said Sunday after flying over some of the most severely affected areas, according to a statement on the government's website.
