Why would they do that?
Although it is extremely distressing that children engage in these types of behavior, I don't find it surprising it all.
First, I am surprised that, before this study, most people assumed that children wouldn't engage in a behavior that is so common in teenagers and young adults.
Anyone who has children knows that they are subject to the same powerful emotions as adults.
After all, children are subject to extremely powerful emotions and have a tremendous capacity for fear and worry.
The final thing about non-suicidal self-injury that surprises me is that it occurs at all.
But why do so many people hurt themselves not because they want to die but because they want to hurt themselves?
This is more often the case with women and usually involves cutting the skin, although I've treated patients over the years who were addicted to other types of self-damaging behavior, such as hitting themselves in the face or inserting sharp objects into various bodily orifices.
You'd think that people who recurrently injured themselves would be at increased risk of committing suicide, but this is far from clear.
Most non-suicidal self-injury occurs in adolescent and young adult females and drops off sharply in prevalence with advancing age.
Young adult females make 25 suicide attempts for every one completed suicide.
Although the last thing psychiatry needs in general is another diagnostic category, the upside of this proposal is that it makes official something many patients have been trying to tell us for years: that their apparent suicidal behavior is not really motivated by an urge to kill themselves.
