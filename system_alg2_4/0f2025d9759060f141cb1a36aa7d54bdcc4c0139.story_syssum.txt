The blast in Afghanistan's Takhar province killed Kunduz provincial governor Mohammad Omar, who recently sounded an alarm about the threat of insurgents during an interview with CNN.
Faiz Mohammad Powhidi, a Takhar governor spokesman, told CNN that a pre-placed mine exploded.
He told CNN on Sunday that for the last two years, the security situation has deteriorated in Kunduz because insurgents decided to destabilize northern Afghanistan, which, until recently, had been relatively stable during the nine-year-old Afghan conflict.
"Currently 40 percent of Kunduz province is under Taliban control," he said.
"Today the news reaches us of another attack in which the governor of Kunduz, Mohammad Omar, was killed.
NATO does not give the nationalities of service members who are killed, but the British Defence Ministry said one of its soldiers was killed in Helmand province in the south Friday.
