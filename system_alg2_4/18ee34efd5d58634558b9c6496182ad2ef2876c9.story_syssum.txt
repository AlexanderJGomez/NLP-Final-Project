One-third of the obese participants and 55% of overweight participants had never been told by a doctor that they were overweight, the study found.
Nearly 20% of obese people whose doctors hadn't brought up their weight described themselves as "not overweight," compared with just 3% of those whose doctors had addressed their weight.
Doctors may be reluctant to broach the subject of weight for a number of reasons, Post says.
Roughly two-thirds of U.S. adults are now overweight or obese, and as Americans have grown heavier, the perception of what constitutes a normal weight has changed as well, Post says.
Although it might seem obvious that excess weight is unhealthy, being reminded of this by a doctor can be an effective wake-up call, says Robert B. Baron, M.D., director of the weight management program at the University of California San Francisco.
Simple reminders and encouragement to lose weight could have a similar effect on overweight and obese patients, he says.
"If it were required or strongly suggested, it would not be very onerous.... We need to be as aggressive as we were with smoking cessation."
