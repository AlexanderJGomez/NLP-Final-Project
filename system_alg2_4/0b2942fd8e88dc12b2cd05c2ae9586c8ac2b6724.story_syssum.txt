(CNN) -- House Speaker John Boehner's threatened lawsuit against President Obama has elicited scorn from the right and blistering attacks from the left.
And I say this as a guy who has perpetrated some serious stunt work in my political career.
So, perhaps to appease the tea party bosses, Boehner has decided to sue the President.
As the progressive group Americans United for Change notes in this clever ad, Boehner has long opposed citizens' rights to sue corporations over, say, defective products or gender discrimination in the workplace.
Now, here's the depressing part: Boehner's sue first, ask questions later strategy just might work.
Soon, I expect them to grant sainthood to Koch Industries.
Perhaps his lawsuit is just one strand of a handful of spaghetti he's throwing against the wall just to get through the day and survive the latest tea party onslaught.
Perhaps realizing that shifting demographics and a divided GOP will make it difficult to put a Republican back in the White House, they may seize on Boehner's lawsuit and use it to further crimp the power of the chief executive.
