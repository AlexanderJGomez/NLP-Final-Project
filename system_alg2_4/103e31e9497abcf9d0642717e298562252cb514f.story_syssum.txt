His death comes at an awkward time for President Raul Castro's government: another prisoner died after going on a hunger strike earlier this month, and Pope Benedict is due to visit Cuba in the coming months.
Villar Mendoza started his hunger strike following his sentencing, halting it briefly in December when the authorities said they would listen to his demand for his case to be reconsidered, Sanchez said.
Cobas called the pardons "exclusive and limited," Sanchez said.
With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking would not be released.
