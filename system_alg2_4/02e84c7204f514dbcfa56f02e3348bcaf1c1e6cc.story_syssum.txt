Los Angeles (CNN) -- Delays in deposing Kanye West and other witnesses in the divorce of Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries mean the 72-day marriage may not legally end until next year, lawyers said at a hearing Wednesday.
"Ms. Kardashian had no intention of going through with the marriage," Waller said.
Kardashian lawyer Laura Wasser asked in court Wednesday.
The deposition of Kardashian will not happen until after Humphries' lawyers have reviewed the production documents, Waller said.
Kanye West, Kardashian's current boyfriend, could be a key witness in the divorce trial, but the hip-hop star has so far evaded Humphries' efforts to subpoena him for a deposition, Waller said.
West was not there at the time, Kardashian lawyer Laura Wasser said.
Humphries' girlfriend will be deposed by Kardashian's lawyers in New York Tuesday, Wasser said.
