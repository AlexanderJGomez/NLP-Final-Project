One young entrepreneur, Mansukhbhai Prajapati, lost everything, but found an innovative way to get back on his feet.
Prajapati's invention is part of a growing trend in India that has become known as "frugal innovation" -- below-the-radar inventors across the country devising low-cost solutions to local problems, often borne of necessity, using bespoke technologies of their own creation.
By his own reckoning, Gupta believes that the Honey Bee Network has helped unearth over 25,000 new inventions, including a motorbike-mounted crop sprayer, a device for climbing trees, an amphibious bicycle and a wind-powered irrigation system.
Kirsten Bound, the author of Nesta's report, says "frugal innovation is all about creating advantage out of constraint.
In a bid to reduce the work involved, Patel invented a cotton-stripping machine that can be operated by one person.
The projects the organization has run in conjunction with Indian inventors have already yielded products that are being used around India today, including a classroom projector fashioned from repurposed cell phone components and a low-cost health screening tool made from an old alarm clock.
"Frugal innovation coming out of India could have important implications for the rest of the world" says Bound.
The rising waters in the village of Jatwa-Janerwa made it impossible for many people to work, shop or go about their daily lives.
It looked like a regular bike, but had large retractable floats attached to the sides of each wheel.
Gupta says there is work to be done yet in connecting creative people with funding, and not all of it can come from the public purse.
