The Northeast will begin cooling slightly Friday, the service said, but the heat is expected to continue with forecasts in the low 90s and high 80s across the mid-Atlantic states.
"[More than 400] cooling centers will continue to remain open Friday," said New York Emergency management spokeswoman Judith Kane.
According to the National Weather Service, Baltimore and Washington reached high temperatures of 98 degrees on Thursday.
Farther north, Boston, New York and Philadelphia reached, respectively, 95, 93 and 97 degrees, the service said.
In the past decade, heat has been the second-leading cause for weather-related fatalities, the service said.
