The December gang-rape and murder of a young woman in New Delhi has stirred consciences in India in a way I have never before experienced: It has forced Indians to confront a terrible truth that for our girls and women, violence and discrimination are facts of daily life, an epidemic that, researchers say, claims nearly 2 million lives in India each year.
For more than a decade I've worked for the poverty-fighting group CARE as a community educator on health and gender issues.
But along the way, I've also met countless men who, given an opportunity, were willing to examine and improve their behavior towards the girls and women in their lives.
When prompted to reflect on their attitudes towards women's education, sharing domestic tasks, having girl children, and even violence, the boys and men I work with every day can and do change.
He understood that men and boys are under pressure to express power and that when they feel weak or frustrated, their gut reaction is often to demonstrate power, even if that means violent or abusive behavior.
And so I kept thinking of Ram as I gathered with the group of 53 principals from boys and girls schools earlier this month.
Only when the educators were forced to hold a mirror up to their own lives did it feel like we were playing offense, too.
One principal realized he'd never even considered doing household chores, not as a boy or, now, as a husband and a father.
A World Health Organization global survey found that 59% of women in rural Ethiopia report being subjected to sexual violence from their intimate partner, 62% of women in Peru report physical violence at the hands of their partners and 30% of women in rural Bangladesh say their first sexual experience was forced.
Even so, I'm confident that the Indian people can demonstrate to the world that we're not powerless in the face of some global epidemic.
