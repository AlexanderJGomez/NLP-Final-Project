According to Morrissey, he's had a cancer scare, although in talking about the disease, the singer doesn't seem that scared at all.
And if I don't, then I don't.
In early 2013, Morrissey spent some time in a Michigan hospital after suffering from "a concussion, a bleeding ulcer and Barrett's esophagus."
After canceling six U.S. shows following his hospital stay, the singer penned a grim letter to fans where he discussed his own mortality.
In a recent interview where Morrissey talked about his many health issues, he proclaimed that, "The worst was in June in Boston, when I was hospitalized with acute fever.
I've never been so frightened in my life.
At press time, Morrissey hasn't updated his fan sites about the cancer reports.
