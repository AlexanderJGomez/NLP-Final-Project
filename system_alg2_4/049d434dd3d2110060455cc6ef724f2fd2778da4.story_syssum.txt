(CNN)Well, the Senate says climate change isn't a hoax.
At least, in a 98-to-1 vote, they said, in public, that climate change is not a hoax.
Americans -- 61% of whom say climate change is real and 40% of whom know it's caused by people, according to to a 2014 Pew survey -- have a right to know where their elected officials fall on this and many other important policy issues.
We learned that 98 senators say climate change is happening -- without blaming humans for it.
We also know that 49 senators voted against the amendment saying climate change is, in fact, caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases.
(The amendment said "human activity significantly contributes" to the warming climate.)
The right, as Elana Schor of Politico smartly noted, played this brilliantly, appearing to take a the-Earth's-not-flat stance on this, while actually ceding next-to-nothing.
Congress should debate how to respond to climate change, not its very existence.
And Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, a young mom from the Marshall Islands, in the Pacific, whose nation may be sunk by rising sea levels.
Listen to the science.
And skip the rest.
