Robert Lewandowski, the Poland striker, was already one of the most feared forwards in European football before his took the field.
He left with his reputation enhanced four-fold, his asking price at an all-time high and his team within touching distance of next month's Champions League final.
"The first 25 minutes were great and then we lost a bit of our game.
Go back to the strong first 25 minutes'."
If Bayern's 4-0 win over Barcelona on Tuesday night was supposedly the beginning of a power shift from Spain to Germany, then Dortmund's dominance confirmed it.
Lewandowski led the line, a lone warrior refusing to be tamed by a Real defense appearing more and more desperate as the night progressed.
Just seven minutes had elapsed when the wonderfully talented Reus danced his way through the Real defense, before unleashing a rasping effort which was parried away by Diego Lopez.
But while Dortmund dominated, it was unable to add to its advantage and was made to pay as Real struck back with just two minutes of the half remaining.
But whatever Klopp said to his side at the break worked a treat as they produced one of the most enthralling second half displays in recent times.
That fourth goal was not far away, however, and when Xavi Alonso fouled Reus inside the penalty area, Lewandowski stood up to power home from 12-yards.
On that occasion, Deportivo La Coruna came back from a 4-1 defeat at AC Milan to win 5-4 on aggregate courtesy of a 4-0 home win.
"I think Dortmund were the best team by far," Real boss Mourinho told Sky Sports.
"We know everything about Robert Lewandowski, every detail possible and we lost him in three goals.
A 3-0 win would take Real through to the final and keep alive its hopes of winning "La Decima" -- the club's tenth trophy in the competition.
They are a great side."
