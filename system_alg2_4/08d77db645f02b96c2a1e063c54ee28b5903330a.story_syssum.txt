(CNN) -- Attorneys for a Guantanamo Bay detainee on a hunger strike say a U.S. military nurse has refused to conduct forced feedings of inmates.
"He explained to us: 'Before we came here, we were told a different story.
The matter is in the hands of the individual's leadership.
Dhiab is part of a group of detainees who are participating in a hunger strike to protest their continued, open-end detention without charges being filed, said Crider, who works at the London-based legal defense group Reprieve.
Crider said it was believed to be the first time one of the U.S. medical personnel has refused to carry out the feeding regimen.
Supporters of Dhiab say he is among more than 40 men who at one time in the past few years were being forced fed.
His supporters deny he is a terrorist and say the Syrian had been operating a food import business in Kabul, Afghanistan before the 9/11 terror attacks.
"The court is in no position to make the complex medical decisions necessary to keep Mr. Dhiab alive," said Judge Gladys Kessler.
Kessler also ordered the Obama administration to release 34 video recordings of Dhiab being forced-fed, as well as the detainee's medical records.
