Chrisette Michele's album "Epiphany" debuted at No.
"I always eat grapes before I go on."
But this isn't Michele's first big career moment: She won a Grammy this year in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance category for her single, "Be OK," featuring will.i.am.
Michele: I have epiphanies all the time, because I'm always thinking.
And the reason why it was an epiphany was when I first started, I was so afraid that maybe they won't like me.
CNN: Tell me about the single.
I'm sick and tired of waiting for him to come home."
And that's her epiphany.
Ego smashed!
Michele: Ella Fitzgerald.
I get excited when we talk about jazz.
Michele: I'm an advocate of music in schools.
Michele: When I was in school I used to prank my teachers all the time.
And even in those pranks, the teachers would laugh most of the time.
I also love Adele's new album.
Those are two that are on my radar.
