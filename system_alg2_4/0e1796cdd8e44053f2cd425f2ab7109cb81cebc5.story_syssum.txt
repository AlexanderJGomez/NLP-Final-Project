Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- Moments after returning from visiting Rep. Gabrielle Giffords at the hospital, the congresswoman's six-time campaign chairman said Sunday that he is confident that she will survive, though the extent of her recovery remained unclear.
The rallies were organized by members of the Tea Party around Giffords' support for President Barack Obama's health care bill, he said.
He added, "That's where the Tea Party, I think, went over the edge.
"Spirited debate is desirable in our country, but it only should be the clash of ideas.
"If you look at the demographics, you would not think that she could get elected," he said.
