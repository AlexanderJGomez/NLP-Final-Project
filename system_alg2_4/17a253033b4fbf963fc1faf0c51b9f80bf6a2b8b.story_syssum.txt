(CNN) -- California's Supreme Court on Tuesday denied the San Diego County clerk's request to immediately halt same-sex marriages in the state, the latest, if not necessarily last, key ruling in a years-long legal fight.
In a lengthy court document filed last Friday with California's Supreme Court, San Diego County Clerk Ernest Dronenburg asked the court to order Gov.
"Your religion, I respect it, I don't agree with it," LGBT rights activist Sean Sala said.
The clerk said he wanted California's Supreme Court to halt same-sex marriages because of what had happened once before: such weddings took place only to be later ruled to be against state law.
A federal appeals court subsequently ruled that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional, though it still issued a stay on same-sex marriages until the U.S. Supreme Court could weigh in.
In a tweet several days ago, for instance, the American Family Association's Bryan Fischer compared the county clerk to civil rights icon Rosa Parks for refusing "to violate CA constitution on wedding licenses."
"It's not over!"
"California Supreme Court still has to has to hear petitions to halt same-gender marriage in August."
