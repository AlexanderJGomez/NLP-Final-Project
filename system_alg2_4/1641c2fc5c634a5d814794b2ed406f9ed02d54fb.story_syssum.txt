Georgian soldiers on a tank watch a Russian attack on a convoy outside Gori on Monday.
About 26,000 are in the Georgian military, and about 17,000 of them are in the army, which has had the benefit of four years of training by the U.S. Marines, Army and Special Forces, according to Jane's.
Those forces would be using almost all Soviet-era weaponry.
The Georgian army has about 150 armored personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles and a similar number of artillery pieces.
Georgia has 150 surface-to-air missiles to use in the fight, according to Jane's.
It is not known how many or which of its forces are fighting in Georgia.
