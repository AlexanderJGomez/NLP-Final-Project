(CNN) -- The race is on to locate the latest Banksy on the streets of New York.
Banksy knows that his reputation was made on street corners, not in establishment hang-outs like the auction rooms of London and New York.
Banksy is painting images on walls, taking photographs and publishing them on Instagram and his own website.
The lingering question is: Will anyone locate Banksy himself and publish that picture on Instagram?
Apparently I've even met him without knowing it.
