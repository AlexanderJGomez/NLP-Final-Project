Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Two explosions rocked an anti-government protest in the Thai capital of Bangkok on Friday, wounding more than two dozen people, security and health officials said.
Roughly 12,000 protesters were on the streets Friday, Paradon said.
Akanat Prompan, a spokesman for the main protest group, said the blasts Friday were the first attack on marches in daylight on a public street.
The protests this week caused some disruption in central Bangkok, but large areas of the sprawling capital city remain unaffected.
Since demonstrations against Yingluck's government began in November, eight people have died and more than 450 have been wounded, according to authorities.
The opposition Democrat Party has said it will boycott the elections.
Protest leaders have said they want to rid Thailand of the influence of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the older brother of Yingluck.
Opposition to Thaksin and Yingluck is strongest among the urban elites and middle class, particularly in Bangkok.
His supporters, known as "red shirts," support the holding of elections on February 2.
