The three injured students have been released from hospitals, the sheriff's office said.
Harris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia said earlier that "there has been some information that this may have been gang-related," but he stressed that no conclusions had been reached because the investigation was in the early stages.
After the stabbings, students were kept in classrooms for safety and to allow authorities to interview witnesses, said the superintendent of Spring Independent School District, Ralph Draper.
He said it was pretty scary at first when they were rushing everyone into the classrooms," Dauth said.
The district gave automated phone and e-mail messages to parents about three hours after the stabbings, she said.
