This music even has the ability to make us like our old Aunt Emily.
Then there's a good Christmas story.
Then there's one that the marketers made sure really goes for the heart -- "I'll Be Home for Christmas" -- and the line, "if only in my dreams."
Speaking of hits, there's "White Christmas" -- more than 500 different recordings were made of this song; which was originally written for the movie "Holiday Inn."
Next up are the seasonal songs that really have little or nothing to do with the holiday.
Let it Snow!
(This song of trying to entice a young lady to stay was written for the film "Neptune's Daughter," with Esther Williams and Ricardo Montalban.)
Of course, Christmas is children.
Somebody please explain why anybody would buy that song.
So here's the question: What is this all about?
I realized a while ago that indeed we all need a little Christmas.
Wouldn't it have been nice if those marketing guys figured out a way to make those 12 days of Christmas last for the other 353 days of the year?
So deck the halls and please stop leaving Santa those fattening chocolate chip cookies -- he's gained a lot of weight during the past 200-plus years.
