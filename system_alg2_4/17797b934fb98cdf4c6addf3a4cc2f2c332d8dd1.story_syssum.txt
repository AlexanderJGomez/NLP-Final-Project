The hearing began without Casey Anthony, as defense attorney Jose Baez saying she waived her right to appear.
Orange County Circuit Judge Stan Strickland agreed, sending deputies to retrieve Anthony from jail but starting the hearing without her.
Anthony, 22, is accused of killing her 2-year-old daughter Caylee, who was last reported seen in June.
In Thursday's hearing, prosecutors and defense attorneys wrangled over defense experts' access to images from the scene where the body was found.
Because the experts are outside the jurisdiction of the Florida court, Strickland would have little recourse if the photos wound up "displayed on some magazine at the checkout at the Publix," prosecutor Linda Drane Burdick said Thursday.
Checking out her story, authorities found that the apartment where Anthony said she left Caylee was vacant and located a Zenaida Gonzalez, who said she had never met Anthony.
Circuit Judge Jose Rodriguez agreed that Anthony should not be compelled to undergo an oral deposition, but said Morgan could depose her with written questions and answers.

Prosecutors have said they will not seek the death penalty against her.
