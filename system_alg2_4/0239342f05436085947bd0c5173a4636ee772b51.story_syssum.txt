WASHINGTON (CNN) -- State Department officials should serve where they are needed -- even in war-torn Iraq, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Friday.

"Thank you for that comment.
"Should others step forward, as some already have, we will fill these new jobs as we have before -- with volunteers.
Fifteen people have stepped forward to volunteer for Iraq service since the new policy was announced October 26, department spokesman Sean McCormack said.
McCormack said until now the State Department has been successful in filling jobs in Iraq with volunteers.
State Department employees have been killed in Iraq, but McCormack could not say how many.
