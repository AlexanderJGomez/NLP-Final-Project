Sean Penn plays San Francisco City Supervisor Harvey Milk in "Milk," directed by Gus Van Sant.
An audiotape Milk records "just in case" is screenwriter Dustin Lance Black's convenient structuring device, foregrounding the story's tragic outcome and allowing Milk to narrate his own life story.
Civic elections might seem like small beer, but the persecution that compelled Milk to run for office is no trivial matter.
Ironically, the devoutly "normal" White is the one who is truly messed up.
(She may not know it, but Anita Bryant has a co-starring role in this movie.)
It's easy to see how he attracts so much support -- and how his drive and commitment don't leave enough time for a "real" life.
"Milk" may be a little too homogenized for some tastes.
In that respect, it evokes the best aspirations of the country -- and, for that matter, of filmmaking.
