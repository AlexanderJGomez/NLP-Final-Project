But while Abbas's raising of the document during his speech drew applause at the General Assembly, the United States has already promised it will veto the Palestinian statehood bid at a Security Council meeting Monday.
With that deadline not having been met Palestinian leaders argue that that the best way to enhance the chances for peace moving forward is for international recognition of a Palestinian state.
Both the U.S. and Israel consider the Palestinian strategy a unilateral move that will only hinder the possibility of reaching a peaceful settlement to the Middle East conflict.
Without the acknowledgement of Israel and the U.S., United Nations recognition of a Palestinian state based on armistice lines that existed before 1967 is largely a symbolic move.
Many believe recognition of a Palestinian state would exacerbate already poor relations between the Palestinian Authority government and Israel.
Palestinian Authority leadership maintains that recognition would help put pressure on Israel to be more reasonable in future negotiations.
The Palestinian Authority could also risk losing support from its own people.
Currently there are no talks going on between Israeli and Palestinians.
In an effort to head off the Palestinian's statehood request at the U.N. the United States and various European countries have been engaged in 11th hour diplomacy to get the talks restarted but few expect a breakthrough deal.
