This 60-foot sailboat, the Plastiki, is being built from more than 12,000 recycled plastic bottles.
De Rothschild hopes his one-of-a-kind vessel, now being built on a San Francisco pier, will boost recycling of plastic bottles, which he says are a symbol of global waste.
Everything will be recycled.
In 2005 he founded Adventure Ecology, an organization that uses field expeditions to call attention to environmental issues.
The Plastiki is expected to stop in Hawaii, Tuvalu and Fiji on its way to Sydney, a trip estimated to take more than 100 days.
"This actually is the same material that is made out of bottles," said de Rothschild of the PET fabric.
Only about 10 percent of the Plastiki will be made from new materials, de Rothschild said.
"We could potentially put together a boat that costs a fraction of what normal conventional boats are made of," he said.
It's infinitely recyclable."
"But it strikes me as a long way to go.
This trip strikes me as kind of dangerous."
