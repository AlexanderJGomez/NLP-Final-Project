Nonetheless, the 20-year-old from the St. Louis area has been arrested for the shootings of two police officers during last week's protests in Ferguson, Missouri, a prosecutor said Sunday.
"I asked him why would he say that he was a protester because it makes us look bad -- because so many things that we've done to rebuild our community," Robinson said.
The prosecutor thanked the public for the information that led to the arrest.
One element of the case that authorities have yet to sort out is intent, McCulloch said, adding that Williams has acknowledged firing the shots but has said he wasn't aiming at the police officers.
The shots rang out from a hill overlooking the city's police station shortly after midnight Wednesday, at the end of a protest against the Ferguson Police Department, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at the time.
McCulloch said the tipster whose information led to Williams' arrest is eligible to receive the reward.
"These police officers were standing there, and they were shot just because they were police officers," he said.
"We are actively addressing the issues that have raised concerns of fairness and fair treatment.
While many protesters have decried the Ferguson Police Department, neither of the officers shot last week were from the city.
He is a 41-year-old officer with the St. Louis County Police Department, who has been in law enforcement for 14 years.
