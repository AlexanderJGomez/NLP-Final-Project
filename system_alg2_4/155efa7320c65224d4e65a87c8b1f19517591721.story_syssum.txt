As an independent myself, I usually cheer the prospect of any independent campaign.
It's a shame because in his purely CEO persona, Trump could have mounted a semi-credible independent campaign.
In other words, they are fiscally conservative but socially liberal.
It's perhaps useful to remember that Perot campaigned primarily on reducing the deficit and the debt at a time when America was struggling to get out of a recession and many people thought that Japan was a rising power that would eclipse the United States.
But instead, Trump has done a 180-degree reversal on abortion (like Mitt Romney before him) in the hopes of winning the GOP nomination, because abortion-rights Republicans have become an endangered species despite the endurance of "individual freedom" rhetoric.
But it will hurt both Trump and the GOP in the long run, while nuking any hope he had of appealing to independent voters.
If Trump were to try and run as an independent, he could still win enough votes to poll in the low single digits of the popular vote, as Pat Buchanan did before him.
Trump would not.
Independent voters are now the largest and fastest-growing segment of the electorate.
