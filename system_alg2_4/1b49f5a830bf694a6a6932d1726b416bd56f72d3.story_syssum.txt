London, England (CNN) -- Whether in the form of personal history or political biography, Jung Chang has spent her writerly life telling the story of China's tumultuous recent past.
She served briefly as a Red Guard and worked a variety of odd jobs in the countryside before turning to studying English.
CNN caught up with Chang, who currently lives in London, and asked her about China and why it's so important to remember the past.
"Wild Swans" is the story of my family -- my grandmother, my mother and myself.
CNN: Your books are banned in China.
How does that make you feel?
But my books are published in Hong Kong.
JC: I think particularly in the initial years what stuck me most was the dramatic diminishment of fear.
Mao held the country back.
Of course, having said all that, there are still many things that frustrate me.
JC: If there isn't anything dramatic happening, I think the country will probably go on as it is for a very long time.
I hope, of course, for the obvious and the best -- I want people to enjoy the kind of freedom they do in Britain for example.
I guess I miss the whole place, the people who have been through so much and the country, which is so old and yet so young and energetic.
All these things make tears come to my eyes.
