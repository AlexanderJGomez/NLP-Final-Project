Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was treated with blood thinners on Monday at a New York hospital to help dissolve a blood clot in her head and doctors were confident she would make a full recovery.
She is in good spirits, engaging with her doctors, her family, and her staff," Clinton's doctors said.
Clots can form inside veins or arteries or even the heart, the NIH says.
Her illness forced her to bow out of testifying on December 20 before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the deadly September attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.
