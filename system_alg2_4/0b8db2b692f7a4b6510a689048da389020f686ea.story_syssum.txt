Hackers appear to have posted account info for 4.6 million users of quickie social-sharing app Snapchat, making usernames and at least partial phone numbers available for download.
Security matters as much as user experience does," the hackers said in a statement to technology blog TechCrunch.
In the statement, the hackers said they blurred the last two digits of the phone numbers they posted but were still considering whether to post more with the full number visible.
The SnapchatDB group said Snapchat implemented "very minor obstacles" after that.
"Happy Snapping!"
