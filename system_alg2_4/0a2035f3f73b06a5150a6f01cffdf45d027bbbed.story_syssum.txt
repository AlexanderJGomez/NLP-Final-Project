Paula Broadwell, a woman who was romantically involved with former CIA Director David Petraeus, will not face federal charges of cyberstalking another woman friendly with Petraeus.
Sources close to Kelley said she had not been romantically involved with Petraeus.
During the investigation the FBI obtained Broadwell's computer and discovered she had classified materials.
Sources close to Broadwell acknowledged that issue has not been resolved.
That matter was turned over to the Pentagon's inspector general for investigation.
