All were brought to you by introverts.
Our culture is biased against quiet and reserved people, but introverts are responsible for some of humanity's greatest achievements -- from Steve Wozniak's invention of the Apple computer to J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter.
That's one out of every two or three people you know.
Kids who prefer to work by themselves don't fit, and research by educational psychology professor Charles Meisgeier found that the majority of teachers believe the ideal student is an extrovert -- even though introverts tend to get higher grades, according to psychologist Adrian Furnham.
Many of us now work in offices without walls, with no respite from the noise and gaze of co-workers.
There's also a term, ambivert, for people who fall smack in the middle of the spectrum.
The need for balance is especially important when it comes to creativity and productivity.
Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer alone in his cubicle at Hewlett Packard.
Of course, this doesn't mean that we should stop collaborating with each other -- witness Wozniak teaming up with Steve Jobs to form Apple.
Our major religions all tell the story of seekers -- Moses, Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha -- who go off alone, to the wilderness, and bring profound revelations back to the community.
So it's much better to send people off to generate ideas by themselves, freed from the distortion of group dynamics, and only then come together as a team.
But I am saying that we all need alone time.
And that the more freedom we give introverts to be themselves, the more they'll dream up their own unique solutions to the problems that bedevil us.
