It still looks the same, but Sears Tower in Chicago, Illinois, will have a new name: Willis Tower.
More than 90,000 people have joined the group "People Against the Sears Tower Name Change," on the social networking Web site Facebook.
I believe the Illinois Congress needs to proclaim the Sears Tower a recognizable landmark that is known all over the world by people who have traveled to Chicago."
The skyscraper's Web site also features the new name.
That doesn't matter to those against the name change.
"That pretty much sums it up.
No one will start calling it the Willis Tower."
