(CNN)  -- In-form superstars Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi go head-to-head in Monday night's El Clasico between Real Madrid and Barcelona in the Camp Nou, which is set to have a significant bearing on the Spanish title race.
"We are stronger than last season and we go into the match without losing a match and have a lot more confidence and solidity.
"The Clasico is obviously an important match because we will play against a direct opponent," he told the official Real Madrid website.
My concentration won't falter if the stands are against me.
That's all," claimed Mourinho, who masterminded a Champions League semifinal victory over Barcelona as Inter Milan coach last season.
Ronaldo, who tops the La Liga scoring charts with 15, just ahead of Messi, claims the match is so much more than an individual battle between the pair.
"Real will come to Camp Nou with revenge in mind," Messi told AFP.
