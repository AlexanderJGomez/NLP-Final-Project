(CNN) -- U.S soccer star Robbie Rogers has "come out" as gay on the day he retired from the game Friday.
"I always thought I could hide this secret.
"I will always be thankful for my career.
It's time to discover myself away from football.
My secret is gone, I am a free man, I can move on and live my life as my creator intended."
Truth is not always easy to display, but truly strong people always find a way #RESPECT"
But not since the tragic loss of Justin Fashanu has a top-flight league witnessed an openly gay professional football player.
It's the nature of the business.
I know I'm there to be shot down in flames."
While other sports have embraced their gay stars, such as John Amaechi in basketball, Martina Navratilova in tennis and Gareth Thomas in rugby, football has yet to move with the times.
And while football has yet to move with the times, progress is being made.
"When a player gives a pass away or falls over, fans use homophobia abuse to put them down and it's that which we want to stop.

"Reading his blog, it felt as if he thought he had no choice but to quit football if he wanted come out.
