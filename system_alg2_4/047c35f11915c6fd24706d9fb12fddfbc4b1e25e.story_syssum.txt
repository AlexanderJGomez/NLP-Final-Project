Speaker Nancy Pelosi cited Colbert's "ability to bring attention to an important issue like immigration" in declaring the hearing appropriate.
Does anyone believe that the real problem with immigration is a lack of attention to the issue?
The real question is: What is Congress doing to fix it?
Although I have sponsored and co-sponsored more than a dozen bills and resolutions on immigration none has ever been given time before the subcommittee.
Instead, the Democrats brought in Colbert.
The entire fiasco only highlights the fact that during a time when Democrats control the House, the Senate and the presidency, the Subcommittee on Immigration has done virtually nothing.
Most of us on the subcommittee would agree that we need to fix legal immigration.
They deserve leadership in Congress that will take the issue of immigration seriously instead of turning it into a comedy bit.
