But she never gave up, and she continuously reminded herself to keep going.
Dumig met Sahra through a photo workshop at Refugio, a shelter in Munich, Germany, for refugees and torture victims.
One of the reasons Dumig decided to photograph Sahra is because growing up in Germany made Dumig realize that she lived a fortunate lifestyle.
"Apart Together" serves not only as a documentation of Sahra, but as a far-reaching story about people from all backgrounds.
"Every one of these (refugees) have strong stories, and in the bureaucratic system, they are just a number or a document," Dumig said.
Regardless of the challenges Sahra faces as a refugee in Germany, she is a survivor and the embodiment of resilience, determined to establish a new life for herself.
There is no certain and clear way in which to arrange the pieces, because they are a representation of the fragmented nature of Sahra's life.
That's up to the viewer," Dumig said.
"It was just something we both got something out of," Dumig said.
