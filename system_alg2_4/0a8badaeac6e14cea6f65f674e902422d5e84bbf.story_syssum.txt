"Walmart and the McNair family have worked closely together to reach an agreement.
Pamela McNair said the family will continue carrying on James' legacy as a humanitarian, and the finances from the settlement will help.

Tracy Morgan's lawyer told CNN in November that he was still recovering from the car accident that left him with a "severe brain injury" and is fighting to return to the person he once was.
