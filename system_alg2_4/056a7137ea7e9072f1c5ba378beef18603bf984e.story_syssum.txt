At least 11 suspected al Qaeda militants were killed in Yemen's southern province of Abyan in clashes that erupted Tuesday night and continued for at least 14 hours, according to officials and local residents.
Security officials in Abyan told CNN that at least 65 foreign fighters were killed in Abyan since May.
Before that, nearly all of the al Qaeda fighters here were Yemeni," added Abu Kareem.
Ansaar Sharia, an extremist militant group with links to al Qaeda, took over large areas in Abyan province last May after government forces evacuated hundreds of troops from their original posts.
More than 100,000 residents left the province months ago and are living in shelters in neighboring Aden and Lahj provinces.
