Residents of this sleepy Turkish border town breathed a sigh of relief on Thursday.
Fighting first erupted in the area on November 8, when Syrian rebels mounted an assault on Syrian government forces in the neighboring Syrian town of Ras Al Ain.
They raised the opposition flag triumphantly over Ras Al Ain, despite the fact that their offensive had sent thousands of terrified residents streaming across the border to Turkey for safety.
As Ras Al Ain shook and shuddered, Turkish soldiers and ambulances waited at the nearby border gate, collecting scores of Syrians who arrived wounded, and rushing them to nearby hospitals.
"Syria has been given a note of protest.
Whether or not Damascus heeded Ankara's warning is not clear.
An officer from the local Zabita, a municipal police force, said he was hosting 30 Syrian refugees in his home.
"From the beginning of the revolution, refugees came from all across Syria to Ras Al Ain because it was safe," said Rashid Mohammed, a Kurdish farmer who was living in the municipal building with 60 of his relatives.
"We are angry at both of them (the rebels and the government), because the rebels entered Ras Al Ain and because the regime bombed us with its aircraft," Mohammed said.
Roughly half of Ras Al Ain's population is said to be Kurdish.
"The FSA has to know that their enemy is not in Ras Al Ain and in other Kurdish areas.
Speaking by phone from the Kurdish-controlled Syrian town of Qoubani, Aloush said his Kurdish faction would not use force to push Syrian rebel groups out of Ras Al Ain.
On Friday, the Turkish government once again denounced the Syrian regime, claiming it had no legitimacy.
But Turkey has failed to deter the Syrian military from carrying out operations within sight of the Turkish border.
