RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (CNN) -- The office of Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas has a bank of six flat-screen televisions covering most of one wall, showing all the main international English-language news channels, and several local ones besides.
In fact, I rather get the impression Abbas, who has become the face of the army's operation against Taliban militants in the Swat Valley, watches our coverage closely.
Whatever Abbas thinks of CNN, he is more than willing to explain how the Pakistan army sees the broad picture as it fights in the Swat Valley.
The United States should "stop worrying about the nukes and start worrying about the weapons lost in Afghanistan," he says.
When I ask what that means, he smiles and says he can't elaborate -- declining to repeat the speculation in the press here that India, Pakistan's traditional rival, may be somehow involved in stirring up trouble on Pakistan's northwestern border.
The military wants to get done in Swat as soon as possible, but the general acknowledges its troops will be there for some time.
But they are also prepared for the conflict to be taken to other parts of Pakistan.
And then there is also the risk of the Taliban using the mass exodus of civilians from the Swat Valley as cover to penetrate other towns and cities.
He describes the conflict in Swat as "an existential threat" -- a fight for the very existence of Pakistan in its current form.
