(CNN) -- Thousands of children in England have been sexually exploited by gangs or groups of men or are at high risk of sexual exploitation, according to a report released Wednesday.
Maggie Atkinson, Children's Commissioner for England, described the report, titled "I thought I was the only one.
The impact on their lives is devastating.
The men were all of Asian origin and the girls were white, prompting questions over whether the perpetrators' ethnic origin was a factor in their actions or in the failure of local authorities to uncover the child abuse ring sooner.
Atkinson, the Children's Commissioner for England, urged people to look out for the signs of sexual exploitation in young people around them.
The furor erupted several weeks ago with the claims against Savile, who died last year but who police now believe sexually abused as many as 300 young women and girls, sometimes on BBC premises, in past decades.
A number of government inquiries have been launched as a result of questions over how past allegations were handled.
