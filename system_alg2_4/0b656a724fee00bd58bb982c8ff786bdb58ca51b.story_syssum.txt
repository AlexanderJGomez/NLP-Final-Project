Cleveland Clinic doctors replaced 80 percent of a woman's face two weeks ago in the first such U.S. surgery.
The patient is doing well, the doctors said.
In the surgery, 80 percent of the woman's face was transplanted.
"Our hope is she should be able to smile again," said Dr. Frank A. Papay, chairman of the Dermatology and Plastic Surgery Institute at the Cleveland Clinic.
Siemionow said the patient never saw a photo of the donor and said, "the donor never looks like the recipient.
"This patient exhausted all conventional means of reconstruction and is the right patient," she said.

The current face transplant patient understood the risk of rejection and of immunosuppressants, doctors said.
"With something like a liver or kidney transplant, it's a life or death transplant," Clark said.
Doctors at the Cleveland Clinic said that because the patient has limited vision after the surgery, she has yet to see herself.
"At this point she can't see herself but can feel her face," Siemionow said.
Siemionow said the patient will need re-educate her facial motion and need three to six months of nerve regeneration.
