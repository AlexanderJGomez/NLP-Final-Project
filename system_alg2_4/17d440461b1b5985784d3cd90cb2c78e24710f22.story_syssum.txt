Google launched a tool called Helpouts on Tuesday in which people can pay to get help from experts over a live video chat similar to Google Hangouts.
To start, Google has more than 1,000 providers signed up to offer things such as music lessons, cooking demonstrations and basic home repair tips.
There are videos for tech support, self-improvement, learning new skills and changing a light bulb.
But some problems and lessons need more than a one-sided demonstration.
Sometimes you need somebody to look over your shoulder, somebody to show you the way," said Udi Manber, Google's vice president of engineering.
Osi Imeokparia, director of product management, had a cooking teacher show her how to properly zest a lemon, and a home repair expert talked her through patching a hole in drywall.
Making its Helpouts free is smart marketing for Sephora, which can suggest its own products during the video sessions.
For now, Google is screening people and companies that want to offer their services through Helpouts.
There is no framework for getting a Helpout session covered by insurance, but Google thinks the category has potential to become a regular part of modern health care.
In addition to the website, there is an Helpouts Android app.
Payment is handled by Google Wallet, and all the prices are set by the experts offing the Helpouts.
People who want to share their expertise for free could also flock to Helpouts, according to Manber, who said it could open up a whole new new way to volunteer.
