But a new line of Harry Potter stamps released this week by the U.S.
As the former head of the American Philatelic Society (that's a stamp collecting society to the rest of us) noted:  "Harry Potter is not American.
At this point, I'd be all for a stamp bearing the image of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford smoking crack if that could generate revenue.
But the "American experience" is not just colored by U.S. citizens.
This is not the first time a new set of stamps has caused controversy.
Why?
Rather, it's because stamp purists are dismayed by the increasing commercialization of U.S. postage stamps.
Keep in mind that the stamp featuring Elvis Presley is the top seller of all time with over 700 million sold.
So I say it's time for the Postal Service to roll out stamps that will make money.
