KEY WEST, Florida (CNN)  -- The USNS General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, a retired U.S. Navy warship, embarked on a sedentary new career Wednesday on the floor of the Gulf of Mexico.
The 17,250-ton ship sank in less than two minutes, said Andy Newman, spokesman for the Florida Keys Tourism Council.
About 300 boats positioned themselves as close as possible to the site, and cheers went up when the Vandenberg slipped beneath the water seven miles south of Key West, the spokesman said.
To sink the Vandenberg, holes were made above the waterline in the side of the ship and throughout various decks, Newman said.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration projects that the Vandenberg artificial reef will result in an annual increase of about $7.5 million in expenditures in the economy of Monroe County, which includes Key West.
During the 1950s the ship was used to transport refugees from Europe and Australia to America.
In the 1960s the Air Force used the Vandenberg to track missiles.
The Vandenberg was chosen from among 400 decommissioned military vessels mainly based on appearance: "her topside structure, her smooth, interesting hull lines, big girth and her starring role in a motion picture," Newman said.
The largest ship ever scuttled to create an artificial reef was the decommissioned aircraft carrier USS Oriskany, which sank to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico off the Florida coast in 2006, according to the U.S. Navy.
It sank in water about 212 feet deep.
