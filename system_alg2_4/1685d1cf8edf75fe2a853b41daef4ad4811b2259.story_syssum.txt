So I opted to continue to serve, even though I knew that I would have to hide my true identity.
For most of my career in the Navy, I lived two lives and went to work each day wondering if that would be my last.
In spite of the stress of living under "don't ask, don't tell" and the constant fear of losing my job, somehow my partner, Lynne Kennedy, an openly gay reference librarian at the Library of Congress, and I had learned to deal with the policy and make the requisite sacrifices.
At 9:30 a.m.
As the numbness began to wear off, it hit me how incredibly alone Lynne would have been had I been killed.
But none of that support would have been available for Lynne, because under "don't ask, don't tell," she couldn't exist.
Eight months later, in June 2002, I retired after more than 29 years in the U.S. Navy, an organization I will always love and respect.
I have every confidence that our military will easily adjust to this change and that with strong leadership, we will ultimately be stronger and better for it.
I have great love and respect for our country, but I know we can do better than "don't ask, don't tell."
