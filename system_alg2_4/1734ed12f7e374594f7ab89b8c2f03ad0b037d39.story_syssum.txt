(CNN)A few days ago, when British journalist Charlene White posted on Twitter an apparently unretouched photo of supermodel Cindy Crawford, she launched a firestorm of debate over what women's bodies should look like as they get older.
So it's no surprise that when photo of Crawford was shared all over social media, many people commended White for making it public and Crawford for having "the guts" to open herself up to such scrutiny.
The image was shared by White without Crawford's knowledge or permission.
White said to CNN, "I want people to feel like magazines aren't responsible for their happiness when it comes to their bodies, but magazines also have a responsibility to show us an array of images.
In releasing the image, White made an example of one woman's body to satisfy a personal agenda -- that magazines should show more "realistic" images of women.
She is beautiful, to be sure, but what we're celebrating as "real" are her flaws.
After all, we call women like 32-year-old Australian model Erin McNaught, who released photos of her toned body four weeks after giving birth, "vain," "insecure," and "attention-seeking" because we don't find any comfort in seeing those photos.
We like it because it's a little startling and a little unattractive, and therefore makes us feel better about ourselves.
We're using her to make ourselves feel better.
