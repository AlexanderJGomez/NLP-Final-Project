A recruitment video aimed at English speakers.
The ISIS fighter, who speaks perfect English with a North American accent, is shown orchestrating the mass execution of a group of men.
In the video titled "Flames of War," the jihadist first appears speaking Arabic in a classical dialect and with the ease of a native Arabic speaker, CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said.
CNN cannot independently verify that the men in the video were soldiers, as the propaganda video claims.
"Why?
Intelligence officials will sift through every detail of the man's voice, looking for any clues of a particular dialect that might lead investigators to local communities to seek additional clues, Cilluffo said.
The video is undoubtedly propaganda and a recruitment piece for the terrorist group, Cruickshank said.
"It serves as not only a powerful recruitment piece, but a stern warning to their opposition about 'flames of war' rising against them by the fighters," according to a summary by SITE.
