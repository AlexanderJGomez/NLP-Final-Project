New Delhi (CNN)If there were an annual prize for the "World's Most Hopeful Economy," it would likely go to India.
Modi has fashioned a role for himself not only as CEO of India Inc. but also as its global ambassador, with blockbuster speeches promoting India in New York, Tokyo and Sydney.
After all, hope can only go so far.
That suggests 2015 will be a defining year for India.
By year-end, prices had halved.
India's government will look to use that money well.
In any case, India needs much more money and investment, likely from abroad.
Can Modi legislate as well as he can campaign?
These are all questions that Modi will need to answer in 2015.
He will look to strike deals not only with Obama, but with many other world leaders in 2015 -- on energy, trade, defense and infrastructure partnerships.
The great unknown is how he will respond to a major foreign policy crisis, the likes of which he largely escaped in 2014.
Can India remain everyone's friend?
A year on, New York City received Modi as if he were a rock star.
In 2015, Modi will need not only to be a voice of reason, but he will also have to rein in radical fringe elements of his Hindu support base.
How can that be good enough for a country that aspires to be a major world power?
My optimism is based less on politics or economics, and more on a larger trend: the country's technology boom.
So, expect India to start leapfrogging many of the problems the West has spent decades dealing with: India has never had a real database of its citizens, but soon it will be the first country to have an entirely digital biometric ID system.
This will be India's real revolution, and it is already underway.
