For most of history, it was extremely difficult to come by information about what was happening anywhere else.
Much of what we now take for granted as news has its origins in the information needed by people taking major decisions or at the center of national affairs.
Every day the news gives us stuff that is both interesting for some people and irrelevant to you.
So if you were wondering whether this might be a good time to launch your leadership bid, this would be a good piece to read.
We keep getting information that isn't really for us to know what to do with.
It's not our fault.
Indeed, we badly need people whose attention is not caught up in the trends of the moment and who are not looking in the same direction as everyone else.
But it can also be the mark of deep and important originality.
The news wants you to keep reading, but you also know there are times you should stop.
We need news sabbaths.
We need, on occasion, to be able to rise up into the air, to a place where that particular conference and this particular epidemic, that new phone and this shocking wildfire, will lose a little of their power to affect us -- and where even the most intractable problems will seem to dissolve against a backdrop of the stars above us.
