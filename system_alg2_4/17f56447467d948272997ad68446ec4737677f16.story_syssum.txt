(CNN)Police rescued 37 babies and a 3-year-old girl after busting a child trafficking ring in eastern China's Shandong province, reported the state-run China Central Television.
And they were allegedly fed instant noodles and leftover vegetables, according to Chinese state media.
The babies are then sold after the women give birth," says Chen.
They let the babies eat instant noodles," said Hou Jun, a local police officer.
Child trafficking has become a major concern in China, as traffickers seek to profit off a growing demand for healthy babies from potential adoptive parents both in China and beyond.
In March last year, Chinese officials uncovered four child-trafficking rings and arrested more than a thousand people for using websites and instant messaging groups to sell babies.
