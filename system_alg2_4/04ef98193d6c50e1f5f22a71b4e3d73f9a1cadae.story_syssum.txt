Washington (CNN) -- Sanctions.
United States -- It is hard to imagine a scenario that would cause U.S. troops to get involved in Ukraine.
Previously, Washington halted ongoing military cooperation with Russia.
While no obligation exists for NATO to militarily defend Ukraine against Russian aggression, the United States and Britain -- along with Russia -- committed to protecting Ukrainian independence and territorial integrity in 1994 when Kiev gave up its nuclear arsenal that dated back to the Soviet era.
The United States -- President Barack Obama said Thursday that he signed an executive order that laid the groundwork for sanctions against people and entities deemed responsible for the crisis.
Already, Russia threatens to retaliate with its own sanctions if the United States and Europe take such a step.
In addition, Russia is the single biggest supplier of energy to the European Union.
United States -- Kerry announced $1 billion in loan guarantees for Ukraine this week as part of the Obama administration's effort to publicly support the interim government and provide incentive for Ukraine to continue to align itself with the West through the European Union instead of Russia.
Europe -- The European Union announced Wednesday it will offer Ukraine at least $15 billion in aid as the country struggles with dwindling cash and the military standoff with Russia.
United States -- The United States is working with European allies to create an "exit ramp" for Putin to be able to de-escalate the Ukraine crisis.
The foundation of the U.S. stance is for Ukraine to maintain its independence and territorial integrity, while also recognizing Russia's historical and economic ties to Ukraine.
Reflecting the standoff, Merkel said Thursday that the European Union wants to do everything it can to settle the Ukraine crisis diplomatically, but she warned that without any "diplomatic possibility," steps such as asset freezing and visa limitations would be options.
