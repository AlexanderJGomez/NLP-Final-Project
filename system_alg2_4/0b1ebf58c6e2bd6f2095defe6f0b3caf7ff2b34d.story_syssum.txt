Imagine faceless figures throwing stones at her.
Imagine a country where lawyers, journalists, human rights and women's rights advocates who courageously speak out against unjust laws often face grave consequences such as detention or exile.
With the establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979, Islamic fundamentalism took over the laws of the country.
The Islamic Penal Code of Iran specifies stoning as the punishment for a married woman or man found guilty of adultery.
Stoning is a verdict set by God.
Each time someone is sentenced to stoning, human rights and women's rights advocates coordinate efforts to remind the world of the unjust laws in Iran.
In spite of the efforts of human rights and women's rights advocates to raise awareness about the systematic and comprehensive violations of human rights in Iran, stoning remains a legitimate punishment for adultery in the Islamic Penal Code.
For as long as the world neglects the human rights situation in Iran, more women and men will have to face their horrifying destiny, as determined by unjust laws, all alone.
