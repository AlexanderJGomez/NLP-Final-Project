(CNN) -- The small plane had crashed in an extremely remote part of Alaska, miles from the tiny village of St. Mary's.
Had it not been for her going for help, more victims might have died, said Clifford Dalton, a paramedic for LifeMed Alaska.
"What's really remarkable about it is that she was tending to her infant child that was gravely injured at the time."
Dalton said he and his partner, Paul Garnet, helped treat the patients at the site.
Authorities are unsure why Hageland Aviation Flight 1453 crashed.
Four of those injured were hospitalized in fair condition, officials said.
A spokeswoman for the the Alaska Native Medical Center said Melanie Coffee was in fair condition and wasn't giving interviews.
