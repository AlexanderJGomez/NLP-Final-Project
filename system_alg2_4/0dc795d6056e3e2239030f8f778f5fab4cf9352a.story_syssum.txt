Hack.
The sharks arrived and disappeared quickly.
Nevertheless, I managed to get out of bed on time, and actually felt pretty decent as we drove two hours from Cape Town to some quiet fishing village where about 30 cold, tired backpackers squeezed onto an old boat and into the sea in search of great white sharks.
But just as quickly as the sharks arrived, they were gone.
As it turns out, the English seemed to be the ones most affected by the sea.
Of course, I chalk this up mostly to the early start and cold weather, but, even at its best, I've definitely had better times in my life.
Hack.
Snort.
