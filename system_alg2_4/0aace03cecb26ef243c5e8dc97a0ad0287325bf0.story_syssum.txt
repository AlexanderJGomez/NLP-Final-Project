Rio de Janeiro (CNN) -- Security for Pope Francis' visit to Brazil has been raised after an incident involving his motorcade, a Brazilian federal official told CNN.
The Vatican told reporters that 500,000 people came to Copacabana Beach for the opening ceremony and Mass.
A large crowd -- braving rain -- cheered as the pope emerged from the helicopter that took him to the site, where he held Mass.
"It is true that nowadays, to some extent, everyone, including our young people, feels attracted by the many idols which take the place of God and appear to offer hope: money, success, power, pleasure," Francis said.
