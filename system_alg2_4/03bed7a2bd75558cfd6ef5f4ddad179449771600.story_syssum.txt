Florence, Italy (CNN) -- Amanda Knox vowed Friday to fight her conviction for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher "until the very end" and said she "will never go willingly" back to Italy.
An appeals court found Knox and her former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, guilty of murder in the Italian city of Florence after a retrial.
But Simon said it was too early to talk about extradition since there is still an appeals process to go through, which will probably last another year.
"I will never go willingly back to the place where I -- I'm gonna fight this until the very end," she said.
And with a great deal of family support, they're going to go forward and appeal what we would characterize as a completely unjust conviction," Simon said.
Sollecito's lawyer, Luca Maori, said his client was indeed in Udine with his girlfriend.
Sollecito was sentenced to 25 years in prison.
Her sister, Stephanie Kercher, said the family might never know exactly what happened on the night of her death.
Lyle Kercher, Meredith's brother, said the family may have to wait until spring 2015 for a final resolution, since the verdicts reached Thursday can still be appealed at Italy's Supreme Court.
Stephanie Kercher said that she had been told of a letter written by Knox to the Kercher family but that she had not seen it.
It would be very difficult to meet someone having had all that happen."
Knox, who remained at home in Seattle, Washington, while the retrial was held, said in a written statement Thursday that her conviction would bring no consolation to the Kercher family.
