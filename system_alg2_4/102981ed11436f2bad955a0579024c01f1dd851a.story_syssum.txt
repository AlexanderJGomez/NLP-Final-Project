(CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is not in a coma and is continuing to make strides in his recovery, his brother said.
"We are sure that with the support of God, science and the people, our president will emerge from this new battle," the brother said.
The crowd repeated his words, holding thousands of tiny copies of the constitution up in the air.
Before he left for Cuba for surgery, Chavez said he wanted Maduro to assume the presidency if he becomes incapacitated and called on voters to support him at the polls.
