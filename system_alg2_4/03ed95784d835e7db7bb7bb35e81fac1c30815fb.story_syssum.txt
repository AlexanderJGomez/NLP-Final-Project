A Philadelphia priest convicted of a sex crime involving a 10-year-old boy has died while awaiting appeal, his church said Tuesday.
The Superior Court of Pennsylvania granted and heard arguments from Engelhardt last month as part of his year-and-a-half appeals process.
They were among dozens of Philadelphia priests accused of sex abuse in a grand jury report.
A parochial teacher, Bernard Shero, who authorities said raped the same boy in 2000, was convicted of rape, attempted rape, involuntary deviant sexual intercourse, indecent sexual assault and other charges.
