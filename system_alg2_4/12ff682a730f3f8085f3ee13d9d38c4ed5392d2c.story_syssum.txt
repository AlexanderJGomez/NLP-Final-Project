Whale spouts are spotted from shore; seals stretch and bark on the rocks; and tourists in search of stunning Pacific Coast views are drawn to the iconic Highway 101 en masse.
It's a small dot on the map between Coos Bay and Newport, but slipping by Florence, Oregon, and all this historical city offers, would be a shame.
Florence has a charming old-world downtown, the Siuslaw River curves along its edges, offering spectacular natural views, and it is located along what is arguably the most beautiful and diverse section of the Oregon Coast.
Today, this restaurant is one of the best places to watch the river crawl by while swilling a Mango Mint Fizz -- a sublime mixture of rum, mango juice, lemon juice, simple syrup and soda.
After dinner, make sure to find Gazebo Park, a small, nearly hidden patch tucked away off Bay Street.
Most rooms have views of either the river or the famous Oregon sand dunes.
If you're in the mood for adventure and don't mind getting a little sand in your teeth, head south out of Florence for an off-highway vehicle tour of the famous Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area.
Here, toast-colored sand dunes tower some 500 feet above sea level, and, in select areas, off-highway vehicle rentals zoom around and over the dunes at dizzying speeds.
For a closer look at some of Oregon's favorite residents, tour the Sea Lion Caves, a privately owned nature preserve just a few miles north of Florence up Highway 101.
Don't miss the newly renovated and working Heceta Head Lighthouse, which towers 205 feet above the Pacific and has a light beam visible 21 miles out to sea.
Rooms begin at $209 during the coveted high season (May through October).
Regulars have a few favorite spots including a small inlet up Highway 126 near the fork of the Siuslaw River.
