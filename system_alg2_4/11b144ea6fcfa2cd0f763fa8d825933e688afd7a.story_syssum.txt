Sheridan, 48, returns to the stand Friday after testifying all day Thursday in her legal battle with Cherry and ABC over the TV killing of a character she played on the hit comedy series for five seasons.
The hit was just "a light tap on the head" intended to demonstrate "a piece of physical humor" Cherry wanted Sheridan to perform, the defense said in opening statements Wednesday.
Sheridan testified that while she explained her concerns to Cherry, the producer asked "What is it that you want?"
The actress finally agreed to show jurors the hit in full force, sending a loud thump across the courtroom and turning Maloney's head.
The next day, she told show producer George Perkins she wanted a second apology and flowers from Cherry.
"He felt the incident had been resolved," Sheridan said he told her.
Sheridan lawyers Mark Baute, in his opening statement Wednesday, challenge the authenticity of those writers notes, accusing Cherry's defense of an "effort to backdate the decision" with a fake story that the character's death was planned months before the hitting incident.
Jurors appeared to enjoy several clips of the show, featuring her character seducing a series of men.
Cherry assured her that her character would "be saved" in the next episode at the start of season four, she said.
The character was not initially intended to be on the show beyond the pilot episode, but Cherry decided to make her the "blond bombshell who would sleep with the husbands of all of the wives," he said.
Although a line producer reported the incident to the studio's human resources department, there was no investigation until an ABC senior executive saw a National Inquirer story about it at a grocery store two months later, Baute said.
The human resources investigator never interviewed Cherry or Sheridan about the incident, only three people who worked for Cherry, Baute said.
