The comedian was quick-witted and sharp-tongued, known for standing on the red carpet or presiding over her show "Fashion Police" and, she said, saying the things that other people were thinking.
"My mother's greatest joy in life was to make people laugh.
"I hate housework," went one of her jokes.
"My heart is torn in half," said Silverman in a tweet.

The two Rivers became mainstays of awards season -- later for the TV Guide Channel -- with Joan known for mocking celebrities and their outfits there and on the show "Fashion Police."
Rivers attended Barnard College and had dreams of making it as an actress, a dream both parents discouraged.
A 1965 booking on Carson made her career.
"Joan and Edgar, pursued by the same ghosts and hurts, feeling mutually threatened by adversaries real and imagined, trusted only each other and existed as an island built from intense and protective loyalty," wrote the magazine's Richard Meryman.
Indeed, she often took refuge in work, whether it was writing books, mocking celebrities, starring in Las Vegas or even appearing in a documentary about her life, 2010's "Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work."
She was well aware of her personality, once describing herself as "screaming her way through life."
In 1978, Rivers directed a movie, "Rabbit Test," starring Billy Crystal as the world's first pregnant man.
Rivers shrugged that off.
Rivers immediately struck back: "She has been touched up more than a choirboy at the Vatican," she told the New York Post.
It's my job to make them laugh, and I'm a professional, and my husband was a professional," she told People two weeks after her husband died.
She had a successful jewelry line that she sold on QVC.
