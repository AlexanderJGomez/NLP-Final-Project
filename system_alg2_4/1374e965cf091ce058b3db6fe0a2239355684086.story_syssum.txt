Bob Greene says athletes like Lebron James show us the difference between ordinary effort and excellence.
The answer may be found in a single sentence written by a man who died at the age of 76 in this still-new year.
But of all the sentences Updike ever wrote, there is one that I have long encouraged people to carry around with them -- if not literally tucked into their wallets, then somewhere in their heads and in their hearts.
But it is another sentence in the story that explains everything -- not just about sports, but about the lives the rest of us can lead.
On fields of play -- baseball diamonds, football fields, a basketball court like the one on which Sunday's All-Star Game will be held -- the tissue-thin difference is there for the world to see.
Updike's tissue-thin difference.
Are the rest of us the same as the players on the court?
And yet, the one way in which we can be the same, or at least strive to, is in that pursuit of the tissue-thin difference.
We wait for them.
