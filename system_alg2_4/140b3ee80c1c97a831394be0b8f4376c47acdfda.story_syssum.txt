A crucial difference in the Flight 8501 event is that the airplane had been in constant radar contact, at least from the information provided thus far.
Radar data from air traffic control can provide tracking data that will indicate the flight path, altitude and direction the A320-200 followed.
No matter how obvious it might appear, airplane incidents and accidents generally involve more than one factor.
Experience dictates much of the decision process that airline pilots use to deviate around convective weather.
And let's not be misled by the reported request of Flight 8501 asking air traffic control for a higher altitude.
But there may be other contributing factors to the possible loss of AirAsia Flight 8501.
Although the A320 is designed to continue flying without engine power, being able to control it at high altitude would be a challenge, especially in turbulent conditions.
Perhaps a high altitude stall occurred and the airplane never recovered.
Bigger miracles have occurred.
