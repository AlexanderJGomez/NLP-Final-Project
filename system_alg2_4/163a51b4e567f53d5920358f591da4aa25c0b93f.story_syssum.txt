Mushfiqur Rahim delayed the end with a stroke-filled 101 after opener Tamim Iqbal bolstered the innings with 52, but the home side -- 67 for two at the start of play -- were bowled out for 301.
But Sehwag brought himself on just before the lunch interval and struck in his second over, luring Tamim into a wild slash and inducing the edge, Dravid completing the dismissal with a sharp catch at slip.
But that reprieve hardly proved costly as Mishra held a low return catch from Shafiul in the next over to send back the batsman.
With an attacking field in place, runs were there for the taking and Mushfiqur cashed in, reaching his maiden century with a straight-driven boundary off Mishra, his 17th boundary.
