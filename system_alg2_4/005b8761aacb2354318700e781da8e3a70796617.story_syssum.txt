(CNN) -- Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir arrived in neighboring South Sudan on Monday for talks on unrest in the latter nation that has left hundreds dead.
Meanwhile, talks between South Sudan's government and rebels began Monday in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
The negotiations "come not a moment too soon," African Union Chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said in a statement.
South Sudan erupted in violence on December 15 when rebels loyal to ousted Vice President Riek Machar tried to stage a coup.
South Sudan seceded from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war, making it the world's youngest nation.
Though South Sudan and Sudan divorced, they still have unresolved oil issues.
