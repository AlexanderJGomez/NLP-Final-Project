Simon Schaefer is the founder of Factory, a 16,000-square-meter co-working space in Berlin designed to cultivate entrepreneurship.
The big and important difference between other work spaces and us is that we're stage agnostic so we have later-stage companies or established companies like Mozilla, local heroes like Soundcloud or Wunderkinder, which are role models for younger founders to look up to.
SS: I think what you should do is look at the individual stages of development of the company.
And so I think not only do the founders of those companies invest and engage with early-stage companies, but also they still have to touch base with what they were like a few years ago.
If you look at real estate as a business, start-ups are probably your worst clients.
And I think we've succeeded by being very flexible and having short-term and long-term spaces for their individual stages.
