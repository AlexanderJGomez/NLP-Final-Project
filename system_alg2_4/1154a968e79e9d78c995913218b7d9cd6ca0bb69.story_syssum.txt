ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- More than 80 years after his family was ordered from the country, the grandson of one of the last Ottoman sultans was buried Saturday as hundreds of admirers looked on.
"His death marks the passing of an era," wrote Jason Goodwin, author of "Lords of the Horizons," which tells the history of the Ottoman Empire, in an e-mail to CNN.
In 1922, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the modern Turkish Republic, sent the last Ottoman sultan packing aboard a British warship.
Ertugrul Osman, who had played as a boy in the imperial palaces of Istanbul, was sent with the rest of his family into exile.
Over the years, Osman told reporters he had no interest in assuming the Ottoman throne.
The hundreds of mourners at Saturday's funeral stunned other surviving members of the Ottoman royal family.
"I am quite surprised.
Osman's death serves as a reminder of Turkey's recent, yet often forgotten Ottoman history, said historian Jason Goodwin.
"His funeral may be a catalyst for modern, republican Turkey to overcome its historical amnesia, and come to terms with its own past," Goodwin said.
