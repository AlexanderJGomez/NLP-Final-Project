(CNN) -- Despite decades of propaganda from marijuana prohibitionists, a majority of the American public has indeed said "enough" to the policies of cannabis criminalization.
... Demographic change and widespread public experience using marijuana imply that opposition to legalization will never again return to the levels seen in the 1980s.
Also last month, a May 2013 nationwide Fox News telephone poll, conducted by under the direction of Anderson Robbins Research and Shaw & Co. Research, reported that 85% of voters support allowing adults to use cannabis for therapeutic purposes.
Why?
Despite more than 70 years of federal prohibition, Americans' consumption of and demand for cannabis is here to stay.
Marijuana regulations can allow governments to establish legal parameters for where, when, and how markets operate.
Maybe an even more persuasive if not entirely counter-intuitive argument in favor of legalization as a means to actually deter youth use is found in recently released Gallup polling indicating a dramatic reduction in youth cannabis use rate as there is a surge in favor of cannabis legalization from virtually all segments of American society.
It is time to end our failed policies on marijuana criminalization and replace them with ones that regulate the cannabis market and allow for its private consumption by adults.
