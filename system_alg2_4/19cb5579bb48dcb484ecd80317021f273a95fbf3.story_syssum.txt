(InStyle.com) -- Actress Cameron Diaz talks candidly about love, guys, friends, family and charting her own course.
Her style is relaxed, never more evident than with her wardrobe.
I want to feel like I can go anywhere, whatever I'm wearing."
"I found these jeans today and was, like, 'Well hello, Abercrombie jeans!'
So, is Diaz dating?
"I'm a woman," she says, like, Duh!
"I trust my judgment," she says.
But ...
But when I got to 22, I realized that wasn't what I wanted, which was a huge lesson for me," she says.
I don't.
Diaz lives 45 minutes from her family and has always spent a great deal of time with them.
They're just really good, cool people."
Says Diaz: "I know I'll never be in a situation where I can't get to somebody for support."
In her interview, Diaz remembered how her dad taught a then scrawny young girl how to fight bullies in school.
Looks like that runs in the family.
