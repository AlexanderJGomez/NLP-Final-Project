It's a feat of endurance for drivers, engineers, car manufacturers, media and fans alike.
In the equivalent of 16 Formula One races completed back to back, the professional drivers take on treacherous night conditions and the risk of an accident with one of the amateur entries -- one ex-Formula One star ended last weekend's race in hospital after a spectacular spill.
He finished 15th overall on Sunday in his first Le Mans race since 2001, competing alongside his son Alex on Father's Day.
The drivers of the 35 cars that finished last weekend's race certainly earned a rest -- and a shoulder-rub or two -- in the days that follow Le Mans.
"At night it feels like a video game," said former F1 driver Karun Chandhok, after becoming the first Indian to race at Le Mans.
The potential rewards for car manufacturers at Le Mans are no less significant.
Race organizers, the Automobile Club de l'Ouest, also encourage car manufacturers to invest in testing and showcasing new technologies -- especially those with relevance to future road cars -- during the race weekend.
Highlighting "downsized technology," the car -- invited to race as a guest entry -- was half the weight of a typical Le Mans prototype and designed to consume half the usual fuel and tires.
With 55 assorted cars starting the race -- from Audi juggernauts to the racy Corvettes and Porsches -- there was plenty to quench the 250,000 car-thirsty fans who flocked to France.
Memories perhaps of men dressed as Pamela Anderson, complete with lifeguards, swaying mounds of glass beer bottles, $18 pizzas, a motorized wheelbarrow with a perilous pace and the whiff of rubber from an improvised burnout drag strip along the service roads.
