(CNN) -- The assistant coach of Togo's national soccer team is among the victims of Friday's machine-gun attack on a bus carrying the squad to a tournament in Angola, the country's official news agency reported Saturday.
Lamond said a third wounded person was being evacuated to Johannesburg, South Africa, for treatment.
The team was headed to Angola for the tournament when it was attacked near the border between Angola and the Republic of Congo.
He was not injured in the attack, Manchester City said.
Angolan officials -- trying to assuage security fears that could dampen the war-torn nation's sporting aspirations -- vowed to heighten security, particularly in Cabinda, a disputed oil-rich enclave located within the Democratic Republic of Congo and the site of eight matches in the tournament.
Leaders of the Confederation of African Football were expected to meet Saturday with Cassoma "to take decisions to guarantee the smooth running of the competition," a statement on that organization's Web site said.
It also marks the beginning of a year in the spotlight for African football, with South Africa set to become the continent's first country to host the FIFA World Cup in June.
Togo striker Thomas Dossevi, who plays for French team Nantes, told CNN "armed rebels" with AK-47s had opened fire.

The attack lasted for 10-15 minutes, " Dossevi said.
Togo is a strip of a nation that averages about 60 miles wide, nestled between Benin and Ghana in West Africa.
