However, African observers say the growth of simple communication technologies like cell phones are assisting many states to progress towards open and fair elections in increasingly democratic systems.
"With communication and cell phones, this is where it is difficult to cheat in elections now.
Just this month CNN reported dramatic increases in cell phone usage in African nations.
"During the 2006 local government elections in Senegal, Radio Sud used reporters and correspondents with cell phones to call in what they saw.
Civilians and independent election observers outside the media have also taken advantage of cell phones to monitor elections.
"All of this technology is very important and gives a powerful new tool that cuts the ability for cheating," LaGamma said.
Despite the positive developments brought by cell phones and other communication technology, there have still been problems with numerous elections in recent years.
Although there has undoubtedly been positive progress with cell phone technology, most scholars and observers agree that pockets full of mobile handsets will not be enough to build stable democratic states and hold future fair elections.
"That said, new technology can be a powerful tool in improving communications between citizens and governments, between civil society organizations and the public.
Gellar said new technology could help achieve those goals to some extent, as communication was the key to overcoming oppression.
African authoritarian regimes don't have the power and resources to completely control information disseminated through traditional means -- as oral communications are still the main means of disseminating information," Geller explained.
