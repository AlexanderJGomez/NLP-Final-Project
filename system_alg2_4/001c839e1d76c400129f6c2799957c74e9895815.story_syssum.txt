These men are part of the country's Ebola response team, specifically tasked with burying anyone suspected to have died of the Ebola virus.
Now almost anytime there is a suspected Ebola death in the community, they call in the Ebola response team to come and bury the body safely.
"When it started, it wasn't that easy," says Alpha Tamba, an Ebola response coordinator in Lofa County.
The Lofa County health team arrives carrying gloves, gowns, goggles and diluted bleach.
Before they enter the house to collect the body, one of them goes in and sprays the house with bleach.
A few kilometres away from the village is Zango Town: most of the houses here have been abandoned, their doors padlocked and windows shuttered.
They died," he says.
"So many people die -- the houses on your right and even the houses on your left.
Home to more than 8,000 people, Barkedu is now under quarantine: no one can go in, and no one can go out.

Sometimes when they are called in to investigate a case, they get there only to discover the victim is one of their own.
"Sometimes we go to bed and we dream of nothing else but Ebola, Ebola, Ebola -- nothing else," he explains.
"It is difficult to stand in front of Ebola, but this is the situation we have," he says.
We have to fight it.
