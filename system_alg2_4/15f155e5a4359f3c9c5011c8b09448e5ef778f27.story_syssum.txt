The shooting began after the student walked into Arapahoe High School in Centennial with the intention of confronting a specific faculty member, Robinson said.
One person -- a minor -- was taken to Littleton Adventist Hospital with a gunshot wound, Lauren Brendel, a hospital spokeswoman, told CNN.
But Robinson told reporters that the condition of a  a 15-year-old girl who was shot was in critical condition after surgery.
Pierson walked into Arapahoe High School carrying a shotgun and made no attempt to hide it, Robinson said.
I said, 'They are shooting in the school.'"
The faculty member "left that school in an effort to try to encourage the shooter to also leave the school."
In addition to the shotgun, authorities found two Molotov cocktails inside the school, Robinson said.
He was honestly incredibly humble and down to earth.
While authorities hunted for the student gunman inside the school, students were locked in their classrooms.
Leytoldt said she was in yoga class and that her teacher told all the students to get into a closet to protect them.
They soon heard people yelling, and walkie-talkies crackling, and then they heard police asking someone to drop the gun, put the gun down, and hold his arms up, she said.
Colton Powers told CNN affiliate KDVR that he heard gunfire during his English class.
Within about 14 minutes of the initial report, "we had information on the radio that my deputies believed they had the shooter down inside the school," Robinson said.
The high school, with a student population of 2,229 students, has 70 classrooms.
President Barack Obama was briefed on the shooting, according to a White House official.
