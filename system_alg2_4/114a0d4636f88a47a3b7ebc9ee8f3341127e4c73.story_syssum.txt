San Pedro, Belize (CNN) -- A dead neighbor.
Police there are seeking to question Internet pioneer John McAfee in the killing of his neighbor, American businessman Gregory Faull.
Three people have been detained for questioning in the killing, police have said, and investigators are pursuing multiple leads.

"I am asking all people of conscience to read this blog ... and see the ugly truth unfolding here," reads one post that names six people he says have been detained by police in the case, including friends and household staff.
Faull was killed after four of 11 dogs belonging to McAfee were fatally poisoned, said Wired Magazine Contributing Editor Joshua Davis, who said he had spent more than 100 hours with McAfee in recent months.
McAfee, 67, told Davis last week that he did not kill his neighbor, the reporter said.
When asked why McAfee doesn't present himself to police for questioning, his former girlfriend said it is because authorities want to kill him.
That's what I believe, until they kill him," she said.
