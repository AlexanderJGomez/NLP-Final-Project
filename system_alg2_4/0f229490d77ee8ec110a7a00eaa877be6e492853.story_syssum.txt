"In our past writings, we have criticized both parties when we believed it was warranted.
"The GOP has become an insurgent outlier in American politics.
The debt showdown last summer was the ultimate case: congressional Republicans nearly forcing a default on the obligations of the United States to get their way on a budget agreement.
For example: Because Senate rules often require unanimous consent to move to the next order of business, a determined minority can force delay on almost any action it opposes.
At the corresponding moment in the Obama administration, Memorial Day 2010, 108 nominees were awaiting action by the Senate.
In the second Clinton administration, facing a Republican Senate, only 74% of nominees were confirmed, taking an average of 110 days.
If those proposals have a faint wistful air to them, blame the inherent difficulty of the problem, not Mann and Ornstein.
In good times, we debate whether government should expand programs or cut taxes -- new benefits in either case.
The Republican voting base includes not only the wealthy with the most to fear from tax increases, but also the elderly and the rural, the two constituencies that benefit the most from federal spending and thus have the most to lose from spending cuts.
Which means the solution to the problems so astutely diagnosed by Mann and Ornstein must ultimately be found outside the American political system -- and will not be solved until America's rich and America's elderly become either less fearful or more generous.
