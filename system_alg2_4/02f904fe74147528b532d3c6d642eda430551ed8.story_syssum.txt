While some authors choose to write under a pen name as a form of artistic expression, many female authors purposefully opt for a male pseudonym to appeal to a wider audience, says Carmela Ciuraru, author of "Nom de plume: A (secret) history of pseudonyms".
Best known for her seminal tale "Little Women", Louisa May Alcott, spent much of her early career writing under the nom de plume A. M. Barnard.
After a highly successful career as a novelist under her own name, Nora Roberts decided to adopt a more elusive tag for her "...in Death" collection: a canon comprising of 43 published works, with three more set for release later this year.
Publishing an essay in 1856 entitled "Silly Novels by Lady Novelists," Evans lambasted the glut of unremarkable work produced by women in the era, which she believed diminished the credibility of female writers as a whole.
They may have been proven correct, as their first novel has spawned a successful sequel with the male nom de plume still intact.
"Charlotte really believed in their talents, and was actually very controlling about the publication of their work," says Ciuraru.
