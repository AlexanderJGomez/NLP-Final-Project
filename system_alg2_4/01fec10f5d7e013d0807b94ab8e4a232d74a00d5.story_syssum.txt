COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Sri Lankan soldiers seized a key rebel stronghold over the weekend, as humanitarian agencies feared for the safety of civilians.

The rebels gained control over Mullaittivu in 1996 and established a military garrison there, according to the government.
Earlier this month, troops regained control of the northern town of Elephant Pass, the point at which mainland Sri Lanka links to the northern Jaffna peninsula.
"They lost ... about 90 percent of what they had."
"Some Sri Lankan U.N. staff are trapped there," he said in a Sunday interview.
The Sri Lankan authorities "are also directly responsible for subjecting journalists to harassment and interrogation," she said.
Others have been driven from the country by death threats, or in fear of detention and torture by government authorities, it said.
