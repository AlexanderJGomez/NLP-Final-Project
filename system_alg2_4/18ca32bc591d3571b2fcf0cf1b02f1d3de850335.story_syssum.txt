She says she wasn't being dismissive of the women who've accused Bill Cosby of sexual assault when she came to the comedian's defense in an online interview.
And in an interview with Showbiz 411, Rashad said she never saw any indication of the behavior that the women have attributed to Cosby.
Fast forward to Wednesday night.
"What I said is, 'this is not about the women.
"
He continued, "She meant, 'those women aside' -- as in, she's not talking about that, she's talking about Cosby's legacy being destroyed.
More than 20 women have come forward with claims, and a defamation lawsuit has been filed against Cosby.
"Phylicia, you should be supporting these women rather than joining Cosby's paid 'attack dogs' who are trying to undermine them in any way that they can," Allred said.
He was in Kitchener, Ontario, on Wednesday night for a standup appearance.
"I would like to personally thank you for giving me the opportunity to bring laughter back into your lives tonight," he said.
