asks Ginger the Robot, haltingly throwing up its arms in its best impression of a real-life comedian.
The cute little machine's monotone voice has all the drama of a conveyer belt, while its expression is as vacant as a doll.
"I was looking for a way to do a performance with a robot, and I was like 'hey, what about a comedy routine on stage?'
The unlikely partnership between researcher and robot is not without friction -- at one stage Ginger informs us Knight has been "cheating" on it.
There's only one way to win Knight back, it seems.
"People love when it goes all super-techy and acts like a real robot.
"Things like laughter, applause, these are symbolic things that we all do," says Knight.
Regardless of Ginger's comedic powers, the adorable bot could one day influence the "personalities" of other machines.
"When the robot makes fun of me, it means I can tell you about my research and it's like my own self-deprecation," explained the bubbly engineer, and you get the feeling her popularity is not just down to Ginger, but her own charismatic stage presence.
Boom!
