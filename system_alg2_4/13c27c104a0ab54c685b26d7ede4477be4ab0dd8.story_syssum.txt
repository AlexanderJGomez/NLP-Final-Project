Eleanor Coppola with husband Francis.
That was 47 years ago and since then the retiring artist has become something of a chronicler of the extraordinary Coppola family, which includes her flamboyant Oscar-winning husband, daughter, Sophia and actors Nicolas Cage and Jason Schwartzman.
Here Eleanor Coppola talks exclusively to CNN about her pride at seeing Sophia win an Oscar, what Francis is really like and just how close "Apocalypse Now" came to disaster.

TSR: Tell me about how the documentary you shot while Francis was making "Apocalypse Now" came about.
I just had never shot a documentary before.

That is just the way his life is.
He just doesn't see it that way.
EC: Well, I was deeply thrilled, particularly because she's a woman and I thought it was so touching that the children actually do reflect their parents and their upbringing and their parents' abilities do seem to have been passed on to their children.
