Now that they are home, or soon to be home, our country has a solemn obligation to help them transition back to civilian life.
Today, nearly one in five women who are veterans have delayed or gone without necessary health care in the past year.
The DAV report finds that the federal, state and community programs to support women making the transition out of military service have serious gaps that put some of them in jeopardy.
Today, one-third of the Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers lack a staff gynecologist and 18% of VA clinics have yet to hire at least one doctor specializing in women's health.
Yet the unemployment rate for female veterans has steadily climbed for most of the past decade, and is now higher than for male veterans.
These problems could soon get worse.
In our report, "Women Veterans: The Long Journey Home," DAV outlines 27 key policy and program recommendations that Congress, the administration, VA and the Departments of Defense, Labor, and Housing and Urban Development can take to strengthen the safety net for female veterans.
To help combat unemployment among female veterans, the Department of Defense must take a hard look at the primary program designed to help veterans go into the civilian labor force: the Transition Assistance Program.
Finally, as the VA and Defense work to strengthen services to servicewomen, these agencies need to invest in improved child care options.
They served this country faithfully.
