(CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin is considered a rising GOP star and the Republican Party's leader on fiscal and budgetary issues.
It's not the time to think about it," he told The Wall Street Journal in April.
In the House, Ryan is also a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee.
Ryan is considered a lightning rod, and his presence on the GOP ticket will fundamentally change the 2012 race.
"It would be a bold choice," CNN senior analyst David Gergen said earlier of a Romney-Ryan ticket.
"I think he does get Wisconsin," Green said.
Ask Paul Ryan and his friends in Congress."
This is the "bold" debate conservatives pushing Ryan want, but other Republicans worry it could steer the campaign focus away from the president and onto GOP proposals.
Ryan is also a policy wonk, a self-described nerd who cut his teeth working for conservatives Bill Bennett and Jack Kemp.
