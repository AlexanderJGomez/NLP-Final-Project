Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- Thirty-three people have now died from the MERS coronavirus, the World Health Organization said Friday.
A statement from the Saudi Ministry of Health said one of three new cases was a 21-year-old man who died after being admitted into intensive care this week.
Studies carried out by researchers from Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom have allowed them to map out the genetic characteristics of the MERS virus, the health ministry said in a statement.
A full genetic series, obtained from four infected cases in Al-Ahsa, was recorded in the gene bank, said ministry spokesman Dr. Khalid Marghlani.
Researchers can now start comparing the genetic sequences from these four recent Saudi patients to the genetic sequence from the first Saudi patient, which is also publicly available, he said.
Despite concerns about this new virus, there is "no evidence of widespread person-to-person transmission," according tothe WHO.
In addition, fewer MERS infections have been seen in health care workers than during the SARS epidemic, the WHO said.
