By late Saturday night, 72 bodies had been found floating in a river or in three mass graves inside the compound of the Rifles, or BDR, in the capital city, Dhaka, the Home Ministry said.
Another six were Rifles troops, or jawans.
Several women howled in despair and collapsed hopelessly on the pavement.
"But from the second day, when we started getting news of missing officers and seeing pictures of one body after another being pulled out, the perception changed," he said.
Killers will face trial, she said, and ordered jawans to return to their posts or report to police stations by the end of the day Sunday.
The fear of a military take-over is a pervasive one in Bangladesh.
"Hasina has her responsibility to keep peace and tranquility and so she did what she did," said Aneeqa Khan, a student who lives not far from the BDR headquarters.
The standoff started Wednesday when BDR troops rebelled against their commanders.
The BDR is a paramilitary force distinct from the army, but its commanders are career army officers.
Discontent had been bubbling for years in the ranks of the BDR, who complained their army superiors dismissed their appeals for more pay, subsidized food and their requests to participate in United Nations peacekeeping operations -- which pay far more than what they make at home.
Others were tossed in sewers that emptied into the Buriganga River, where they floated for miles before being retrieved.
