Located in Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park, Tasman Glacier on Tasman Lake is New Zealand's longest glacier at 27 kilometers.

Activities can be booked from the township of Franz Josef, located five kilometers away.
Running 450 kilometers from north to south, the Southern Alps form a natural range along the entire length of New Zealand's South Island.

"The braided river banks and mountain light make for some great landscape photography," says Hollman.
He recommends views of the river from State Highway 73, between Arthur's Pass and Christchurch.
