In experiments with the material in shrimp shells, called chitosan, and material from silk, known as fibroin, researchers at Harvard's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering put the two together at a nano level.
"It actually feels like a huge beetle shell, or cuticle," says Don Ingber, the director of the Wyss Institute.
Plastics are made in such quantity that they're both inexpensive and versatile, yet most aren't biodegradable.
Shrilk, on the other hand, is fully biodegradable, says Ingber -- a necessity if the product is to succeed.
There's plenty of raw material, says Ingber -- the seafood industry has so much shrimp shell discard "that they have to pay to get it cleared away sometimes" -- but there's still a ways to go.
"They are so rich in nutrients that you could put seeds in them, just in the broken down material, and a plant will grow," says Ingber.
Perhaps, a new part of the plastics industry will as well.
