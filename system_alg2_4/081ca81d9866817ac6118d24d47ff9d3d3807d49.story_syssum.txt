Washington (CNN) -- Three weeks until funding starts to dry up for bridge and road projects across the United States, House and Senate committees Thursday put Congress on track toward a deal to avoid construction shutdowns and to keep the federal Highway Trust Fund operating until early next summer.
Thursday both the Republican-led House Ways & Means Committee and the Democratic-led Senate Finance Committee passed bills with the same central dollar figure, $10.8 billion.
The bills are much closer on the amount of money they'd raise from an extended increase in customs fees.
Republican and Democratic senators stressed they had made compromises.
His Republican counterpart echoed the story of tradeoffs.
"I commend Chairman Wyden and Senator Hatch for putting together a bill that provides roughly $11 billion, as we did," wrote House Ways & Means Chairman Dave Camp in a statement.
Then the two sides must quickly agree to a compromise bill if they want to keep money flowing and avoid construction slowdowns starting in August.
But the politics are a problem.
Hence, what could be a rare ahead-of-deadline deal in Congress looks like continued instability and lack-of-decision to those in road construction.
