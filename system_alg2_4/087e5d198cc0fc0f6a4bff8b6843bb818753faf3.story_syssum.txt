(CNN) -- Despite all the political tension in Crimea, it's nice to know things are still safe enough at the zoo for a zebra to get it on with a donkey.
And Doing It.
Half donkey.
Though, when you think about it, that may or may not be a compliment to the publication.
Either way, Telegraph is just lucky to be alive.
Eventually, the zoo moved the lonely zebra into a different part of the complex where she could be surrounded by other hoofed animals.
Because now we have this silly looking thing with a brown upper body and zebra legs.
Of course, to be fair, all baby animals tend to be a big draw.
An adorable baby polar bear with a tortoise shell would pretty much stop the world from spinning.
But, no matter the species, whenever you get a cute baby cross-breed, you sort of have to enjoy it while you can.
I don't quite get it.
That said, being infertile might not be such a bad thing if, say, you're a rather confident liger and you do well at the clubs.
Telegraph, we like your stripes.
