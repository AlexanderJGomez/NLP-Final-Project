(CNN) -- George Clooney 1, Daily Mail newspaper 0.
"The Daily Mail has printed a completely fabricated story about my fiancee's mother opposing our marriage for religious reasons," Clooney wrote in USA Today.
We have family members all over the world, and the idea that someone would inflame any part of that world for the sole reason of selling papers should be criminal."
So was the Mail story completely made up?
