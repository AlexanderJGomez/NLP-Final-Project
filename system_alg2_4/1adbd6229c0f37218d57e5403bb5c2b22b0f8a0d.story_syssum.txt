Thulani Madondo: It means we can continue to grow as an organization, and it has helped us educate people about the life that we live here.
Madondo: KYP people heard me shouting, and they wanted to know what was happening.
Tears fell from my eyes, thinking how proud my mom was going to be seeing her struggle paying off to the nation.
We believe that is very important, so our team can also grow with the organization.
Madondo: The most important thing that I would like people to know about KYP is that it is an organization that is community-needs driven, and it is led by the youth of Kliptown that want to break the poverty cycle that has existed for many decades.
