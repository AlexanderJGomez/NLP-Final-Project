(CNN) -- For the Dawsons of Tauranga, New Zealand, the canoe slalom event at the London Olympics will be a family affair.
"The only real advantage mum can give me is her presence at what will be my biggest race ever," said Mike Dawson, who is competing in the Olympics for the first time after finishing 16th in the canoe slalom world championships in Slovakia last year.
As one of the gate judges, Kay Dawson has an important role, but her decisions will be scrutinized by other officials -- each gate judge also monitors the two gates on either side.
The International Canoe Federation, which selected her as the only judge from New Zealand for the Olympic event, agrees.
Despite the multitude of officials at the canoe slalom event, the role of individual judges is still significant, Kay Dawson has said.
Mike Dawson, who was born and raised in the Bay of Plenty region of New Zealand, says the best way for him to stamp out any perceptions of favoritism is to not make any mistakes.
He is not the only New Zealander competing in the canoe slalom: Luuka Jones, also from Tauranga, became the first New Zealand woman to compete in the kayak competition in the Olympics after qualifying for the 2008 Beijing Games.
"I can see how people get intimidated, but really it's just like a hotel with an epic food court."
