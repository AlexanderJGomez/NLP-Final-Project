Yes, that's right:  Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy told WGN Radio this week that Chicago's homicide rate is "still ahead of where we were last year, which was a record."
"People always say, 'I don't feel much better, even though shootings might be down by 40%,'" McCarthy told CNN.
If you have 10 shootings in your neighborhood last year, and you have six shootings in your neighborhood this year, do you feel 40% better?
"We are getting out in front of a lot of shootings," the police chief told CNN.
"The studies show when there's more restrictive gun laws, there's less gun violence.
But we can do something about gun laws today and we're just not doing it."
McCarthy may get some limited help from the feds at least in keeping repeat criminals off the street: the office of newly appointed U.S. Attorney Zachary Fardon announced Monday the creation of a violent crimes section to focus on how to more effectively use federal statues to prosecute those behind Chicago's gun violence, the Chicago Tribune reported.
"The media, they keep talking about the rising toll of gun violence in Chicago while the numbers are going in the other direction," McCarthy said last year.
