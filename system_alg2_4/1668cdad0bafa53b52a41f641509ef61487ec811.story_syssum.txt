(CNN) -- Pakistan wrapped up a first series whitewash over top-ranked England on Monday by winning the third and final Test in Dubai by 71 runs, making history in the process.
However, the batsmen continued their poor tour and collapsed to 252 all out as in-form spinner Saeed Ajmal and fast bowler Umar Gul took four wickets each.
England captain Andrew Strauss said the defeat should serve as a warning ahead of a two-match series with Sri Lanka, which starts at the end of March.
We've got a lot of cricket coming up.
I've got to try be ready for the Sri Lanka series."
It capped a disappointing series for Pietersen, Bell and Morgan, who scored less than 200 runs between them in the three matches.
Graeme Swann (1) fell to Gul soon after and Ajmal ended a stubborn ninth-wicket partnership of 34 when he had James Anderson caught at slip for nine.
