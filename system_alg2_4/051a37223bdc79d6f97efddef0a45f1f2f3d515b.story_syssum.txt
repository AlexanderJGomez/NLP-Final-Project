The company described the "sophisticated attack" in a blog post on Friday, saying it took place in January when a small number of employees visited a compromised website that installed malware on their machines.
It is clear that others were attacked and infiltrated recently as well," said the blog post.
Unlike Twitter, Facebook said it has found no evidence that any user information was compromised.
Facebook said the site responsible for its attack took advantage of a previously unknown Java vulnerability, which Oracle patched on February 1.
Facebook said it will continue to work with law enforcement and others in the industry to prevent future attacks.
