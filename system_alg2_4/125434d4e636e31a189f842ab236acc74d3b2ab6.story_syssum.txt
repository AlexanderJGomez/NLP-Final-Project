(CNN) -- Bea Arthur, the actress best known for her roles as television's "Maude" and the sardonic Dorothy on "The Golden Girls," has died of cancer, a family spokesman said Saturday.
Arthur's opinionated Maude first appeared on Norman Lear's "All in the Family" as Edith Bunker's cousin, and was so popular that Lear created a spin-off series.
But many saw Maude as an enduring icon for women's liberation -- a big deal for the shy, Jewish girl born Bernice Frankel in New York City.
The young Bea Arthur earned a living singing and doing stage work on Broadway and off-Broadway.
Arthur left "Maude" in 1978, making television and some film appearances afterward.
The role earned Arthur a second Emmy -- the first was for "Maude."
White, McClanahan and Getty continued for another season on the show, renamed "The Golden Palace," but the show lasted only one season without Arthur.
Her last television appearance was on "The View" in 2007.
