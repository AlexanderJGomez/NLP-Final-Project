ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The Bartendaz of New York want to serve as many young people as possible -- and that's a good thing.
By ditching free weights and weight machines in favor of using their own body weight on the bar and the floor, the Bartendaz have developed a series of acrobatic strength exercises that have sparked attention on YouTube and from such celebrity clients as rapper Ludacris and mixed martial arts champion Rashad Evans.
Dozens of New York City schools have adopted Bartendaz moves into their physical education programs through grass-roots networking, Yasin said.
And the use of body weight, instead of free weights, keeps it safe for young bodies, said Dr. Stephen Sanders, the director of the School of Physical Education and Exercise Science at the University of South Florida.
The Bartendaz have also found success teaching juvenile and adult inmates at Rikers Island, the New York jail facility -- an idea met with resistance about five years ago.
" Yasin said, quoting early critics.
Once we presented it, that was it.
And now I can get out of my cell,' " Yasin said.
Having built up respect from teachers and administrators at New York City schools, Yasin and his team were tasked with developing a program to get kids to stop cutting gym class.
said Dr. G (short for Dr. Goodbody), one of the Bartendaz whom Yasin consulted in developing the school initiative.
Exercising at the pull-up bar brings a camaraderie that you don't see among weight lifters, Yasin said.
Crossroads South PE teacher Rachelle Bradley said she hoped to work further with the Bartendaz to incorporate their moves into her teaching.
... Our students don't like structure, and this is more creative," Bradley said.
"I love when I'm challenged because ... it keeps me on top of my game."
