(CNN) -- The prominent man had an altercation with his wife at a hotel.
A plea deal so generous that the abuser's arrest record will be expunged -- totally clean, as if the whole thing had never happened -- if he receives some counseling in the next few months.
The woman identified as Kelli Fuller said her drunk husband was assaulting her.
About a minute into the call, as dispatchers summon help, Kelli Fuller is heard saying "I hate you, I hate you."
Then, Fuller will have to undergo a once-a-week family and domestic violence program for 24 weeks.
As Fuller put it, "I also look forward to ... returning to full, active status in the Middle District of Alabama."
The parallels between the Rice and Fuller cases extend further.
After Ray beat his then-fiancee, Janay Palmer, unconscious in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the couple married.
Consider that last line: "my family, where they should be resolved."
In cases of domestic violence, the question is often raised whether the victim will "press charges."
Whether the Rices and Fullers stay married is their business; but whether Ray Rice and Judge Mark Fuller committed crimes should be a question for prosecutors, and ultimately, juries to decide.
All the rest of us can do is hope that the next prominent man who beats up his wife doesn't get off as easy.
