Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea's new defense minister said his country would respond with airstrikes if North Korea attacks it again, South Korean state media reported Friday.
"If the North commits any additional provocations against the South, we will make sure that it pays a dear price without fail," he said in a nationally televised address Monday.
The attack killed four South Koreans -- two civilians and two military personnel -- and the South returned fire.
The North accused the South of provoking the attack because shells from a South Korean military drill landed in the North's territorial waters along the region's tense maritime border in the Yellow Sea.
Meanwhile Friday, the South made preparations to begin new live-fire drills along five islands in the Yellow Sea -- including Yeonpyeong -- in an effort to deter future provocations from the North, Yonhap reported.
One Joint Chiefs of Staff official was quoted by Yonhap as saying the South hopes to resume the drills "as soon as possible."
