(CNN) -- A Texas woman vanished without a trace after visiting friends in Plano over Labor Day weekend, police said.
Morris was last seen by a friend, who walked her to a parking garage at the Shops at Legacy mall just before 4 a.m., but he did not walk her all the way to her car, police said.
"I'm not leaving.
Family and friends on Friday night also retraced Morris' steps, hoping to find answers to her whereabouts, the station said.
"I'm worried sick and will do anything to get any information on the last time anyone has seen or talked to her please help and pray that she is ok," he said in a posting Tuesday.
Anyone with information is asked to call police at 972-424-5678.
