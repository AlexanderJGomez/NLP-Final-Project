(CNN) -- Spain striker Fernando Torres may not be fit for the start of the World Cup, according to his English club Liverpool.
He told Liverpool's official Web site: "You can't be absolutely certain of anything but at this stage, if he continues to progress the way he is, he should be fit to play at some stage during the World Cup.
Adler has been told he needs surgery on a rib injury, aggravated while playing for his club Bayer Leverkusen during their weekend German Bundesliga draw with Hertha Berlin.
Rolfes, who also plays for Leverkusen, has been out of action since an operation on a knee injury back in January and will not be adding to his 21 caps at the finals in South Africa.
Meanwhile, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy has been left out of Holland's provisional World Cup squad, but coach Bert Van Marwijk says it doesn't necessarily spell the end of his World Cup dream.
The 33-year-old former Manchester United and Real Madrid forward is currently playing for Hamburg in the Bundesliga.
