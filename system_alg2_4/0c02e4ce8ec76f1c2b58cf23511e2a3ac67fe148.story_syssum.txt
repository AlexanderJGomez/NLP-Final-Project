Discovery Channel shark expert Jeff Kurr calls it a great white shark, but shark expert David Shiffman believes it was a dolphin.
Shiffman, a recognized shark expert, noted in a Facebook posting that "the tail is flat," like a dolphin, and unlike a shark.
"Plus, the fact that that particular beach has become the epicenter for white shark activity, I would say it's definitely a white shark."
There are plenty of great white sharks in the southern California surf, but they pose no danger to beachgoers, according to Randy Hamilton, a shark expert with California's Monterey Bay Aquarium.
When the sharks approach adulthood, they relocate to the cooler waters near San Francisco where they change their diets to mammals -- sea lions and seals, he said.
