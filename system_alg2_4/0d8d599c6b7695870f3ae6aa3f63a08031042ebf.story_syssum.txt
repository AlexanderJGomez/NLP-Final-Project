The captain of a ship at sea is one of the last bastions of total authority in this world.
In the case of a cruise ship, thousands of passengers have come aboard with the expectation that they are in the hands of a competent crew headed by a competent captain.
He is given extraordinary training for the challenges of the waters he is in and the vessel he is commanding.

Given these serial failures of responsibility, the one blessing is that the accident occurred so close to shore, which allowed so many of the passengers to reach safety on their own.
But even before it gets under way, one thing is clear: the training and promotion process that put a man like this in command of a passenger ship missed the character flaw that allowed him to jeopardize his vessel for some apparently transient and empty purpose.
He has been called a hero in the Italian press, but rejects the moniker.
I just did my duty, the duty of a sea captain," he said.
