Ballet dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko, often cast as the villain in Bolshoi Ballet productions, is now the lead defendant in a plot worthy of a Tchaikovsky score.
Two alleged co-conspirators have been detained: Alleged hit man Yuri Zarutsky -- a burly, bearded Russian who was previously convicted of beating someone to death -- and Andrey Lipatov, who allegedly drove the getaway car after Zarutksy's battery acid attack on Filin.
Filin, 42, was promoted to the Bolshoi Theatre's coveted post in March 2011, shortly after the deputy ballet director, Gennady Yanin, who was widely seen as a favorite for the artistic director post, resigned when pornographic pictures of him surfaced online.
Tsiskaridze, incidentally, was also a contender for the artistic director job that Filin got.
RIA Novosti reported that before the attack, Filin suffered months of intimidation, including threatening phone calls.
Dmitrichenko, who studied Filin's schedule, called Lipatov and Zarutsky when he saw Filin leave the theater on the cold night of January 17, police said.
"I didn't see what happened there," Lipatov told them in a video released by police.
It may take at least six months for Filin to recover from the burns.
She says she's going to follow Filin's plans and she believes the dancers will now be united by greater respect and care for each other.
