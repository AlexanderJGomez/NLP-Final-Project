Joining the ranks of thousands of companies, restaurants, schools, average Americans and Oprah, a recent newsletter from the USDA made a humble suggestion for its employees to reduce their environmental footprints: Consider eating a meat-free lunch once per week.
But the rationale behind an idea like "Meatless Monday" is crystal clear.
Cattle farming alone consumes nearly 8% of global human water use.
My own organization, Oxfam, an international relief and development organization, recently endorsed the idea of eating less meat and dairy as part of our GROW campaign to fight global hunger.
Eating less meat is a simple way to reduce the pressure on global resources and help ensure that everyone has enough to eat.
Swapping out meat just once per week would also help reduce the emissions that are contributing to climate change and extreme weather.
Our study looked at what would happen if urban and suburban households in just four countries -- the United States, United Kingdom, Spain and Brazil -- decided to swap beef for lentils just once a week.
Sadly, facts like these are not enough to avoid the silly season altogether, or to persuade the USDA to ignore the self-serving indignation of the meat industry and keep a reasonable suggestion on its site.
