(CNN)Andrew Brannan, 66, who is scheduled to be put to death this week for the murder of a 22-year-old Georgia sheriff's deputy in 1998, is hoping his sentence will be found uniquely unconstitutional.
The killing of Laurens County Deputy Kyle Dinkheller was captured on the deputy's dash camera just outside Dublin, Georgia.
Brannan then yells that he is a Vietnam veteran.
Brannan's car door window shatters above his head.
But Brannan is able to advance on the deputy, and off camera, you hear the deputy scream before Brannan repeatedly shoots Dinkheller and then flees the scene.
Nothing will ever bring my son back, but finally some justice for the one who took him from his children and his family."
