On Monday, Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler said he will seek the death penalty in the case despite a defense request to take capital punishment off the table if Holmes pleaded guilty.
Deciding whether to pursue the death penalty was a delicate balancing act for the state, said CNN legal contributor Paul Callan.
But even if Holmes is sentenced to death, there are no guarantees.
The death penalty was reinstated in Colorado in 1976.

In deciding to seek the death penalty, prosecutors also had to weigh the impact on the families of the victims since the case could go on for a year, with a string of appeals likely.
"Prior to arraignment, Mr. Holmes made an offer to the prosecution to resolve this case by pleading guilty and spending the rest of his life in prison, without any opportunity for parole," the documents filed by the defense team read.
Witnesses who spoke to CNN said the gunman roamed the theater, shooting randomly as people tried to scramble away or cowered between seats.
"This is not a 'whodunit.'
