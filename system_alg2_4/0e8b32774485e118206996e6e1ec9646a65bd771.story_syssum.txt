(CNN)The former Navy SEAL who says he fired the shot that killed Osama bin Laden says he doesn't care if people believe him.
The killing of bin Laden will go down in history, O'Neill said.
The audio interview follows an interview published this week in The Washington Post, in which O'Neill publicly identified himself as the SEAL who killed the leader of al Qaeda in 2011.
O'Neill, who had been serving as a SEAL for 15 years at the time of the bin Laden raid, had participated in other missions, but he said he feared this mission would be his most difficult.
So we would talk about this," O'Neill said.
And that's closure," he said in the audio interview.

In the audio interview, O'Neill says he believes some details about the bin Laden mission, such as how he was killed, were no longer classified because they had been repeatedly leaked in the aftermath by high-level officials.
The Shooter said the al Qaeda leader was standing up and had a gun "within reach," and it was only then that the Shooter fired two shots into bin Laden's forehead, killing him.
Another member of the secretive SEAL Team 6, which executed the bin Laden raid, told CNN's Peter Bergen the story of The Shooter as presented in Esquire is false.
And unfortunately for me, there was two people in the room, and one of us is dead and that's Osama bin Laden."
