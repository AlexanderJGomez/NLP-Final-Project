They are called "free" because nobody actually buys the newspapers they are reading.
Newspaper vendor John Mgbachi, a former shoemaker from Eastern Nigeria, who has a stand in Tinubu Square on Lagos Island said that far from being bad for business, he welcomes the free readers.
Some even take out a monthly subscription to read the newspapers.
Mgbachi added there has a been a sharp decline in readers because most people now read their news on the internet.
Most of Nigeria's $70 billion oil wealth is concentrated in the hands of a politically connected elite while many of its citizens struggle to make ends meet.
