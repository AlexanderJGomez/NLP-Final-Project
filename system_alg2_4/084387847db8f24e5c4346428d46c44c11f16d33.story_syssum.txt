(CNN) -- Republican Joni Ernst has won the race for Iowa's U.S. Senate seat held by retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, defeating Democratic challenger Bruce Braley, according to a CNN projection.
Ernst was a little-known Iowa state senator when she burst on the national political scene during the GOP primary, declaring in a TV ad that if elected she would cut pork spending in Washington the way she castrated pigs growing up on an Iowa farm.
The popular Harkin campaigned for Braley but couldn't make up for several gaffes and missteps the four-term lawmaker made during the campaign that surprised and disappointed his supporters in Iowa and Washington.
Braley was also criticized when it was revealed his family had filed a complaint against a neighbor whose chickens were crossing onto his property.
she said.
"I'm a bridge builder not a bridge burner," Braley said.
