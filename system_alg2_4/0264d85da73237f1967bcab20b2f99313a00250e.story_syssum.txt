North Korea and Somalia rank equal-worst of 174 countries with a score of just eight.
The Corruption Perceptions Index highlights the problems that emerging economies have with public sector corruption, misappropriation of funds and bribery, said Jose Ugaz, the chair of Transparency International, in a press release.
Xi's much-vaunted drive against the "tigers" -- high-ranking public officials -- and "flies" -- lowly apparatchiks -- has been touted as a "life or death" priority for the leader, who announced the initiative shortly after taking office in 2012.
Despite his warnings, and attempts to address the issue, the report finds that perceptions of public sector corruption in China are worsening.
"China's fight against corruption focuses on prosecution, a very top-down way of fighting corruption," he told CNN.
Transparency International says the extent of corruption within countries has an impact on their own economic growth, and there's a risk of problems being exported with trade and investment.
"The 2014 Corruption Perceptions Index shows that economic growth is undermined and efforts to stop corruption fade when leaders and high level officials abuse power to appropriate public funds for personal gain," Ugaz said in a statement.
