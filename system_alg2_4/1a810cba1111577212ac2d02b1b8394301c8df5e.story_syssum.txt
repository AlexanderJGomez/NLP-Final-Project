WASHINGTON (CNN) -- When you think of high-risk jobs, you probably do not think of judges.
Marshals Service, the number of threats against federal judges and prosecutors has mushroomed from 500 in 2003 to 1,278 in 2008.
I also received some after I issued a Second Amendment opinion," Walton says.
Marshals Service, which is responsible for the protection of federal judges, installed an elaborate camera surveillance system at Walton's house.
Marshals Service, also takes it seriously.
Fagan says the people sending the threats are "individuals frustrated with the legal system" who "feel that they have not gotten their day in court."
Fagan says the threats often escalate as a case moves through the legal system.
"If you're going to get elected and be in the rough and tough world of criminal justice, you can't be shy and you'd better have nerves of steel.
That tragic case has led to better reporting of threats against judges, according the the U.S.
But Walton has his own theory on why the volume of threats has increased.
