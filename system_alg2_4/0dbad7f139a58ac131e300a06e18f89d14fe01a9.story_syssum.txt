New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- BP has put off crucial "integrity tests" on the new stacking cap on its ruptured Gulf oil well so it can review testing procedures, a review expected to take place through the night and into Wednesday.
But throughout the evening, cameras some 5,000 feet below the surface showed oil gushing from the well's capping stack, indicating that valves had not been closed to begin the pressure tests.
When they do take place, the integrity tests will measure pressure inside the well and will last anywhere from six to 48 hours.
They will involve incrementally closing three valves on the new cap, a process that would allow BP to do its pressure measurements.
Allen was asked what he thought the odds were to the success of being able to shut the well with the new cap.
If it's determined that the cap can't seal the well completely, and some crude must be sent to the surface, the oil-gathering ship, the Helix Producer, in now in place.
Meanwhile, in another development Tuesday, the Obama administration sent BP and other responsible parties a fourth bill relating to the oil spill.
Among those costs is skimming oil on the surface of the Gulf.
But BP doesn't expect the first relief well work to be completed until August.
"There's still a significant amount of oil out there, and the oil recovery and the impacts of this oil will probably extend well into the fall in terms of oil coming ashore, tar balls, beach cleanup, and then we will be moving of course at that point of the natural resources damage assessment trying to understand the long-term environmental ecological impact of the event," Allen said.
Interior Department Monday has already played a prominent role in the hearings.
