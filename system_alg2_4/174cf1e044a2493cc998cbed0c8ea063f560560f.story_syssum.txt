Sri Lankan army chief Sarath Fonseka says a key Tamil town has been taken in a national TV broadcast Sunday.
"This is the long awaited victory and I am happy to say that our heroic forces today captured the Mullaittivu town after 12 years," the Sri Lanka Army chief said.
The rebels gained control over Mullaittivu in 1996 and established a military garrison there, according to the government.
The re-capture enabled the government to use a highway linking the mainland to the peninsula to move troops and supplies.
"This is an important strategic success for the army, but literally tens of thousands of people, children, are in the line of fire," United Nations spokesman James Elder said in a phone conversation Sunday.
"They (Sri Lankan authorities) are also directly responsible for subjecting journalists to harassment and interrogation," she said.
At least 14 journalists have been killed since the start of 2006, according to the statement.
