However, Ferguson -- whose reign ended with a 13th Premier League crown last season -- urged fans to be patient after a difficult start to this campaign.
We've always had priorities obviously, and David is aware of that, but I hope he achieves it.
Moyes, who did win the pre-season Community Shield match, was boosted ahead of the Southampton match when teen sensation Adnan Januzaj signed a new five-year contract.
Januzaj sent Wayne Rooney clear on goal and, although the England striker's shot was saved by Artur Boruc, Robin van Persie fired home from the rebound.
"We should probably have put the game to bed earlier," Moyes said.
By contrast, Arsenal romped to a comprehensive 4-1 win at home to Norwich that put Arsene Wenger's team two points clear of Chelsea and Liverpool.
However, the Cameroon striker's cheeky dispossession of David Marshall when the visiting keeper bounced the ball -- which allowed Eden Hazard to equalize with the first of his two goals -- left Cardiff boss Malky Mackay fuming.
He saw Samuel Eto'o standing next to him and he bounced the ball."
In the late match, Manchester City won away for the first time this season, beating West Ham 3-1 thanks to a double from Sergio Aguero to move above Southampton into fourth place.
