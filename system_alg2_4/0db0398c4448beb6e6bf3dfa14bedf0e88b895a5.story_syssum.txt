"I felt good once the bone was put back in," the former number one told reporters on Wednesday evening.
Woods' participation had been in serious doubt prior to his practice round, after he struggled to tie his shoes on Sunday because of pain.
"(To) try to go out there and win this event, that's all I'm focused on," said Woods, who won the PGA Championship the last time it was held at Valhalla Golf Club in 2000.
Trailing the all-time record held by Jack Nicklaus, 14-time major winner Woods needs to prove his form and fitness this week to have a hope of making Tom Watson's team for next month's Ryder Cup against Europe in Scotland.
Should he suffer no further problems, Woods will partner former champions Phil Mickelson and Padraig Harrington when he tees off on Thursday.
In a separate development on Wednesday, PGA Championship organizers announced that the 2016 edition of the competition will be held in July.
