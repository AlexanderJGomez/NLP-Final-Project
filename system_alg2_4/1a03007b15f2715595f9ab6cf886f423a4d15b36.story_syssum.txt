The State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons Report also says trafficking has increased in Africa and slaps six African nations on a blacklist of countries not meeting the minimum standard of combating trafficking.
"With this report, we hope to shine the light brightly on the scope and scale of modern slavery, so all governments can see where progress has been made and where more is needed."
African countries Nigeria and Mauritius are praised in the report for making strong efforts to combat trafficking.
Most of the countries are "source" and "destination" countries, the report says, meaning trafficking victims both come from and are sent there.
The State Department also put Malaysia in the Tier 3 list, because of its trafficking of Burmese refugees.
This year, the Justice Department also put out a report on U.S. efforts to combat trafficking efforts at home.
But that's not the case.
For the first time, she said, the United States next year will rank its own efforts at combating trafficking along with the rest of the world.
