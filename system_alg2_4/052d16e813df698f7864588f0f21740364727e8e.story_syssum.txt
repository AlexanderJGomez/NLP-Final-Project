LONDON, England (CNN) -- Scientist and author Stephen Hawking is "very ill" and has been hospitalized, according to Cambridge University, where he is a professor.
Hawking has Lou Gehrig's Disease (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or ALS), which is usually fatal after three years.
On his Web site, Hawking has written about living with ALS.
Hawking is completely dependent on others or technology for virtually everything -- bathing, dressing, eating, even speech.
In 2004, police completed an investigation into accusations by Hawking's daughter that his second wife was abusing him.
He also said if he had the choice of meeting Newton or Marilyn Monroe, his choice would be Marilyn.
The following are some quotes from that interview:
