Controversy surrounded the sale Thursday of Gandhi's items -- among them his metal-rimmed glasses, pocket watch, sandals, bowl and plate -- prompting the seller, James Otis, to ask that the items be withdrawn from the auction.
Its Ministry of External Affairs said the bidding would "commercialize and thereby demean the memory of the Father of the Nation and everything that he stood for in his life, beliefs and actions."
Still, the government had hoped Otis would not allow the public to bid on the items.
Soni, the culture minister, said that India's government exercised several options to stop the auction at the Antiquorum in New York.
He did not even have a home to live in."
