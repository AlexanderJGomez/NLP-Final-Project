"Our love for our family is boundless," the statement said.
Life is fragile.
Cadaver dogs led them to the bodies, officials said.
The house belonged to Pyle, chief operating officer for ScienceLogic, company spokesman Antonio Piraino said.
"You're looking at five standard houses put together," he said Tuesday.

Fire officials said they were alerted to the fire about 3:30 a.m. Monday.

Pyle told the newspaper he eventually moved from sales to sales management to general management positions.
