The contract agreement with the school system still needs to be ratified by the more than 29,000 teachers and support staff who are members of the union.
Chicago Public Schools, the third-largest U.S. school system, and the union struck a tentative bargain Friday afternoon.
Emanuel highlighted the fact that the new school day would be longer for many students.
Lewis told CNN's "Erin Burnett OutFront" that Emanuel had tried to bully her union members.
We still want to work with the board of education so we can accomplish what's really best for our kids."
The school board posted a notice on its website: "Chicago Teachers Union leadership has chosen to end the strike.
David Vitale, chairman of the school board, said the new deal will transform the school system to the benefit of teachers and students.
He said that teachers were frustrated with the board, whose members are appointed and most of whom came from business backgrounds.
This contract calls for longer school days for elementary and high school-age students, 10 more "instructional days" each school year and a single calendar for the entire school system, as opposed to the two schedules now in place, depending on the school.
Chicago Public Schools CEO Jean-Claude Brizard said that the schools had improved measurably in the past year in test scores.
The graduation rate was the highest and the dropout rate was the lowest in history.
