How green is your website?
Wissner-Gross estimates every second someone spends browsing a simple web site generates roughly 20 milligrams of C02.
A 2007 report from research firm Gartner, for example, estimates the manufacturing, use and disposal of information and communications technology generates about two percent of the world's greenhouse gases -- similar to the level produced by the entire aviation industry.
Anti-virus software firm McAfee reports that the electricity needed just to transmit the trillions of spam emails sent annually equals the amount required to power over two million homes in the United States while producing the same level of greenhouse gas emissions as more than three million cars.
Calculating the carbon footprint of the entire web however is not as easy as measuring the greenhouse gas emissions of a car.
The manufacturing, transport and use of personal computers and laptops also has what some say is the most significant impact, producing roughly 200 million tons of emissions in 2002.
As millions of people buy new laptops and computers every year, this figure could triple by the end of the next decade, according to the Climate Group report.
"And what that includes is the energy that we at Google use to be able to receive your search, process it and then send it back to you," Erik Teetzel, one of Google's "green" engineers, told CNN.
Netherlands-based Cleanbits lobbies web sites to go green by either by purchasing carbon offsets or switching to green hosting providers, like AISO.net, a solar-powered data center based in California.
And, like Google, Yahoo also incorporates renewable power and other efficiency measures in its data centers.
It is actually a paradigm change."
