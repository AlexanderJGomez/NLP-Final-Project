-- and still I might not quit the world's largest social network.
More than just a daily habit, Facebook has become the place where I get important, often surprising glimpses into the lives of the 1,365 people with whom I've chosen to connect.
But, in large part, the people who say they're leaving Facebook don't.
Facebook just is.
Facebook is on track to hit a billion users sometime this year.
Those who have been waiting for something else to take its place, the way Facebook siphoned off the population of MySpace about five years ago, are still waiting.
That's what Facebook wants, of course.
When my grandmother died earlier this year, it was the place my relatives posted photos of her I'd never seen before.
When Facebook recently bought photo-sharing app Instagram for $1 billion, Instagram users vowed to quit, complaining that their precious little network had sold out to a monolithic company.
Path, which has a lovely interface and is more focused on smaller circles of friends, just hit 2 million users a few months ago.
If something is ever going to take the place of Facebook once the company gets so big and complacent that it loses focus, it will probably be something built on top of Facebook.
Perhaps a mobile app that accesses the social network's huge population, something Facebook-adjacent that takes what people like about Facebook and turns it into something more nimble and attractive than Facebook itself.
