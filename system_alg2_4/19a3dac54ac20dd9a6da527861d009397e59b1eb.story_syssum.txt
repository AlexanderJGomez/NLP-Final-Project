Now the former officers and 12 others have been arrested and charged with racketeering after a four-year investigation authorities dubbed Operation Prison Cell.
The indictment released Wednesday accuses 13 former corrections officers of smuggling cell phones into the McConnell Unit Prison in Beeville, Texas, about 200 miles southwest of Houston.
This month's indictment doesn't detail how much money guards at the McConnell Unit Prison allegedly received in exchange for the cell phones.
Thirteen of the former guards arrested are charged with racketeering, and four face drug charges, Dodge said.
Now, authorities said, some of the former correction officers who once guarded the Texas prison are behind bars themselves.
