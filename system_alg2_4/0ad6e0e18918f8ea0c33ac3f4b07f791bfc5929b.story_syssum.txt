Santana recalled the moments when he recorded a roughly three-minute video of North Charleston Police officer Michael Slager shooting Walter Scott as Scott was running away Saturday.
At no time did Santana see Scott go after the Taser.
Police said Slager used a Taser against Scott, but Slager would also later tell a dispatcher that Scott at some point had grabbed the Taser.
Neither the struggle nor the use of a Taser was captured on video, because Santana had yet to begin recording.
When Santana's video begins, Scott starts running away from the officer, with Scott's back to Slager.
"He was there.
Judy Scott said she couldn't watch the whole recording.
"When I saw my son running and I saw the policeman behind him, I couldn't take it," she said.
But ... if I wouldn't show my face, everybody over there knows, including the police, who I am," Santana said.
Santana said after he stopped recording, he watched for a few more minutes but never saw anyone perform CPR.
