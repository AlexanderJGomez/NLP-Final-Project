It's that reality the country's principal opposition group says led it to suspend its participation in next week's meeting in Rome of the Friends of Syria -- an international conference of diplomats from more than 60 nations working to bring about an end to the violence.
The whole world is not doing anything," Adib Shishakly, a member of the Syrian National Coalition, told CNN on Friday.
Alawites are an offshoot of Shiite Islam.
"We want the U.S. to help the people on the ground," Shishakly said.
The news that the National Coalition was pulling out of the meeting came as a surprise to the United States where at least one senior U.S. official warned the move would be counterproductive.
The National Coalition, meanwhile, is pushing ahead with plans to create a transitional government despite al-Assad's refusal to cede power.
The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said 213 people killed in fighting across the country Friday.
Of the casualties, 92 were killed in the opposition stronghold of Aleppo, according to the group.
The United Nations recently estimated 70,000 people died in the fighting in Syria.
