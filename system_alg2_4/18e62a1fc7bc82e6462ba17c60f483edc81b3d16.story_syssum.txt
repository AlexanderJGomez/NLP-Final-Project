(Tribune Media Services) -- We don't know where to look first.
Antoni Gaudi's Sagrada Familia is Barcelona's most famous site and Spain's most visited.
(Find the fruit carved on top of the towers, the young stone musicians, the birds.)
Luckily, Gaudi had made plaster models of the church (we see them in the museum at the site) and though they were also smashed, his supporters were able to painstakingly put them back together so the work could continue.
Sometimes, you have to know when to call it quits, even at incredible sites like this one.
Unfortunately, no one in Barcelona gravitated toward the idea.
"Cool," Erica says.
Barcelona, home to the 1992 Summer Olympics, is a city that appeals to kids (especially teens) and parents.
And with such friendly locals, there's no better place for the kids to practice their Spanish.
I never saw so many different kinds of gummies than at the famous Boqueria food market, said to be the largest in Europe.
We're holing up overnight at the Hotel Arts Barcelona, a Ritz Carlton, a famous icon of the Barcelona skyline and a short walk from the beach and many of the city sites.
It's housed in three spectacular stone mansions in the historic quarter of the city and showcases works from the artist's early years, his Blue Period and early works from Barcelona.
I didn't really see evidence of that, but, after all, we were there at 8:30, early by Barcelona standards.
The bull, of course, is the national symbol of Spain.
We are in Barcelona after all.
Erica unfortunately isn't.
"I just won't eat," says Erica, after perusing the menu.
