This seems unremarkable today other than the fact that strong women were not exactly well-supported in those days in the music business.
As in other professions when a female artist was successful, she was often accused of being demanding and diva-like even when all she sought was the same respect or artistic license that men of their stature received.
As with many famous people, the celebrity she achieved came with public attention beyond imagination -- and some of it wasn't always very kind.
Her ballads were attacked for lacking rhythm.
At the same time, the adulation of her fans around the world was huge.
Of course, I don't know what drove her to drugs in the beginning, but drowning out the intensity around her was surely one of the side effects she came to depend upon.
And of course, then there is addiction.
Like Billie Holiday, Judy Garland, Elvis and others before her, that inner voice of doubt that we all feel sometimes just could never keep up with the public adulation.
That says so much about her determination to beat her addiction.
