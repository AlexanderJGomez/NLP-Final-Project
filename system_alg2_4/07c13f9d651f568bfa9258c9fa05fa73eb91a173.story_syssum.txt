The "clash of civilizations" has become a popularized frame that is wheeled out whenever an attack by Islamic extremists is carried out against a Western target.
According to this narrative, the West, which treasures freedom of speech, has this week come under attack from an Islamic culture that refuses to accept any instance of what it regards as blasphemy.
Separately, the liberal British journalist Jon Snow tweeted: "Paris: brutal clash of civilizations: Europe's belief in freedom of expression vs those for whom death is a weapon in defending their beliefs."
Clearly Europe and North America enjoy a high degree of freedom of expression.
In states such as Bahrain and Egypt, those expressing unacceptable opinions can find themselves jailed, tortured, and even massacred, while the governments of the United States and United Kingdom continue to arm the regimes responsible.
Similarly, if democracy and freedom of speech are antithetical to the values of Arab or Muslim culture, then how to explain the thousands, even millions of people in the Middle East that have, especially since late 2010, fought and risked their lives for precisely these things, often against regimes backed by Western states?
The degree of freedom secured at any given moment merely reflects how the struggle between the two sides has played out so far, rather than some innate cultural attributes.
Western state support for regimes like Saudi Arabia, and pursuit of disastrous wars, not least in Iraq, may not be the decisive causal factors.
What we need now is not false division between "East" and "West", but for democrats on both sides to stand together against extremism and violence in all its forms.
