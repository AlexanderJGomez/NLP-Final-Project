Nathaniel Nicholson, son of an infamous CIA double agent, faces his own spying charges.
The elder Nicholson pleaded guilty in 1997 to spying for Russia and is the highest ranking CIA officer ever to be sentenced for espionage.
At his father's request, Nathaniel Nicholson allegedly shared the money with his sister and grandparents.
Jim Nicholson told his son that his alleged spying activities "were 'risky' but not 'illegal,'" the indictment said.
If convicted, Jim and Nathaniel Nicholson could face up to 20 years in jail.
