New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- My dad died when I was 2, so my mother raised us [Smith and his sister] and exposed us to different things.
My mom was a very good cook.
On holidays, we would go to work with her.
I started baking.
I might have looked at other recipes and didn't think we had the ingredients, and I certainly didn't have money to go buy them.
We went to Mass once a week, while in school, as well as on Sundays.
I've certainly called on God when I'm in the kitchen, when things are going wrong, when I'm irritated or very upset about something.
It was something I was going to do out of high school, and I put it off.
I didn't wake up one morning and just sit up in bed and stretch and say, "Well, I think I'll try the priesthood."
I have a spiritual director I work with, and I started out with that at first.
I will miss the people.
The cooking aspects, I definitely will miss.
I would love to do something for the needy or poor, during the holidays when people really feel their lowest.
I want to give all of myself, and I don't think you can do that when you have a lot of baggage.
I want to donate it to a school.
The prayer life, the rules that a priest is supposed to live by, that really excites me.
I want to emulate her, and I think this is the best way that I can see for me.
