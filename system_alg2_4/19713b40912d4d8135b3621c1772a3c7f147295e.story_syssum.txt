New Delhi (CNN) -- India's ruling Congress party has suffered a crushing defeat in local elections that are considered a litmus test for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government.
His party is believed to have a strong base among Hindu middle castes and Muslims.
The outcome is a personal setback for star campaigner Rahul Gandhi, who struggled hard to revive the Congress party.
Though the state is almost paralyzed by widespread poverty and poor health care, political observers say caste and religion still take precedence over development in local politics.
The ousted leader, Mayawati, became chief minister of Uttar Pradesh in 2007 after leading her Bahujan Samaj Party to an overwhelming victory in this state of more than 200 million people.
An influential local leader, Okram Ibobi Singh, was credited for retaining power for the Congress party in the far-flung, insurgency-wracked Manipur province.
