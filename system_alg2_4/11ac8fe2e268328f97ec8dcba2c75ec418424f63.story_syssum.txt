(CNN) -- Alexis Sanchez sealed Barcelona's victory in last weekend's El Clasico with an impudent goal and Friday gave them a hard won victory over Espanyol in the Catalan derby.
Even with this comparative drought, Barcelona have forged four points clear of Atletico Madrid, who have a game in hand, and nine in front of Real Madrid, beaten 2-0 last Saturday.
Stuttgart had been unbeaten in seven league matches and took the lead through Tunisian defender Karim Haggui.
It left Juergen Klopp's men two points clear of champions Bayern, who play at Hoffenheim Saturday.
