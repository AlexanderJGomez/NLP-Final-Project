If a new president comes to the White House -- if Romney and Ryan win -- will America find itself once again at war?
President George W. Bush did not expect 9/11 (crazy conspiracy theories aside), just as Obama had no idea that the Arab uprisings would transform a key region of the world and test his skill in a series of conflicts, some of which confronted America's values against its alliances.
A look at how Romney and Ryan would respond to the challenges facing America is as revealing as it is stunning.
That was in 2009.
In a speech last year, Ryan waxed idealistic about America, talking about the need for "energetic" American leadership, about the "fundamental desire for liberty" in all human beings and the need to promote our "moral principles."
Ryan, who has no foreign policy experience and has spoken little of it, outlined the dilemma facing the U.S. when he spoke about the Arab uprisings.
Regarding Afghanistan, the war in which Americans are serving and dying, Romney and Obama have, incredibly, largely avoided the topic.
And despite criticism of Obama's approach to Israel, Romney agrees with Obama that Israel is a key ally whose security is one of the non-negotiable aspects of U.S. foreign policy.
Obama went even further, saying "Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel and it must remain undivided."
To be sure, rhetoric and images matter a lot.
That China "pivot," by the way, is shared with the Obama administration.
But Obama may do just the same.
