Roland Mohler was on duty when Missouri State Highway Patrol officers arrested him, Allred said.
Burrell Mohler Sr., David Mohler and Jared Mohler are lay ministers in the Community of Christ, the organization said.
Burrell Mohler Sr. did go through the group's registered youth worker program, but "his youth worker registration has been terminated and we understand he had no contact with children or youth in church programs," the church said.
The Community of Christ is an offshoot of the modern-day Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
"I personally feel grief for these families, all the families that are involved in this," Booth said.
