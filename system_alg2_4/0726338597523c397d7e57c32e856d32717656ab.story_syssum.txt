Brad Pitt talks about "soul mate" Angelina Jolie, life, and fatherhood in Parade magazine.
"Then I got bored.
"This family is full of life," Pitt said.
Pitt said his life is very different now that he is a dad.
"When someone asked me why Angie and I don't get married, I replied, 'Maybe we'll get married when it's legal for everyone else,' " he said.
Pitt told Parade he takes exception to anyone trying to dictate how someone should live and who they should love.
People should be able to be happy, Pitt said, and that includes his children.
No, not one bit," he said.
I hope I teach my kids to be who they really are."
