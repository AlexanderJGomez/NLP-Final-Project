After breaking out of the hospital it went into a cinema and later also entered an apartment block.
"It got agitated and escaped," Sharma said.
No sightings were confirmed on Monday and Sushant did not rule out the possibility the leopard had retreated into the forests.
The incident is the latest in a series of big cat attacks in India, including at least one alleged man-eater, also in Uttar Pradesh, home to one of the world's last remaining tiger habitats.
"There are many cases where human habitats are encroaching on those of big cats, which are getting lesser and lesser over the years," said Jimmy Borah, Tiger Coordinator for the World Wildlife Fund India.
"It is possible that the tiger came out (of her habitat) looking for food and the humans accidentally came out in front of the tigers, which would mean she would be bound to kill them.
However, he agreed that if a particular animal was positively identified as one responsible for human deaths, "then one option is taking her out."
