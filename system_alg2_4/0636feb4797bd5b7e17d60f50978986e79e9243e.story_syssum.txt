Washington (CNN) -- The National Transportation Safety Board has concluded a deadly accident involving a bus driver who fell asleep while driving on a Virginia interstate last year was caused in part by "acute sleep loss" as well as inadequate oversight by the bus company and the government.
The driver, Kin Yiu Cheung, was slightly injured and refused medical treatment, safety officials said.
An examination of the driver's work schedule, sleep times and cell phone use revealed that his opportunity for sleep in the 72 hours prior to the crash was limited, the safety board said in a release.
It is also why our agency shut down 54 unsafe bus companies in 2011."
