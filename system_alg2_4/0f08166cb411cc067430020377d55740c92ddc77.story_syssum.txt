"It's horrible, because Lindsay Lohan or any defendant should be able to feel that their privacy is being protected," Heller told CNN on Wednesday after TMZ reported Lohan would check into the Seafield Center in Westhampton Beach, New York, for her court-mandated 90 days of substance abuse rehabilitation next month.
"Since I'm the only one who communicated that, it more or less would have to be that one of the two prosecutors would be their source," he said.
"It shocks me that I learn about what's going on in this case from the Internet more quickly than I do from the prosecutors," Heller said.
Santa Monica police are investigating Heller for suspicion of asking Lohan's personal assistant, who was in the car with the actress when she was involved in a car crash last June, to lie in his testimony by saying he had control of the Porsche when it crashed into a dump truck, a source close to the investigation told CNN last month.
"I can sum it up in one word: ridiculous," Heller said when asked for a comment last month.
"I think this is an opportunity for me to focus on what I love in life," she said.
