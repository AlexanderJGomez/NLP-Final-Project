The commanders said they have no reason to believe Gadhafi can exercise command and control of those militia members who remain loyal to him, the official said.
Complicating the matter was the resignation Friday of Mahdi al-Harati, the deputy head of the Tripoli Military Council, a senior National Transitional Council official said.
"There is overlapping in the role of the Tripoli military council and the NTC," he said.
Early Friday, hundreds of revolutionary fighters attacked from the west, NTC military field commanders said.
The International Committee of the Red Cross evacuated three wounded people from Ibn Sina hospital in Sirte to a field hospital on Thursday.
More than 18,000 people, including many women, children and elderly people, are displaced east of Sirte and hundreds have moved to safer locations west of the city, the Red Cross said.
The council's leader and the interim prime minister have promised to step down to clear the way for a new government once Sirte is taken.
