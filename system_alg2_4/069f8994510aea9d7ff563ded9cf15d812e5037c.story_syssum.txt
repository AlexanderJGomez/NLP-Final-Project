Make no mistake: Hardcore gaming enthusiasts do demand more value and substance from their titles than casual gamers.
Instead of piling on pointless game variants or needlessly complicated controls, the most popular mass-appeal games often focus on executing a few simple features well -- and presenting them in endlessly novel contexts.
Freeform missions, jaw-dropping graphics and extensive online multiplayer support make excellent window dressing.
