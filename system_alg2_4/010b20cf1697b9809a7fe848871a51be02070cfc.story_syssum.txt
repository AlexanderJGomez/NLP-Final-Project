(CNN) -- Bristol County, Massachusetts, prosecutors have dropped charges against an 18-year-old man accused of raping a 17-year-old girl in July at a Keith Urban concert south of Boston.
"Put simply, this was a consensual act, not a sexual assault," lawyer Steven Brooks said at the time.
"Mr. Murphy deeply regrets this incident and I am sure the young woman does as well.
"Police dealt with a steady stream of intoxicated persons as well, resulting in over 50 people being taken into protective custody and a number of others arrested for alcohol-related issues."
