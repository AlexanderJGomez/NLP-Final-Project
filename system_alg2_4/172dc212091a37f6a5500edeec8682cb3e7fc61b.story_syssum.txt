London, England (CNN) -- Police in London have reached a settlement with the family of Jean Charles de Menezes, whom officers shot dead in 2005, mistaking him for a suicide bomber.
Jurors at a 2008 inquest found that the police who shot de Menezes did not shout a warning before firing at him.
They returned an open verdict in the case, meaning the jury was unable to establish a cause of death.
De Menezes was killed July 22, 2005, a day after four failed bombings aboard the London transit system.
"I am sorry."
The shooting was one of several issues that led to the resignation last year of Police Commissioner Ian Blair.
