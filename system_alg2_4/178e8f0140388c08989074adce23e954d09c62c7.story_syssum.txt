(WIRED) -- Facebook has rolled out its new Timeline feature to the masses.
1.
To hide a Timeline element, click the pencil icon at the top of the offending post, then choose "Hide from Timeline."
If you prefer to keep your profile public, but don't want everyone to see what you posted back in high school, for example, you can also tweak your Timeline settings more generally.
2.
These events aren't listed on your Timeline, but they can be.
3.
First, you can add a cover to your Timeline.
If you set a cover photo and then decide it's not as great as you first thought, just hover your mouse over the image, and a "Change Cover" option menu will pop up, letting you reposition the image or select a new one.
4.
On your Timeline, click "Activity Log."
You can choose to see only your posts, posts by others, posts from specific Facebook apps ("Hmm, let's look at my past Farmville accomplishments"), photos and more.
5.
You can change it to "Only Important" updates or "All updates," and you can also filter what types of posts you're interested in seeing: things like life events, status updates, or photos.
You can click "More" next to Lists to add other lists of your choosing â€” "Acquaintances," "Poker Club Members," you get the picture.
Go to your friend's profile, and the Poke option is listed under a gear cog dropdown menu next to "Message."
