A third major title of his fledgling career means the Northern Irishman is just a green jacket away from a career grand slam.
"My mum, she hadn't been to the previous two majors that I won, and it was incredible the first person that greeted me coming off the 18th was her.
McIlroy's Open victory was markedly different to his previous two major wins.
But his links game, tweaked and perfected on the courses of his native Northern Ireland in the weeks leading up to the tournament, remained steadfast.
"Winning The Open, the home major for guys like myself, it's a very special championship and I'm so very honored to have won it," he explained.
"Again this feels a bit more like the first one at Congressional where I maybe had to silence a few doubters about how I played links golf, how can I handle a lead, how do I play well on a Friday.
In 2011, as a 21-year-old, McIlroy led by four shots going into the final round, and disintegrated on the back nine, eventually finishing in a tie for 15th.
"I'll be going with a lot of motivation, I'll do everything I can to prepare the best way I can because it'll be a great chance for me to put that little milestone in my career to bed and go forward.
"That boys championship was 2003 -- a lot can happen in 11 years that's for sure," he said.
"It's a great golf course, a very fair golf course I feel, and if you play well you are rewarded.
"I think you need experiences like the one in 2010, having the first round lead and losing it," he said.
I did.
I had the win earlier in the year at Wentworth and I felt like my game was just coming into form.
