The 49-year-old leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party is a former journalist and talk show host, son of a prominent politician, and a one-time amateur boxer with a rep as one of Israel's sexiest men.
Members of Yesh Atid range across the spectrum, Lapid said after the election in Tel Aviv.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains the front runner to be prime minister, with exit polls reporting his rightist Likud-Beitenu party gaining 31 seats in the 120-seat Knesset.
Lapid's party gained at least 19 seats, onetime powerhouse Labor, 15, former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni's Hatnua, 6, and leftwing Meretz, 6.
But in interviews, Lapid has proposed Israel should give up much of the West Bank -- while retaining control of Jersualem.
Yair Lapid is the son of the late politician Tommy Lapid, whose one-time anti-religious party Shinui battled the power and influence of the ultra-Orthodox.
But he used diplomatic language and persuasion in an effort to forge partnerships and policies with religionists.
One of the leaders is Rabbi Dov Lipman, a confidant of Lapid and an American immigrant to Israel.
"I think Part 1 he's really done.
He's really doing that.
Yossi Klein Halevi, a noted Israeli author, wrote an essay Wednesday in Tablet, an online magazine about Jewish issues.
Today's Likud appears more hospitable to the far rightist Moshe Feiglin than to centrists like Dan Meridor, denied a safe seat in the Likud primaries," Halevi wrote.
He emerged as the voice of middle class disaffection, yet included in his list two Ethopians, representatives of one of the country's poorest constituencies."
Yair conveys the impression of a man comfortable in all parts of Israel," Halevi wrote.
