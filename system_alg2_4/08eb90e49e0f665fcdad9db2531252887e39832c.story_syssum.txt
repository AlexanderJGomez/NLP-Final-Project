The main "downs" of buying a used car are that it's a used car, not new -- so there's no new car warranty and you are more vulnerable to used car problems that could cost you money, as well as aggravation.
Check into Certified, Pre-Owned (CPO) vehicles: These are late model used cars and trucks that typically have less than 50,000 miles and have been given multipoint inspections -- with any needed service or upkeep taken care of before the used car is put on the lot.
CPO used cars are usually clean and well-maintained -- the "cream puffs" of the used car market.
You can bet if the car has a history of problems, there will be complaints all over the Internet.
Have a third-party mechanic (not one working for the dealer) look the used car over as a condition of sale.
If the used car records are not available, you should be suspicious.

Toyota Corolla -- The gold standard of new economy cars is also, predictably, an excellent choice in a used car.
Lexus LS400/LS430 -- New, these large rear-drive, V-8 powered luxury sedans cost tens of thousands less than an equivalent Mercedes-Benz, BMW or Jaguar.
Acura RL -- A conservatively elegant large luxury car that, like the Lexus LS, enjoys a reputation for absolutely superb engineering and quality.
These are also the only late model sedans that offer standard V-8 power and rear-wheel-drive in a full-size chassis for the price of a V-6 powered, front-drive, midsize sedan.
Look for used 4x4 models with manual locking hubs.
Though it requires the driver to stop the vehicle, get out and manually engage the front hubs by rotating a knob in the center of each front wheel, these 4x4 systems tend to be more durable and problem-free in the long haul than the electronic/automatic hubs used on most new pickups.
Excellent used car resale value and top of its class occupant protection are additional reasons to consider an Odyssey.
