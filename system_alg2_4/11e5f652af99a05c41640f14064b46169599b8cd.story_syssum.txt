A portrait of Alan Turing is currently on display at the National Portrait Gallery's "Gay Icons" exhibition.
But Turing is clearly someone of international stature," Graham-Cumming said.
He was injected with estrogen, an experience that is widely believed to have led to his suicide just two years later.
Graham-Cumming has not yet received a response from the British government to his request for an apology, nor has he received a reply from Queen Elizabeth II to whom he wrote last week asking that Turing be considered for a posthumous knighthood.
Graham-Cumming is not fazed.
A portrait of Turing is currently on display at the National Portrait Gallery in London, as part of its "Gay Icons" exhibition.
He was one of the six personal icons selected by contributor Chris Smith, Britain's first openly gay Member of Parliament.
