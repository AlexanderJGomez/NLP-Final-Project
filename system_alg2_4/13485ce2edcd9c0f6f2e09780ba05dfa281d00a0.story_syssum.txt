You eat too much sugar.
We're talking about added sugar here, the sugar in processed and manufactured foods -- sugary drinks, sodas and juices, cakes and cookies, candy, processed cereals, salad dressings and breads.
Most adults in the study, which looked at average adult sugar consumption between 2005 and 2010, ate or drank more than 10% of their total calories in added sugar.
The Institute of Medicine says that our daily sugar intake should not be more than 25% of total calories consumed.
Using this model, let's go back and take a look at your daily food intake.
As a doctor, I see the consequences of excessive sugar intake every day.
They are starting too early down the wrong, deadly path.
In the study, those who consumed approximately 17% to 21% of calories from added sugar had a 38% higher risk of cardiovascular disease mortality  -- that means death because of heart or blood vessel failure -- than those who consumed approximately 8% of calories from added sugar.
This is a wake-up call.
Limit your intake of soda and other sugary drinks such as fruit juices.
Look for yourself to see how much sugar is in the foods that you are eating.
