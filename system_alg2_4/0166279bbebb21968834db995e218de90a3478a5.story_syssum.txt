(CNN) -- South African police are investigating abuse allegations at the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy, the talk-show host's $40 million school for disadvantaged girls near Johannesburg.
The newspaper said one of the pupils ran away from the school, blaming the alleged abuse.
I'm so sorry," she said tearfully, according to numerous South African media reports.
In the statement, Samuel said South African child protection services were notified and that the dorm parent was removed from the campus.
In an October 23 statement, Samuel referred inquiries to the South African Child Protection Services Unit.
