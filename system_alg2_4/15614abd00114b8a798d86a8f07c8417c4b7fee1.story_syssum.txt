Hadi has been Yemen's acting president since June 3, when President Ali Abdullah Saleh was wounded in an attack on the mosque at the presidential palace.
Hadi said he saw Saleh immediately after the bomb attack.
He acknowledges that his house is surrounded by opposing forces, but he challenges claims that he is unable to use the presidential palace.
Hadi said the new deal would have Saleh stepping down only when a new president has been elected, a far cry from the Gulf Council proposal that would have Saleh handing power to Hadi after 30 days with new elections within 60 days.
When asked how al Qaeda may have been taking advantage of deteriorating security, Hadi said government forces were targeting them aggressively.
Hadi said there are two types of drones.
Saleh went to Saudi Arabia for treatment after doctors examined him shortly after the attack in early June.
Since arriving there, he said, the president had been improving and fully intends to return.

"Al Qaeda, the federated group that's in Yemen, is an incredibly dangerous group that has taken full advantage of the chaos that has been in that country," he told the National Press Club.
