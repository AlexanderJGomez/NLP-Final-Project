(CNN) -- U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and Defense Secretary Robert Gates helped usher in the next chapter for the United States in Iraq on Wednesday, presiding over a ceremony launching a new military operation designed to train, assist and advise the Iraqis.
"Our fighting men and women were given a mission in Iraq that was as complicated as any in our history, an assignment that taught us that war is the realm of uncertainty," he said.
Odierno, who said Iraqi security forces are ready to take the lead there, recalled the wartime period as one of Iraqi heroism.
"It is time for Iraq to move forward," Odierno said.
Odierno said a democratic Iraq "can become an engine for peace and stability" in the Middle East.
While the U.S. combat mission is ending, roughly 50,000 American troops will remain in the country until the end of 2011 for the assistance mission.
The U.S. combat mission in Iraq officially ended at 5 p.m.
On Tuesday night, U.S. President Barack Obama addressed Americans about the transition in a televised speech.
The war in Iraq has claimed the lives of more than 4,400 U.S. troops.
"We have removed nearly 100,000 U.S. troops from Iraq.
Before Obama's speech, some Republicans had urged him to acknowledge that the 2007 U.S. troop surge in Iraq ordered by then-President George W. Bush had worked.
"You might recall that the surge wasn't very popular when it was announced," McConnell said.
