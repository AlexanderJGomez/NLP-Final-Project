(CNN) -- 2013 will be a year of harsh change for the tech industry.

The PC era is over, and Microsoft has to show consumers it has something to offer in a world dominated by tablets and smartphones.

In the meantime, archrival Google has begun shipping some of the best iPhone apps around -- I've replaced most of Apple's apps on my iPhone homescreen with Google-built replacements such as Gmail, Google Maps, Chrome and YouTube.

There's no way Amazon wants people searching Google to find content and products from multiple sources.

Can Google take Android back from Samsung and the wireless carriers?
Apple obviously writes its own software for the iPhone, but Samsung's phones all run a customized version of Google's open-source Android, and Samsung is so dominant that it could very well split off and start building its own version of Android, just as Amazon did with the Kindle Fire.
Companies such as AT&T and Verizon are all too happy to load up Android devices with unnecessary crapware and bloatware that ruin the user experience while delaying important software updates.
There's a happy balance between the two extremes, and Google needs to find it before Android begins to slip away entirely.
