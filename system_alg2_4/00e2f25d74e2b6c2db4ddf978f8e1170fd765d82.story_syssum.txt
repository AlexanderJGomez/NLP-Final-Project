Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Haiti's economy is getting a boost thanks to a venture with one of Korea's largest companies that promises to bring 20,000 garment industry jobs to a new industrial park in the north of the country.
"What we need is a commitment to be competitive in getting investment and putting people to work, and then we need to build the institutions that will allow the people to flower.
The garment industry had been the prime source of Haitian exports before the earthquake and it remains so today.
It also represents over 50% of the total commercial exports of Haiti," he said.
At the time, he had to ship his goods over land to the Dominican Republic before delivering them to buyers.
