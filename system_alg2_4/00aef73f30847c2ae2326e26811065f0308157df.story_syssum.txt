Workers next to the spot where subway trains will one day emerge from the tunnel.
Too bad traffic often moves at a snail's pace.
The "radical system" city planners embarked on five years ago involved construction of a new subway tunnel beneath the Bosphorus Strait, the spectacular body of water that cuts this city in two.
"We will connect two continents, Asia and Europe," said Nusret Ilbay, one of the many engineers working on the $3 billion Marmaray Tunnel Project.
"As you can see, some leakage on the wall face has been observed," Ilbay explained on a tour of the construction site.
First they dredged a trench on the bottom of the Bosphorus.
As a precaution in the event of a catastrophic flood in the tunnel, engineers constructed an emergency bunker on the bottom of the sea.
In Yenikapi, a neighborhood of textile factories and seedy hotels where one of the main transit stations for Istanbul's new subway and commuter rail system was to be built, archaeologists discovered the lost Byzantine port of Theodosius.
"At around one meter below sea level, we started finding the remains of ropes.
The scale of the excavation is unusual in modern-day archaeology, says Cemal Pulak, an anthropologist from Texas A&M University's nautical archaeology program.
The Yenikapi dig has uncovered an ancient armada: 34 Byzantine ships ranging from dating between the 7th and 11th centuries AD.
Archaeologists have nicknamed this ship "The Titanic," because it is the largest of the Theodosius wrecks.
It is the beginning of engineering.
"The first man, about 8,400 years ago, came and started to settle here," Yilmaz said.
Plans to travel beneath the Bosphorus have been delayed at least four years by the excavation of the Theodosious Port.
In the rush to move forward, the residents of Istanbul have accidentally uncovered a valuable piece of their city's ancient past.
