NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A new lawsuit alleges that convicted swindler Bernie Madoff financed a cocaine-fueled work environment and a "culture of sexual deviance," and he diverted money to his London, England, office when he believed federal authorities were closing in at home.
They also allege that major financial institutions, including KPMG, the Bank of New York and JP Morgan Chase, were aware that Madoff was transferring stolen funds to his London office for personal purchases.
According to the complaint, Madoff transferred funds to London to buy extravagant personal items.
Officials of KPMG and the Bank of New York did not immediately respond to calls from CNN Wednesday evening for comment on the lawsuit.
Madoff was fond of escorts and masseuses, and used money stolen from investors to pay them, according to the complaint.
The complaint includes details of Madoff's drastically different life now in prison.
Madoff now spends his time with infamous inmates, the lawsuit says, including Carmine Persico, a former organized-crime former boss, and Jonathan Pollard, a convicted spy for Israel.
"I forgot I was in prison, he was talking to us as if we were in a restaurant -- he has quite an ego, you could see why people would be drawn to him," Fineman said.
"He told us things that were self-serving to him," she said.
