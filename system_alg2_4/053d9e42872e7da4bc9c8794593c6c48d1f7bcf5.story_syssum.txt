Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Documents showing that China offered to sell arms to Moammar Gadhafi in the waning days of his rule are "the real deal," a senior member of Libya's transitional government said Monday.
"We found several documents that showed us orders, very large orders, of arms and ammunition specifically from China, and now we do know that some of the things that were on the list are here on the ground, and they came in over the last two to six months," said Abdulrahman Busin, NTC spokesman.
And Mohamed Sayeh, a member of the NTC, said Libya's new leaders have seen the documents.
"The Gadhafi regime sent people to China to engage in contact with certain individuals of relevant Chinese companies in July without the knowledge of the Chinese government departments," Jiang Yu, a spokeswoman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told CNN.
But Ibrahim said there was "ongoing resistance" in areas that Gadhafi has lost, and that Gadhafi "is inside of Libya fighting."
The documents NTC officials were examining Monday detailed a trip by Gadhafi's security officials to Beijing on July 16 during which they met with four state-controlled weapons manufacturers, the newspaper reported.
The Chinese said they would replace the Algerian arms sent to Libya, the document said.
China, however, did approve a Security Council resolution that banned military assistance, including the sale of weapons, to Gadhafi's government.
The transitional council has accused Algeria of supporting the Gadhafi regime.
Algeria will in the future recognize the NTC as the government in Libya, Algerian Foreign Minister Mourad Medelci told French radio network Europe 1 last week.
The Ukrainian Embassy in Tripoli and the ministry are rendering proper consular assistance to those arrested, the ministry said.
