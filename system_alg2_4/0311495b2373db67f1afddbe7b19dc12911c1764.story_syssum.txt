(Mental Floss) -- Major League Baseball's umpires are all over the news after a spate of, er, questionable calls throughout this postseason.
After some spotty officiating in the NFL last fall, we did some digging on the officials in the four major sports.
A National Football League ref can make anywhere from $25,000 to $70,000 a season, although since most of the games are on Sundays, they can also have other jobs during the week.
According to MLB.com, MLB umpires get around $120,000 when they start out in the big leagues, and senior umps can earn upwards of $300,000.
Between spring training, a 162-game schedule, and the postseason, being an MLB ump is a job that takes up most of the year.
National Basketball Association refs are similarly well compensated.
If you can skate and survive the occasional lockout, National Hockey League ref is hardly a bad job.
Since NFL refs only work one day each week, they can have "real" jobs to supplement what they earn on any given Sunday.
• Mike Carey, my personal favorite ref, is an entrepreneur and inventor who holds eight patents for snow sports apparel.
He was an Army Reserve colonel during the Persian Gulf War, where he was awarded a bronze star.

• And when Ed Hochuli isn't officiating a game (or working out), you might find him in a courtroom.
Carey started officiating Pop Warner games in 1972 and gradually worked his way up through the college ranks.
Eventually, he became an NFL side judge in 1990 and received a promotion to NFL referee, the pinnacle of football officiating, in 1995.
In a recent op-ed in The New York Times, former baseball commissioner Fay Vincent cited the paltry salaries for minor-league umps: just $9500 for a five-month season for junior umpires, and only $20,000 a season for guys who have risen all the way to Triple A ball.
