But what is a Ponzi scheme?

When he eventually drifted back down to the U.S., he needed a way to make some quick cash.
Ponzi eventually found his way to get rich quick using a vagary of the postal system.
Ponzi started buying and selling postal reply coupons using agents in his native Italy, and he was making a good living doing it.
He started to recruit investors into his system with the promise of 50 percent returns in just a few days.
Ponzi was pocketing millions, and he enjoyed a sumptuous life outside of Boston.
However, since so much money was flowing in from new investors, he could just pay off the returns for the old ones from the new cash.
In fact, Ponzi didn't even need to pay off the old investors, since many of them wanted to reinvest their returns in this wonderful business.
While Barron conceded that there probably was a way for a person to make a small amount of quick cash on the postal reply coupon scheme, he figured that Ponzi would have to be moving 160 million coupons around to raise the cash he needed to support the business.
Barron pointed out the obvious question here: if Ponzi had this failsafe scheme in which he could make a 50 percent profit, why was he putting his own money into plain old investment instruments that would give him (maybe) a 5 percent return?
Ponzi later boasted that he'd taken in a million dollars in new investments the day the report ran.
Although he'd largely placated his investors after Barron's report, Ponzi must have realized his window of opportunity was closing.
Of Ponzi, McMasters said, "The man is a financial idiot.
Ponzi pled guilty to one of these charges in exchange for a light sentence of five years.
