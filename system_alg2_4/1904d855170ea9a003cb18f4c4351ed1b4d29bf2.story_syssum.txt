Walter Kendall Myers, 72, and his wife, Gwendolyn Myers, 71, are charged with conspiracy to act as illegal agents of the Cuban government, wire fraud and providing classified information to Havana, according to court documents.
Investigators found a calendar showing that the couple planned to sail to the Caribbean in November, federal prosecutor Michael Harvey told the court.
They stared straight ahead, and did not appear to acknowledge anyone in the courtroom.
The judge allowed the couple to meet briefly with their son after the court proceedings, but turned down the request to allow them to go home.
U.S. officials did not discuss the Myerses' motives for their alleged work for the Cuban government.
