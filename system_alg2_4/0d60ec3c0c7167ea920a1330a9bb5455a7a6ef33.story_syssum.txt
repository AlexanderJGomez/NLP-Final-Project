On Tuesday night, Instagram was on fire thanks to two posts made by Kim and Khloe Kardashian.
The 34-year-old posed for the winter issue of Paper magazine, which has the express goal of "breaking the Internet."
The result is one cover in which Kim poses in a floor-length gown, balancing a glass of champagne on her rear, while the other cover puts the reality star's best known asset front and center in all its glistening glory.
It isn't clear where the image originated, but Khloe shared that along with her own comment, calling the statement "True."
"We're all equally f****d up," says the photo in the post, which was shared Tuesday.
... and a Jew."
