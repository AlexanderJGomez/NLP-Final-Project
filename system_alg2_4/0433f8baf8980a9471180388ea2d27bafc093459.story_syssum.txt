What is less obvious is that the stakes are sky-high for Barack Obama, too: This debate could have a powerful impact upon his ability to govern in a second term.
The news for the GOP from battleground states is even worse, especially in the Midwest.
Can Romney pull off a debate victory?
So, yes, Romney can still win, but it will be darn hard.
For a long time, his campaign advisers have assumed that he would win but that his margin of victory would be narrow -- less than three points.
Even now, his advisers -- even as they are quietly confident about the ultimate outcome -- are running scared, assuming the race will likely close significantly in the final weeks.
Republicans will have a much harder time challenging his mandate if he wins big.
Obama campaign advisers have been building a powerful ground game for months; they have far more offices in battleground states than Romney.
Members of his team may talk as if they have less at stake than their opponent, but in their hearts, they know that if Obama can put Romney away in their first debate, he could well have some lightning at his command in a second term.
