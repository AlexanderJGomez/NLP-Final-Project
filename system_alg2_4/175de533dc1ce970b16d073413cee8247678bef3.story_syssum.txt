Three months earlier, over dinner, I'd learned about a doctor in Sudan's Nuba mountains, Dr. Tom Catena, who was treating thousands of people -- many of them children -- who'd had limbs blown off in the Sudanese government's bombing raids.
But when I got home and looked up Dr. Catena, I read about one of the patients he'd treated: Daniel -- a 12-year-old boy who, in attempting to protect himself from an aerial attack, wrapped his arms around a tree.
It was one of the most heart-wrenching stories I'd ever read.
In that moment, I realized I couldn't just close the computer, get a glass of water and go to bed.
But I could help one.
I could help Daniel.
Step 3: Attach the hand and the gauntlet, and thread the cabling through each digit, running it back to an attachment point behind the patient's wrist or elbow.
Despite the heat (which kept melting the printing filament) and the bugs (which kept jamming up the 3-D printer motors), I managed to get the 3-D printers working and set about making an arm ... for a real boy, now sitting five feet away from me.
Daniel.
Every time I got frustrated, or something wasn't working right, I just had to look over at Daniel and nothing else mattered.
I had to make it work.
He turned back, looked at the small crowd that had gathered around him, broke into the biggest grin you'd ever seen, then went back in for more.
It was the idea that by helping one, you have the potential to help many -- and that might just be the secret to it all.
Just one step.
Just one person.
Yet, there we were, getting ready to start a hand-making factory, excited about the possibility of making arms for other amputees.
We talked about how many limbs we wanted to make, how many people we wanted to help, how many arms we wanted to have done by the time I return.
