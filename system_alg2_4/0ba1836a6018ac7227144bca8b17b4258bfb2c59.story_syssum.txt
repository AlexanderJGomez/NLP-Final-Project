One year on, reminders are never too far away, from the broken buildings to frequent aftershocks that rattle the city every day.
The magnitude 6.3 quake shook the city for a matter of seconds, but it was long enough to kill 185 people from 14 countries.
One year later, Christchurch remains locked in recovery mode, a city carved into zones labeled by color to indicate the severity of the earthquake damage to homes and land.
The government says around 46% of residents in the red zone have accepted its offer to buy their land.
"They said that our house was sinking towards the river.
They moved out of the red zone in November, but Boyd said their new home suffered damage during the February quake and subsequent aftershocks, and may also need to be demolished.
"It's a city of two parts really," said Matt O'Connell, the earthquake recovery coordinator for the Catholic Diocese, who works in the same office as Boyd.
The February 22 quake was one itself, after a larger, magnitude 7.1 quake the previous September.
It really, really set people back.
There was further damage, no one was injured, but it was a psychological blow for many people," O'Connell said.
"Long term Christchurch will look much different but it will be vibrant, new and a great place to live," Key added.
On the eve of the anniversary, the city buried the unidentified remains of four people who were killed in the quake in a new cemetery.
Tomorrow they'll get back to the long, drawn-out task of rebuilding their lives and moving forward.
