The government was applying a provincial law barring ships traveling under British colony flags from docking at the port, said the state-run Telam news agency.
"Because the ship had previously called at Stanley, it was denied entry to Ushuaia," said Julie Benson, a spokeswoman for Carnival Corp. She was referring to the port city in the Falkland Islands, which are referred to in Argentina as Las Malvinas.
The ship "was this morning refused permission for its scheduled docking in the Argentinian port of Ushuaia by the local mayor on the grounds that it had visited the Falklands Islands two days before," said CNN contributor Robin Oakley, who was aboard the Adonis as a lecturer.
Last month, the Star Princess was denied entry into the Port of Stanley when 74 passengers and crew out of a total of 3,652 had gotten sick after the liner stopped in Ushuaia.
"We all defend Malvinas, but the tourist ships have nothing to do with the request for sovereignty," he told Radio Provincia of Ushuaia.
"The policy that the government is carrying out, in reality, is distancing us from the Malvinas instead of getting us nearer," said Jorge Latana, a journalist who has proposed greater cultural integration with the islands' inhabitants.
In Argentina, it is very odd the way one thinks about Malvinas, because the public thinks of it as if no one lived there.
Santiago Kovadloff, a philosopher, said the incident has nothing to do with sweeping away the British culture that is pervasive in the Falklands.
The country contains "a mountain of English businesses" that are exploiting the country's natural resources.
