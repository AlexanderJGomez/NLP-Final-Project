"All of a sudden, the captain came on and said brace for a landing, and that's when we knew we were going down," he said.
Watch Berretta describe the landing Â»
At first, it felt like the plane was gliding, Berretta said, as if no engines were working.
Panero said the impact felt like a car crash.
"Then all of a sudden, it was 'Get out, get out now,' " Panero said.
"It was scary.
When the plane began to sink, some passengers began to panic, Panero said.
When they were safely out of the plane, Berretta said, there was one more moment of fear.
As Berretta exited the plane, he said that besides a few passengers remaining, the crew and pilot stayed behind to make sure everyone was out.
"I think it was as good of a landing as you can make in a river."
