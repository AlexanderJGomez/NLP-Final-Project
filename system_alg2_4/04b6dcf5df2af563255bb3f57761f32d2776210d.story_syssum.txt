Washington (CNN) -- Congress set off for a two-week recess Friday, flying out of Washington under a dark cloud: the "Do-nothing" label.

: That is the lowest amount in modern history.
The lowest figure during President George W. Bush's term was 136, double the amount passed this year.
"It's not how many bills you pass," Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Alabama, told CNN, "It's how many you stop.
We could look at the days in session, which were officially more than 150 for both the House and Senate.

â€¢ Relatively: That's higher than average for the Senate over the past 30 years.
In other words, Congress spent hundreds of hours in Washington -- far more than average for the Senate -- and still was not able to address most of the biggest issues of the day.
This is perhaps the greatest area of bipartisan agreement: Congress is in Washington, but doing less.
"I think we've been working less, to be honest with you," Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said as he left the last Senate vote of the year.
"I think a majority of the members are trying... and hope that getting back to where the Congress does its job is just right around the next corner," said Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, who previously served as the Republican whip in the House.
"A lot of wasted time to me," Boxer repeated.
