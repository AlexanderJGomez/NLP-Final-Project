Two decades after he first entered the season's third major event, the 42-year-old made history as he triumphed by three shots from Americans Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson in its 140th staging at Royal St. George's in England.
Clarke became the third player from Northern Ireland to win a major title in the past 13 months, following Rory McIlroy's U.S. Open triumph last month and Graeme McDowell's success at the same tournament last year.
He is the first from his country to win the British Open since Fred Daly in 1947.
Clarke, who last finished in the top-10 when he placed third at Royal Lytham & St. Anne's in 2001, could afford to bogey the final two holes as he carded a level-par 70.
The left-hander, seeking to add the British Open to his three Masters and one U.S. PGA Championship crown, carded three birdies and an eagle to grab a share of the lead.
Johnson, seeking his first major title, drove out of bounds at the 14th and his double-bogey there handed Clarke a four-shot buffer.
He was followed by three Americans -- Rickie Fowler (72), Anthony Kim (70) and Chad Campbell (69) -- who were tied for fifth on 280.
England's Tom Lewis was the top amateur, with the 20-year-old tied for 30th as he fell away after sharing the early lead with Bjorn following his opening 65.
