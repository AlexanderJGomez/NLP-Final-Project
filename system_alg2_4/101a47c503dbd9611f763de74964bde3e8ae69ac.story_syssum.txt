Israeli fighter jets struck a Syrian convoy suspected of moving weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon, a senior U.S. official said Wednesday.
Syria, meanwhile, reported an Israeli strike targeting a research facility near the capital city of Damascus.
A former high-ranking Israeli Intelligence official told CNN that Hezbollah likely wants to take hold of all the weapons it can in the event that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is forced to flee.
But the senior U.S. official said American authorities do not believe the strike was linked to growing concerns about chemical weapons.
"Whether it was an attack against a supply convoy or a terrorist leader, it's not particularly surprising," senior Brookings fellow Michael O'Hanlon said.
The United States has provided more than $200 million in humanitarian aid and other funding to the Syrian opposition.
The United States has pressed the Syrian opposition to establish a leadership structure amid a conflict that has claimed the lives of about 60,000 people, according to a United Nations estimate.
