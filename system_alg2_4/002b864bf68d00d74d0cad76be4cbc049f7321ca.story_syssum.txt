The gunman who held hostages for more than 16 hours in a Sydney cafe was no stranger to police -- and was on bail for violent criminal offenses at the time of the siege.
The self-styled Muslim cleric, also known as Sheikh Haron, was facing dozens of charges at the time of the siege, including two counts of being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife, according to the Attorney General of New South Wales.
He said Monis used to beat Pal, forcing her to wear a hijab all the time and forbidding her from talking to "outsiders."
The letters were "sadistic, wantonly cruel and deeply wounding," one High Court judge said at the time, according to CNN affiliate Seven News.
Monis had been granted political asylum in 2001 and had had no further contact with his birth country, the spokesperson said.
His broader cause, he said, was lobbying governments around the world, particularly Australia, not to wage wars on Muslim soil.
During the siege, Abbott said, the hostage-taker "sought to cloak his actions with the symbolism of the (ISIS) death cult," Abbott said.
His last tweet linked to his website, with a haunting message posted the day of his attack on the Sydney cafe: "If we stay silent towards the criminals we cannot have a peaceful society.
Hundreds of police officers, including snipers, took position around the Lindt Chocolate Cafe in Sydney's central business district.
The man holding the hostages demanded to speak to Abbott.
Gunfire erupted early Tuesday as police stormed the cafe where the gunman had been holding hostages.
Two hostages were killed during the standoff.
