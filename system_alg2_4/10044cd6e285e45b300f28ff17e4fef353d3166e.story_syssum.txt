(CNN) -- Political groups and campaigns hoping to sway voters on the health care issue have spent about $70 million on health-themed TV ads since January 2011, according to a CNN analysis of ad spending data.
We are excited about the closure of the Medicare doughnut hole coverage gap with medications.
Most groups' health care ads were soundly opposed to the law.
The 60 Plus Association, which characterizes itself as the conservative alternative to AARP, spent $1.6 million on 2,861 spots.
Among the candidates, Obama's campaign spent $3.46 million on 8,211 spots, and presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney spent $3.8 million on 7,181 spots.
His ad asks, "Why am I leading the fight to stop President Obama's health care law?
"If I were a Republican candidate I would fill the airwaves with attack ads against Obamacare, just like they are doing, because this is one of the weakest links for this administration," Westen said.
The delay in implementing that provision, Westen says, let conservative groups run ads against the law before Americans experienced its benefits.
No matter what decision the U.S. Supreme Court reaches on the legislation, he says, expect to see more ads on health care in the future.
