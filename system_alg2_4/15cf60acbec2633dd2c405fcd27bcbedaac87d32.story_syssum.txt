When Kreshnik Berisha, the first suspected member of ISIS to stand trial in Germany, was arrested upon his arrival back in Frankfurt in December after spending six months in Syria, youth team football coach Meyer was left shell-shocked.
"I didn't think it was serious -- I remember when the journalist told me, I didn't believe it," said Meyer, who is also the president of the 40 different Makkabi clubs in Germany, which he says has some 4,500 members.
Berisha is expected to receive a sentence of between three to four-and-a-half years for allegedly being a member of a foreign terrorist organization.
"The inconceivable violence used by the Alawite Assad regime against the Sunni majority was enraging and bewildering.
In his statement, Berisha told the court how he was hoping to lead a normal life after serving out his sentence.
With 30 sports on offer and 23 different football teams for ages as young as four all the way through to 55, it is a club at the very center of the Frankfurt community.
"A few people in the community were shocked and called me to discuss what we should do," he said.
