Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Protests broke out Friday throughout Northern Ireland against a decision by Belfast City Council members to stop flying the Union flag year-round.
At least one officer appeared injured.
In all, four police officers were hurt, with one requiring hospital treatment, and two people were arrested, police said.
The leaders of the two main unionist political parties met Thursday to discuss concerns within the unionist community.
Northern Ireland authorities have accused loyalist extremists of exploiting the decision by Belfast officials to end the century-old tradition of flying the Union flag over City Hall 365 days a year.
The three decades of ensuing violence between loyalists and the IRA claimed more than 3,000 lives, most of them north of the border.
Under the terms of the accord, groups on both sides dumped their weapons, and members of Sinn Fein, the political affiliate of the IRA, now work with pro-British politicians in Northern Ireland's power-sharing government.
