ET), Hannover police press officer Stefan Wittke said in a statement.
Police did not elaborate on what evidence they had that pointed to suicide, but Enke's close friend and advisor Jorg Neblung told the official Web site of football's world governing body FIFA: "I can confirm that it was suicide.
"We are in a state of shock," said team manager Oliver Bierhoff in a statement from the German Football Federation.
The German Football Federation (DFB) said Enke always said he wanted to play for the national team at the 2010 World Cup.
The couple's two-year-old daughter died in 2006 from a heart condition, and Honigstein said the loss of his child had taken a toll on Enke.
"I don't know why and how this happened," said Martin Kind, the chairman of Hannover 96.
"But he kept it under wraps."
