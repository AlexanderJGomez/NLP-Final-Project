(CNN) -- Investors of Russian assets have had their first real chance to assess the situation in Ukraine and they didn't like what they saw.
While this is being positioned domestically in Russia as a move by President Vladimir Putin on behalf of Russians in the east of Ukraine, the military action probably will not sit well with those in the middle class who took to the streets over the past year.
He proudly predicted Russia would continue to grow at 4% with ample reserves of a half trillion dollars saved for a rainy day.
At the World Energy Congress in South Korea late last year, the energy minister Alexander Novak spelled out plans for Russian reserves to expand handsomely over the coming years.
But as the world is finding out, one cannot live on energy alone with an economy of 140 million people.
Ukraine is carrying an unmanageable amount of debt -- nearly $30 billion comes due by the end of 2015, about half of that this year.
About a third of Russia's daily oil output of nearly ten million barrels a day goes to Europe as well.
Finally, the U.S. may be suffering from military fatigue after years in Iraq and Afghanistan and the European Union from expansion fatigue.
