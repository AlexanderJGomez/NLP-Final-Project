Washington (CNN) -- With just days to go until a self-imposed deadline, fixes to the problem-plagued Obamacare website are "definitely on track," Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said Tuesday.
In particular, they accuse Obama and Democrats of having lied when they pledged that people could keep health coverage they liked.
In response, Obama said insurers can choose to continue offering canceled policies, even if they failed to meet new requirements under the health care reforms.
Now some states have reported stronger numbers, and Sebelius said Tuesday that more people were signing up daily.
In addition, more than 370,000 have signed up for Medicaid under state programs expanded through the health care reforms, the CNN count shows.
