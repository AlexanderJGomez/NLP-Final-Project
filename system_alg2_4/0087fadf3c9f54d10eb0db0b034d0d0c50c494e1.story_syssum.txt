Venice, Louisiana (CNN) -- A wind shift could push more oil from BP's Deepwater Horizon gusher into the Mississippi Delta and areas west of the river, which is "bad news for Louisiana," Gov.
"We've said all along that the oil coming west of the river would pose a whole new set of challenges," Jindal said at a news conference.
She said booms were being moved toward Grand Isle in anticipation of oil reaching the area soon.
Only a few birds have been taken to a wildlife rehabilitation center at Fort Jackson, Louisiana, he said.
The stakes are high for residents of coastal Louisiana who make their living from fishing in the Gulf of Mexico.
The affected area, which is east of the Mississippi Delta, comprises about 4.5 percent of the Gulf of Mexico, NOAA said.
David Nagel, executive vice president of BP America, said the blowout preventer may be working better than some people believe, limiting the gusher to 5,000 barrels of oil a day.
Suttles said BP is drilling a relief well to try to divert the flow to another pipe.
The well is at about 9,000 feet.
It may take up to three months to reach the target area, Nagel said.
On Friday, BP lowered the massive containment vessel over the well to cap the larger of two leak points.
BP has built the smaller dome and it is already available, Suttles said Monday.
The structure is to be deployed this week by the drill ship Enterprise, to which it is to be connected by two strings of pipe -- one inside the other with a space in between for hot water, he said.
BP has received 3,400 claims for lost income and damages and 295 of those claims have been paid, at a price of $3.5 million, Nagel said.
Also Monday, organizers announced a "Gulf Aid" benefit concert for south Louisiana fishermen and wetlands restoration.
