The family qualifies for the federal government's free pre-kindergarten program, Head Start, but has been on a waiting list for more than a year.
A U.S. Government Accountability Office investigation that concluded in May showed that several Head Start workers committed fraud to enroll families whose incomes were above the federally mandated limit.
Documents that whistleblowers leaked to the GAO showed that some workers admitted children whose parents made more than $110,000.
A 10-year study released in 2010 by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services showed that Head Start kids are better prepared academically and socially to enter kindergarten.
Parenting skills improved, too, among those whose kids were in Head Start, according to the HHS study.
The investigators' documents showed they made too much money to enroll, but at eight of the 15 Head Start centers they approached, staff members pretended they hadn't seen the income levels, or they urged parents to lie.
The problem, Kutz said, is that Head Start workers only have to sign a statement that they've seen proof of parents' incomes.
"If you want to go in and say you are unemployed, you could get benefits even if you were making $100,000 because [Head Start wasn't] validating anything," Kutz said.
Yvette Sanchez Fuentes, Head Start's national director, said she took action immediately after learning about the federal investigation last spring.
According to Sanchez Fuentes, Head Start officials advised local directors about enrollment procedures, bulked up on admissions training and now make unannounced visits to local programs.
"We will make sure that when we go out to see these local programs, that they are indeed doing the right things and that every federal dollar that goes to Head Start is not being misused."
Demand for Head Start remains strong, even in programs where there's no suspicion of fraud.
"I know they could do a much better job."
