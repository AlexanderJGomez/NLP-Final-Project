It was the earliest defeat for Federer in a tournament this year, ending his hopes of claiming the Monte Carlo title for the first time after being beaten three times in the final by Rafael Nadal.
The second followed a similar pattern, with Federer unable to capitalize on his seven break points in the match as the seventh seed went through.
When he had break points I was calm and served well.
Melzer will now play world number six David Ferrer after the Spaniard saw off 11th Viktor Troicki of Serbia 6-3 6-3 in an earlier match Friday.
Nadal will face off against Britain's Andy Murray for a place in Sunday's final after the number three seed continued his fine run with a 6-1 6-2 dismissal of Portuguse qualifier Frederico Gil in just over an hour.
