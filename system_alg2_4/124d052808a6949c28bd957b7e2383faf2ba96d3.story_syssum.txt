In 2008, after a bruising primary battle with Hillary Clinton, then-Sen. Barack Obama was on the outs with former President Bill Clinton.
"Clinton just wants to help," a source close to the former president said.
"His message is 'I know what it takes on the economy, and Obama is doing the right thing.'
I think it really -- I think a president ought to have done something for other people and for his country when you pick a president," Clinton said.
"I'm here, not my husband," Hillary Clinton said to Obama.
As Obama struggles to appeal to white, working-class males, he hopes Clinton can woo those voters in key Southern and Rust Belt states.
While the Obama campaign tries to make a liability of presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney's past as the head of a private equity firm, Clinton recently punched a hole in what has been a central campaign argument.
"There's no question that in terms of getting up and going to the office and, you know, basically performing the essential functions of the office, the man who has been governor and had a sterling business career crosses the qualification threshold."
