And yet now, at the age of 56, he remains philosophical about his life -- one in which he emerged to become one of the greatest to have ever played the game of golf.
"I lost my father when I was 10 and sometimes that has an adverse effect on the family but for us it brought us closer together.
I've had a great time.
But there is one victory away from all of his personal success which stands out -- the victory of the international team over the U.S. at the 1998 Presidents Cup at Melbourne.
"Our three kids were born here and I've just had the best time ever here," said Price, who lives in Florida.
History is not on Price's side -- the U.S. has dominated the competition, losing just once and being held once in the previous nine editions.
"I don't want to see them become enemies for one week -- what I want to see is great competition.
Price realizes his team faces a difficult challenge to triumph in Columbus, Ohio but says he will do all that he can as captain to inspire his men to a momentous victory.
"I'm trying to be a captain that is going to be very supportive of my team but not over captain them and there's a very fine line between that.
I'm going to be there."
