Australian luxury yacht captain Drew Gollan was killed in January in English Harbor, Antigua.
A local man has been arrested by police in connection with the incident.
In a press release, the Antigua Charter Yacht Meeting acknowledged that "a number of boats have decided to leave Antigua in the wake of this incident."
After the death of Gollan, local Antigua politicians and yacht industry representatives held an emergency meeting to discuss the problem.
An international charter company manager and luxury yacht industry expert, Els Bucknell, said yacht crews and clients were "shocked and saddened" by the deaths, and there would likely be a short-term impact on the Caribbean region.
"People do forget about these things over time ... and the local business people with police and other authorities have made a serious attempt to make it safer.
