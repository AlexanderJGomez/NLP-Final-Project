"I was amazed by the beauty of the fishing boats, many of which were old, damaged by the salt and the sun or abandoned," remembers Llonch, who was at the time cycling solo around the West African country.
His idea was to work with skillful local craftsmen and breathe new life into the traditional "pirogues" by transforming them into hand-made furniture.
"It's like a reincarnation of something that had life before -- a life in the Atlantic, a life in Africa," says Llonch.
Llonch says that what makes the furniture special is the history behind it and the creativity of the artisans working with raw materials that are hard to remodel.
"This wood ... has certain limitations, not only because it has a shape but also because it's very damaged by the salt, the sea, the sun and the time.
"We started with the fishing boats ... because I was astonished when I saw the beaches with these stylish boats but maybe this is just the beginning," adds Llonch.
