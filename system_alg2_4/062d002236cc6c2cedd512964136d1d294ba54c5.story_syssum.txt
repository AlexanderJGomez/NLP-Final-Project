The Google Maps app held the top position until October, when Apple rolled out its latest mobile operating system, iOS 6, and replaced the built-in Google Maps app with its own, less accurate version.
User reviews in Apple's App Store shot up as a result, and in December the company followed up with a better version of its Android app.
The social network's app was the single largest, single app time suck, accounting for 23% of the time people spend using mobile apps, according to comScore.
After Maps, Google Play, Google Search, Gmail and YouTube were the top apps on Android and iOS devices in December.
Google only re-released an iOS version of its Maps app in December, which could continue to fight back and possibly overtake Facebook in 2013.
