It may now be Albania's liveliest neighborhood, but a little over two decades ago it wasn't even on the map.
The Block ('Ish-Blloku' in Albanian) was Hoxha's refuge.
"If you could compare it, Albania was like North Korea is today," says Enno Bozdo, Tirana's deputy mayor.
At street level too, the neighborhood is almost unrecognizable.
Dozens of cafes, bars and restaurants have made it Tirana's premier nightspot.
The Block was his perfect opportunity.
On big nights tables are booked in advance, even for drinks.
"Youngsters say phrases like, 'it's nice to be in love' and 'you're sexy' in English.
Rents in the city are usually pegged at about $250 per month.
Drinks are still pretty cheap by Western standards at about $1.50 for a local beer, and dinner in most places costs roughly 600 Albanian lek, or $6.
"I like it here," she says.
In 2007 a shade more than a million people visited the country.
It's great: the people are young and nice."
"It's impossible to understand what that regime was like without living in it anyway," he says.
For coffee: Radio Cafe Tirana.

Yes, its theme might be cheesier than cheddar sandwich, but Duff is packed most nights and it's a great spot for people-watching in the heart of The Block.
Good for a romantic meal beside the madness.
