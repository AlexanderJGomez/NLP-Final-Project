LONDON, England (CNN) -- Campaigners in London planned to petition the British government Friday for a posthumous pardon for the hundreds of people executed for witchcraft between the 16th and 18th centuries.
Around 400 people were executed in England and some 4,000 in Scotland for alleged witchcraft, campaigners say.
The Witchcraft Act of 1735 put an end to trials of accused witches, but many still faced persecution and jail for other crimes such as fraud.
In 1645, clergyman John Lowes was regarded as too attached to Catholicism in a strongly Reformed area.
Lowes was hanged in Bury St. Edmunds, England, after conducting his own funeral.
"The notion that people could suspend their disbelief and believe that women were talking to toads -- just horrible times.
In its ruling, the court pardoned both the accused witches and their cats who, it said, were executed for "conjuration or sorcery."
Webb said while few people today may believe those men and women deserved execution, their stories still generate suspicion and stigma.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice would not comment on the case but said the granting of such a pardon is extremely rare.
Accused witches were also tried and put to death in the famous Salem witch trials in the U.S. state of Massachusetts in the late 1600s, but all were later pardoned, said Alison D'Amario, director of education at the Salem Witch Museum.
The names of 14 were cleared in 1711 after their families applied to the government, D'Amario said.
"Their names are now on a list that makes it seem as though they were innocent, which they surely were," D'Amario said.
