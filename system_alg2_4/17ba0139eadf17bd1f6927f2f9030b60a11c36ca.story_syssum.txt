Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird even went as far as to boldly state that "Canada will never become a safe haven for zombies, ever."
Canada's zombie preparedness means one thing for us: Zombies will be driven out of Canada and into the United States.
Why?
Sure, you can point zombies in the direction of Canada and hope they keep walking as a pack over the border, but they're easily distracted.
!
Sorry, Max and Hollywood: Zombies don't need a hug; they need a swift kick out of our country.
Plus, keep in mind that if even only a few zombies make it over the border, these "anchor zombies" will create more and more zombies.
I'm talking about the greater risk they pose to our federal deficit because they will want handouts from our government.
How long after that do you think it will be until these people argue that zombies should be covered under Obamacare?!
Brooks and I did agree that we need the federal government to respond to the dangers posed by an influx of zombies.
Nice try, Max, but that's just another ploy by you and your elitist friends to get us to give up control of our nation to the United Nations.
I hope my fellow Americans wake up before it's too late.
If not, then I hope the Rosetta Stone starts teaching us how to speak zombie, because we are all going to need it.
