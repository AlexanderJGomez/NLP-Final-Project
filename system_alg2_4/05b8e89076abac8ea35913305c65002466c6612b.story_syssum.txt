The co-founder of popular Hong Kong restaurant Chachawan Isaan Thai and Bar, Wong woke up and logged onto her computer to find a friend had forwarded her multiple images of a second Chachawan restaurant in Shanghai.
The Shanghai Chachawan bore the hallmarks of her successful Hong Kong eatery.
"It is extremely disappointing to see the restaurant in China has used not just the Chachawan name, but also our exact logo and font which was designed specially for us," Wong tells CNN.
"I'm surprised that they say they have no idea about Chachawan since the owners have dined at Chachawan [in Hong Kong], and in fact had formal meetings with chef Adam Cliff and owner Yenn Wong in April this year, expressing their interest in taking the concept to [mainland China], which was declined," says Kiri Sinclair, a public relations spokesperson for Chachawan in Hong Kong.
Some 22 illegal stores were identified and forbidden to use the Apple logo.
After Chinese President Xi Jinping was spotted lining up for steamed dumplings at one of Beijing's Qing-feng steamed dumpling chain shops, the store began attracting even longer-than-usual queues ... as well as imitators.
"Generally speaking, a lot of people don't understand the concept of registering the name of their restaurant or store as a trademark," says Hong Kong-based Rosita Li, an intellectual property partner in global law firm Mayer Brown JSM..
"Chachawan can take legal action only if it has registered its trademark in China, or can prove that its mark is well-known in China," Dr. Li tells CNN.
"Otherwise, it has a very slim chance to win and I do not recommend suing."
