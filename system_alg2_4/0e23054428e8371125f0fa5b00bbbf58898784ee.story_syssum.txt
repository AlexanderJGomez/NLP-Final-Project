(CNN) -- I have always been a fiercely independent woman.
Then, I met "Tom," who was much older and more successful than me.
A lot of my friends, however, were beginning to settle down and I started to feel like something was wrong with me for not being able to even fathom doing the same.
Tom was a nice man who seemed to take a liking to me quite quickly.
Or at least, that's how I felt.
We all know what sugar daddies are: Wealthy older men have throughout history sought out much younger women -- "sugar babies" -- to date, even marry and take care of.
Now there's nothing wrong with being in a relationship in which one person financially supports the other.
I am now married and have a child with a man who is quite successful in his own right.
But, it serves as a constant reminder of a time when I didn't recognize myself, and that didn't feel very good.
