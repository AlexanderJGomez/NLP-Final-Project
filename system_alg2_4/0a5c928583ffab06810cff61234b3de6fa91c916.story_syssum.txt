The Seminoles (13-0) outscored the Tigers (12-2) 24-10 after halftime to win their third national title.
It was FSU's second BCS crown and third national title.
The Tigers appeared to be on the verge of their second title in four seasons when Tre Mason scored a go-ahead touchdown on a determined 37-yard scamper with 1:19 left in the game.
The only score in the third quarter was a 41-yard field goal by FSU kicker Roberto Aguayo.
Auburn kicker Cody Parkey's 22-yard field goal with 4:42 left made the score 24-20.
The game was the final championship contest under the current system, which featured the top two teams in the Bowl Championship Series poll.
