(CNN) -- Charlie Sheen has filed a lawsuit against adult film actress Capri Anderson, claiming she tried to extort money from him following an October incident at New York's Plaza Hotel, a representative for the actor told CNN Monday.
She answered that she was in  shock, "I never expected the night to unfold the way it did," said  Anderson.
"We're going to defend these charges vigorously and she will never get a check from Charlie Sheen," Galanter said.
She also  accused Sheen of "snorting a white, powdery substance."
