(CNN) -- Two Florida school administrators face contempt charges and possible prison time for saying a prayer at a school luncheon.
Still, an ACLU representative said the organization never suggested that people should go to jail for violating the decree.
The ACLU filed suit last year against the district on behalf of two Pace students who alleged that "school officials regularly promoted religion and led prayers at school events," according to an ACLU statement.
On January 28, "Lay asked Freeman to offer a prayer of blessing during a school-day luncheon for the dedication of a new fieldhouse at Pace High School," according to court documents.

Wyrosdick recounted telling Lay that the prayer was not appropriate.
The ACLU, according to the Liberty Counsel statement, has begun "to go against individual employees."
The ACLU did not request the criminal contempt charges against Lay and Freeman, he said; the judge initiated them after seeing a reference to the incident in a motion.
Lay is not facing jail time for praying, he said, but for violating a court order.
Neither Lay nor Freeman has been placed on leave, according to the school district.
