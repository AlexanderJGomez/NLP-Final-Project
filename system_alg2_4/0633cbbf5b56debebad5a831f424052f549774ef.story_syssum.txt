In it, all the houses on one block look the same.
The popular book sounds like an allegory about communism, and conformist lifestyles.
The result—those decorated houses—are the subject of Hungarian Cubes, by Katharina Roters.
It's fitting, then, that during the Goulash Communism era, a peculiar architectural trend took off: People started painting the facades of their houses with abstract shapes, in wild shades of color.
In Hungarian Cubes, Roters documents those countryside row houses during Kádár's reign, after residents started freewheeling with colors and shapes to make it so no two houses looked like.
"Today you can buy a car you like, you can do everything you like.
This was a free space at this time where the people can show and express their individuality."
Hungarian Cubes is available here, through Park Books.
