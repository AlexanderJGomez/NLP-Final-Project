"It's possible she could be booked in and booked out" the same day, Los Angeles County Sheriff spokesman Steve Whitmore said Wednesday afternoon.
The actress, who admitted violating her probation during a hearing Wednesday, must report to the Los Angeles County jail by November 9, the judge said.
When Sautner sentenced Lohan to 120 days in jail last May, she ended up serving 35 days of home confinement instead, due to jail overcrowding and state rules that give prisoners credit for good behavior.
Lohan, 25, was already on probation for two drunken driving convictions from 2007.
While the original sentence included 360 hours of community service at a downtown Los Angeles women's center, the judge said she did not want to put the Skid Row charity through the pain of Lohan again.
But Lohan seemed to find a good fit with her work at the Los Angeles County morgue, where Deputy Chief Coroner Ed Winter said she worked four days in the past two weeks cleaning up.
Last week, Michael Lohan was arrested twice in two days for violating a court order to stay away from his former girlfriend.
It has been extended several times because of violations, including the failed alcohol and drug tests.
