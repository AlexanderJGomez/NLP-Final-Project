Until recently Woodside and about 100 hundred other divers searched Puget Sound for sea cucumbers and urchins to sell to buyers in Asia, where the items are considered delicacies.
But thanks to a small piece of the federal stimulus recovery plan, Monk, Woodside and about 40 other fishermen will get back to work hauling in a very different catch: lost fishing nets.
The nets, some of which extend larger than a football field, can also tangle the propellers of boats and pose a danger to scuba divers.
The only reason the nets have remained underwater for so long, said Ginny Broadhurst, director of the Northwest Marine Conservation Initiative, is because the damage they are doing to the environment is invisible from the surface.
But pulling those nets is no easy task.
When the divers find the fields of nets, they begin the labor of cutting them free piece by piece and all by hand.
In just a few hours on the water, the divers can pull free about 1,000 pounds of nets.
The fishing nets themselves are considered toxic after the years of catching so much sea life.
But biologist June said the group is working on a plan that would have the nets burned, creating energy from lost fishing nets.
"[With] harvest diving we are taking from the resources; here we are giving them back."
