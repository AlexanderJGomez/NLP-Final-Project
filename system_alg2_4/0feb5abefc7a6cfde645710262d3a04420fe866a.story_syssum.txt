Frankly, I don't know how public figures get through it.
In Washington, someone is always out to get you."
So, somewhat like a National Enquirer reporter who dreams up his day's "scoop" while showering, Drudge teases his readers with innuendo and fluff.
People Magazine did a story on Clinton, and the photographer taking the picture for the front cover asked Clinton to stand by a lawn chair, grab the top, and lean into the camera.
So Drudge tweeted the picture, asking, "Is Clinton Holding a Walker?"
Drudge's tweet fits in with Karl Rove's orchestrated charge in mid-May that maybe Hillary Clinton was "brain damaged" because of a fall she suffered.
Apparently, though Drudge (and perhaps The Wall Street Journal, which had no problem accepting his "con") wanted to turn Rove's "will it stick to the wall" into a meme.
"It's better not to argue with women," Putin said, "but Mrs. Clinton has never been too graceful in her statements."
His "It's better not to argue with women," clearly shows Putin learned from his domestic encounters.
Politico ran the quote with the observation, "This isn't going to play well in Moscow."
We can expect a lot more to be said about Hillary Clinton, since her memoir, "Hard Choices," is coming out.
And, unfortunately, I'm also sure some in the media will be right there with some tweetle-dumb about it.
