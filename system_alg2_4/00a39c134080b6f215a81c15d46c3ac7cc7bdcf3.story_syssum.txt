ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Dressed head to toe in black, designer Isaac Mizrahi is wearing an outfit that seems to contradict his personality -- and his usual fashion flair.
It's just one more style tip you can pick up from Mizrahi's new book "How to Have Style" (Gotham).
CNN talked to Mizrahi about his love for theater, the most common fashion mistakes and why bad flowers are never OK.
Isaac Mizrahi: Well, you know what, I think it's all theater.
And I think that these days, as a fashion designer, it's almost like you represent a political party or something.
And in the end, I am like this personality that represents that.
So to me it's all one big world.
Mizrahi: It changes every day, and I really like that.
Some days I work in the showroom; some days I work in the design room; some days I actually work in my own private studio, where I just do sketches and sketches and sketches.
I feel like it really disrupts what I love doing most, which is this creation, you know what I mean?
Mizrahi: I see a lot, a lot, a lot of bad hair.
You know people have excuses for bad shoes -- because you know some people have back problems, it is the street and they're walking and walking and walking -- but I do think that people have no excuse for bad hair.
But I always think that women should be encouraged to spend a lot of money on their hair.
Mizrahi: You know what it is with people?
I like to think about cabinets.
No.
I think that nothing is way better than bad flowers.
Mizrahi: I don't know.
I can't say about my personality, but I like to think that I'm very exposed to what's going on out there in the world culturally, and that's what influences my design.
Here's a good description of my personality: claustrophobic.
I am very claustrophobic.
