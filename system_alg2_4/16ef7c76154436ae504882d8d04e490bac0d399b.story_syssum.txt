(CNN) -- In his September 4 op-ed, Jack Schlossberg presents his case that young Americans should cast their ballots for President Obama this fall.
Schlossberg concedes that we're "a little more cynical," but contends that "just because our politics and government can disappoint us sometimes doesn't mean we should forget how far we've come."
Or, according to this analysis, that half of recent college graduates are jobless or underemployed Or that under Obama, the national debt has risen $5 trillion.
In a word, travesty.
But the problem with that analysis is that it's four years out of date.
Obama regards students as beneficiaries of his achievements.
Schlossberg's discussion of Obama's energy policy is equally selective.
His fiscal stewardship has been nothing short of a disaster.
But in this case, it's about coming to terms with the fact that Obama has had his chance to lead and his policies have failed.
We can reward truth-telling.
