Mohammed Asif Mohseni is said to be behind the law.
He is said to be the man behind the controversial Shia state law, a law critics say strips Afghan Shia women of many rights.
Nonetheless, we were sent back to where Mohseni was waiting.
He looked at the two men who brought us in and said, "These aren't the two I was waiting for."
Mohseni welcomed us and asked me to translate his warm welcome to our Scottish cameraman.
"The law ... which I created I see as correct for both men and women," he said.
We give women more in this law."
"When a couple marries, sex is a part of marriage, and they agree to that."
Women should put make-up on for their husbands as it will increase the love and attraction between the two."
More importantly, he said, a couple needs to make clear the day they marry whether or not she will need permission to leave the home.
It's the same here.
However, it's not just people in the West who are opposed to this law.
Clear-cut.
Samar said the law does not represent Islam.
"If she doesn't (put on make-up), will the husband go complain to the police that she didn't put (on) the lipstick?
And none of the state institutions, ministry of justice, parliament, senate and the office of the president, really didn't look at the law as serious as they should," she said.
