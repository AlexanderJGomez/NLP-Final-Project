Ford and Mazda said 591,245 vehicles were potentially affected, according to the automakers' reports to the NHTSA in 2004.
Mazda and Ford issued recalls in 2004 on models of the sport utility vehicles that had 3.0 liter six cylinder engines.
The 2004 Ford and Mazda recalls were for the vehicle speed control cables in their affected vehicles.
"On your vehicle, it is possible that the accelerator cable may prevent the throttle from returning to the idle position, possibly resulting in elevated engine speeds while driving," Ford's letter to customers read.
The NHTSA has opened the investigation to assess "the scope, frequency and safety-related consequences of the alleged defect," the agency said.
