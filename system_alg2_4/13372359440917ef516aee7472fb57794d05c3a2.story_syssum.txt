Along The Libya-Tunisia Border (CNN) -- A green flag fluttering in the wind designated Libyan territory.
The U.N. refugee agency reported that nearly 150,000 people have crossed over from Libya into Tunisia and Egypt.
Now, many of them said they had everything stolen from them on the road to the border and are left with nothing but the clothes on their back.
Ataye said he tried to catch a flight out of Tripoli's airport to Egypt, but was forced back by thousands of people waiting there.
I don't know," he said.
Luciano, deployed to the Egyptian border town of Sallum to help shuttle people out, said his agency was working with the embassies of nations involved as well as the companies that hired the migrant workers to return them home safely.
Sohel, who had been working for a Korean construction company in the eastern Libyan city of Durna for three years, was anxious to board a plane back home to Bangladesh.
It's easier for Egyptian workers to make it back home, Luciano said, but nonetheless, they face a difficult situation.
"As we know, Egypt is also under a lot of stress now politically," said Hovig Etyemezian, a field officer with the U.N. refugee agency.
"The biggest priority is to take people out of the country," Etyemezian said.
Police and soldiers watched, as young Tunisian volunteers used sticks to beat back people trying to jump over a wall next to the border gate into Tunisia.
Tunisian authorities told the agency that about 75,000 people have streamed into Tunisia.
They may be targets for retribution after reports that embattled Gadhafi recruited mercenaries from those nations to suppress the uprising in his country.
