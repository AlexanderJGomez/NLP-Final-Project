The bank has admitted to overcharging approximately 4,500 members of the U.S. military on their mortgages and said it accidentally foreclosed on 18 service members' homes.
But Mudick's mea culpa was not enough for many on the committee.
Are you, as the executive VP who was given to us from the bank to answer for this stuff, should you go to jail?"

"That is the weakest answer I have ever heard given in front of this committee, that we couldn't read the military orders, coming from one of the largest financial institutions in the world," he said.

They include a centralized unit set up to specialize in SCRA loans, with employees trained in reading military orders, as well as a new hotline staffed by employees trained specifically on how to answer SCRA borrower questions.

The committee's concerns that banks are not taking the civil relief act seriously enough were echoed in the testimony of one attorney representing service members in a class action lawsuit against Chase.

It's still in the back of your mind," said Rowles.
"Anything that's adding stress to a service member, especially in a combat zone, is incredibly risky behavior, so no stone should go unturned," said Walz.
