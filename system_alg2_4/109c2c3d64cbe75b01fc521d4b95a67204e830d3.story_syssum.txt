New York (CNN) -- A New York college student died of head injuries last week during a fraternity ritual held in Pennsylvania, the local coroner's office said Monday.
Charges are expected in Deng's death, which occurred after a fraternity pledge event at a residence in the Pocono Mountains, Monroe County District Attorney E. David Christine said last week.
Later, three fraternity members drove Deng to a Pennsylvania hospital early on the morning of December 8, authorities said.
In a statement, Baruch College said last week that Deng died while participating in an unsanctioned fraternity pledging event.
