The measles outbreak that began when unvaccinated Amish missionaries traveled to the Philippines has more than doubled in size in 10 days, Ohio health officials reported Friday.
Amado said the number of cases had slowed down, but then picked up to about 20 cases per day this week.
So far all the cases are within the Amish community and have been contained to six Ohio counties.
Philippines is experiencing a very large measles outbreak; at least 20,000 confirmed and suspected cases have been reported in the Asian nation.
"This year represents the highest number of cases reported in the United States during this time period in 18 years,"  Dr. Greg Wallace, head of measles activities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an e-mail.
The CDC is reporting a total of 216 cases in 18 states from January 1 to May 16.
