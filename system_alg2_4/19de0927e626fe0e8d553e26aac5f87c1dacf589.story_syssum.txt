They were here to see "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview," a documentary of sorts that's now playing in a handful of U.S. cities.
The master copy of the interview was lost in transit, but director Paul Sen had secretly kept a copy on VHS tape, Cringely said.
"It was the first time in 16 years he touched the tape," Cringely told the audience at Thursday's screening.
He spoke candidly and with emotion.
"He never sat for another interview like this, and what a shame," Cringely said.
Cringely, then a technology columnist, managed to score a coveted interview with Jobs because NeXT desperately needed the attention and because Cringely and Jobs had a prior relationship.
"The only problem with Microsoft is, they just have no taste," he said in a now-famous line.
Jobs predicted the meteoric rise of the Internet, which he said would be especially satisfying because Microsoft doesn't own it.
"People like symbols," Jobs said.
