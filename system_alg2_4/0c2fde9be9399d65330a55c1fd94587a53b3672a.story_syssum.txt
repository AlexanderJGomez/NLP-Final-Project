Grosseto, Italy (CNN) -- The captain of the Italian cruise liner Costa Concordia "committed a tragic error," but his crew did their best to evacuate the ship's 3,200 passengers, the last survivor found aboard said Wednesday.
But, he said, Schettino "committed a tragic error.
He also oversaw the evacuation that followed Concordia's grounding.
Schettino had invited him to the bridge to watch as he steered the ship past Giglio in what the captain called "a salute" to the island town, Giampedroni told reporters on his way out of the hospital.
Schettino has said that after the impact, he ran the ship aground to keep it from sinking and limit its list.
Critics have also questioned whether Schettino waited too long to give the order to abandon ship.
Most of the 3,000-plus passengers and the ship's crew of about 1,000 made it safely off the ship in less than two hours, he said.
Giampedroni was half-submerged in the chilly water flooding the restaurant when found.
He said he survived by sipping at a soft drink that he caught as it floated by, since the contents had not been contaminated with salt water.
