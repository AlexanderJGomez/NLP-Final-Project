Today, Germany is the world's fourth largest economy, and the most important market in the European Union.
The roots of Germany's 21st century economic success date back to the Industrial Revolution, when Germans were early adopters of rail transportation and coal production.
What West Germans found when they entered East Germany was a society marked by high unemployment rate, low productivity and a lot of poverty.
By the end of the 1990s, businesses from Germany played key roles in countries transitioning to a market economy, according to Erixon.
Germany turned into one of the world's largest exporters by going even further east to the emerging Asian markets, especially China and India, according to Irwin Collier, professor of economics at Free University Berlin.
"The high Chinese growth rates meant there was enormous demand for German goods."
"The apprenticeship scheme is very important in particular for manufacturing companies because they train people at mid-level skills in a very specific way," said Hassel.
During the 2008-09 financial crisis, the loss of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Germany experienced was large compare to other countries, and even today fluctuations in the world economy are immediately felt in the German economy.
It needs to increase domestic consumption, which has been relatively weak for decades, otherwise the economic growth it has experienced will not be sustained.
But as Germans know better than anyone, economic realities can change very quickly.
