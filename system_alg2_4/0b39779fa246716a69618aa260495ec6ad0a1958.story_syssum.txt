Washington (CNN) -- Chinese President Hu Jintao wrapped up his U.S. visit Friday with a trip to Chicago, the hometown of his counterpart, U.S. President Barack Obama.
Earlier Thursday, Hu traveled to Capitol Hill, where congressional leaders used the occasion to raise strong concerns about Beijing's commitment to human rights and economic issues such as the protection of intellectual property.
We had "a good meeting," Boehner said.
On Wednesday, Hu met with Obama behind closed doors at the White House as top officials from both countries worked to address issues tied to the global economic crisis, international security, the environment and human rights.
The two leaders acknowledged continuing differences on human rights but pledged to keep working on the matter in a "frank and candid way," according to Obama.
Even when Hu spoke about human rights, it was blacked out.
China's currency, Obama said, remains undervalued -- a key factor in America's trade imbalance with Beijing.
