(CNN) -- An atheist sign criticizing Christianity that was erected alongside a Nativity scene was taken from the Legislative Building in Olympia, Washington, on Friday and later found in a ditch.
The sign, which celebrates the winter solstice, has had some residents and Christian organizations calling atheists Scrooges because they said it was attacking the celebration of Jesus Christ's birth.
The sign, which was at the Legislative Building at 6:30 a.m. PT, was gone by 7:30 a.m., Gaylor said.
Gaylor said that police are checking security cameras pointed at the building's entrances and exits to see if they can see anyone stealing the sign.
"My brother-in-law was huffing and puffing carrying it up the stairs.
Barker said the display is especially important given that 25 percent of Washington state residents are unaffiliated with religion or do not believe in God.
"Most people think December is for Christians and view our signs as an intrusion, when actually it's the other way around," he said.
The scene in Washington state is not unfamiliar.
the advertisement asks.
That ad has caused the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority to field hundreds of complaints, the group said, but it has heard just as much positive feedback, said Fred Edwords, the association's spokesman.
The ad campaign, Edwords said, is to make people think.
As far as the criticism goes, Edwords said there are far more controversial placards in Washington.
"If I can see a placard with dead fetuses on it, I think someone can look at our question and just think about it."
For some, the issue isn't even that the atheists are putting their thoughts on display, but rather the way in which they are doing it.
The atheist message was never intended to attack anyone, Barker said.
-- we respond that we kind of feel that the Christian message is the hate message," he said.
