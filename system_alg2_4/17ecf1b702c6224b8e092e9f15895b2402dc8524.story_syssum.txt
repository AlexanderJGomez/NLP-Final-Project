Today it's one of China's best-preserved destinations, thanks to the careful stewardship of its pagodas and pavilions, mountain-fringed West Lake, and terraced plantations growing the region's famous longjing green tea.
Hangzhou's latest entry this fall is also the city's first Western luxury hotel group: the Four Seasons Hotel Hangzhou (doubles from $372) will have hand-painted silk panels and such high-tech touches as plasma TV's in its 78 guest rooms and three villas.
A number of restaurants offer views of West Lake, but West Lake One (dinner for two $45) stands out with its covered terrace and extensive menu featuring dishes from throughout China.
Aside from its pagodas and picturesque landscapes, Hangzhou is also synonymous with longjing, a locally grown green tea prized for its light, sweet taste and aroma.
Tea fanatics might head to Old Dragon Well Imperial Tea Garden to pay homage to the 18 bushes set aside for the Ch'ing dynasty emperor Qianlong.
Close by, on the edge of the verdant, waterway-filled Xixi National Wetland Park, the National Wetland Museum (free admission) will open an Arata Isozaki --designed viewing platform later this year.
Getting There: Hangzhou is a 100-minute train ride from Shanghai; express trains launching next month will take 38 minutes.
