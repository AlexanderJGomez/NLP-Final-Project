Mizell traveled around Kandahar in a burqa -- the traditional attire of some Afghan women that covers them from head to toe.

Early this month, Mizell's father, George, issued an appeal to her kidnappers, pleading for his daughter's release in a statement.

"The main message I bring back is that Afghanistan is the forgotten war and Pakistan is the neglected frontier," Biden said at a Capitol Hill news conference.
