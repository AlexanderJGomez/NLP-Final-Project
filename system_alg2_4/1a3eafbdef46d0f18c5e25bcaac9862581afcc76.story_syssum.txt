(CNN) -- Israelis looking to know when to take cover are turning to their smartphones to get real-time notifications after Hamas fires rockets from Gaza.
Red Alert receives notifications when rockets are being launched from Gaza, and automatically sends out a push notification to users via the downloaded app.
Sprung works full time at a software development company, and tends to Red Alert in his free time.
Once the app is downloaded, users can select which Israeli cities for which they want to get alerts.
Before the latest Gaza operation, there were 60,000 Android users and 80,000 iPhone users, all in Israel.
"I know if it hits they won't be able to contact me immediately, so I want to be able to know to get in touch with them to make sure they're OK."
The time it takes for Israeli's to seek shelter varies, based on how far they are from the Gaza border.
Although I'm happy to be able to know when rockets fall, it's really sad to know we need something like this."
