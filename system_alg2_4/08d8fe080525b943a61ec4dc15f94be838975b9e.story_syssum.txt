(CNN) -- Khaldoon Khalifa Al Mubarak is CEO of Mubadala Development Company.
CNN's John Defterios met Mubarak in Abu Dhabi and began by asking him about Mubadala's recent purchase of a 7.5 percent stake in the U.S. investment firm, Carlyle Group for $1.35 billion.
Defterios: In the past we've talked about a return or a double-bottom line for Mubadala when you approach investments.
So it's a very good fit for us, it's a very good deal for Mubadala and I think it's the right step.
Mubarak: We've met with all the executives at Carlyle, we've looked at their track record.
You're moving at such a rapid speed in all directions at this stage.
Mubarak: It's been a tremendous roller coaster ride over the last couple of years, and the growth in Abu Dhabi, the growth in the region and the growth that Mubadala has gone through is tremendous.
I mean how do we know that's not just a vanity investment for Ferrari?
Mubarak: Well Ferrari has been a very exciting and interesting investment for us.
Two years later, we have a Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi.
Defterios: How do you avoid the eventual backlash here that seems to be brooding or percolating at this stage?
It's a totally different ball game than maybe 10 years ago or maybe 15 years ago, with the type of corporations and institutions that are now coming up in the region, and the approach they are taking in the investment strategies that they are pursuing.
It's a 23-year plan that looks at the growth of the city and makes sure that the growth of the city is in line with the aspirations of the government, with the aspirations of the people and in line with the type of developments that are being put forward from the real estate private sector and the industrial sector that is now growing at a pace that you don't see in many other places.
