(CNN) -- A Texas court granted a stay of execution for convicted murderer Henry "Hank" Skinner on Monday, giving Skinner time to pursue DNA testing his lawyers say could prove his innocence.
"Executing Mr. Skinner without testing all the relevant evidence would suggest official indifference to the possibility of error in this case and needlessly undermine public confidence in Texas's criminal justice system," former Texas Gov.
Owen requested a 30-day reprieve from Perry's office Monday afternoon, shortly before the appeals court issued its ruling, arguing that "substantial new evidence" has come to light since his trial to support Skinner's claim of innocence.
"Since the trial, I and many of my fellow jurors have grown increasingly concerned that key pieces of DNA evidence from the crime scene remain untested," the foreman, Danny Stewart, wrote.
"All the district attorney has got to do is turn over the evidence and test it, and let the chips fall where they may," Skinner told CNN's Kate Bolduan in 2009 in an interview from death row at the Polunsky Correctional Institution in Livingston, Texas.
Texas state attorneys argued at a recent court hearing that the testing should not be conducted because there was not a reasonable probability the trial jury would have found Skinner not guilty if the testing had been done for his trial, Owen said.
But Texas prosecutors have fought the testing, claiming that Skinner is not entitled to testing of evidence not analyzed before his 1995 trial.
Authorities followed a blood trail from the crime scene to the female friend's home and found Skinner in the closet, authorities said.
Some DNA testing was done, which implicated Skinner, but not on the items he now wants tested.
But they also have pressed state officials to do the forensic testing, saying it would end the years-long delay while Skinner has pressed his legal claims.
