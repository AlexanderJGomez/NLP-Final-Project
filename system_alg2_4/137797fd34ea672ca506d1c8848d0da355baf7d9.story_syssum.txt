The Florida Highway Patrol on Thursday released the audio recording of their interview of Wood's longtime neighbors who rushed out of their house in the early hours of last Friday to help Woods.
"It's Tiger, dial 911," Harris said her brother yelled after rushing outside.
" he said she asked.
Woods appeared to have a cut lip, but he wasn't bleeding much, Adams told the troopers.
It was a cool morning, so Adams and Harris covered Woods with a blanket and put pillows under his head, Adams said.
"He was actually snoring," he said.
Woods cited the injuries as the reason for his decision not to attend his own charity golf tournament this week.
