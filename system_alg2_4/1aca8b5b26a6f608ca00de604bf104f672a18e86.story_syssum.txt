(CNN) -- A Texas judge denied a Planned Parenthood request for a temporary restraining order Monday that would have extended the organization's ability to participate in the state's revamped Women's Health Program.
A full hearing is scheduled for January 11 before U.S. District Judge Stephen Yelenosky on whether to grant Planned Parenthood a temporary injunction.
With the temporary restraining order denial, women may not be able to access care through the Texas Women's Health Program at Planned Parenthood clinics, pending the result of the January 11 hearing.
"It is shocking that once again Texas officials are letting politics jeopardize health care access for women," said Ken S. Lambrecht, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas.
We only wish Texas politicians shared this commitment to Texas women, their health, and their wellbeing."
