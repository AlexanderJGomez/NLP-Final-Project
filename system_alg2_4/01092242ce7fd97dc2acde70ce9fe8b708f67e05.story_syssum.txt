(CNN) -- Comedian Joan Rivers is "resting comfortably" in a New York hospital after apparently suffering cardiac and respiratory arrest during a procedure at a medical clinic Thursday.
Rivers, 81, was taken by ambulance in critical condition to Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.
"This morning, Joan Rivers was taken to the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, where she is being attended to," hospital spokesman Sid Dinsay said in a statement.
Michael Lucas, who was in the audience for Rivers' show at New York's Beechman Theater Wednesday night, told CNN that she joked about death.
Rivers said on the show that doctors found a spot on an X-ray after she had a persistent cough.
"We're just not going to be sad about this," Rivers said during the episode.
She also admitted to not being as healthy as she could be.
"I wish I could say I eat super-healthy, but I don't.
