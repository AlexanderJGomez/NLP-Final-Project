The North American Aerospace Defense Command weather department says the streak of light that caused consternation from many most likely was part of a meteor shower.
Matthew Isaacs, from Mission Viejo, said he was driving when he saw the flash of light.
"I saw this big, greenish flash like, light up the sky.
I thought, 'Man, it must have been a meteor,'" Isaacs told KCBS.
