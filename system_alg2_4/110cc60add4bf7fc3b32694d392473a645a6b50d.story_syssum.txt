Also feared dead in the crash were two children -- ages 1 and 13 -- in one house, East Haven Mayor Joseph Maturo Jr. said.
Dannel Malloy said there could be as many as five people killed in the crash, including up to three people on the plane.
Maturo said the children were in one house with their mother when the plane struck shortly before 11:30 a.m.
The multi-engine Rockwell International Turbo Commander 690B, registered to Bill Henningsgaard, took off from New Jersey's Teterboro Airport on Friday morning and crashed while approaching the Tweed New Haven Airport around 11:25 a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration said.
One resident said the accident wasn't surprising.
"It's always a concern, but it's something that happens in every airport," Maturo said.
NTSB investigators will examine whether the weather played a role in the crash.
