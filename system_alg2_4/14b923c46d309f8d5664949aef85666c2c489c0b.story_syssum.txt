The horror that followed Tuesday at the Army Public School and Degree College in Peshawar, Pakistan, has shocked the world: 145 people dead, most of them children.
"My thigh was burning like metal -- I fell," the seventh-grader told CNN at Peshawar's Lady Reading Hospital where he was being treated for his injuries.
The ninth-grader told CNN that after a bullet hit his left shoulder, he lay under one of the benches in the room.
Muhammad Anas, 15, said that students in the auditorium were initially told that the sounds of bullets might be firecrackers.
He said that was when he got shot in his right shoulder.
"I saw a pair of big black boots coming towards me, this guy was probably hunting for students hiding beneath the benches," he told the French news agency.
"The man with big boots kept on looking for students and pumping bullets into their bodies," he told AFP.
I saw the dead body of our office assistant on fire," he said.
"I told the children to get off their school benches and go under the benches.
"Some children got up and then they were shot, after which the attackers left the room," he said.
"The men entered into the rooms one by one and started indiscriminately firing at the staff member and students," he told AFP.
Muhammad Arshad gave a sigh of relief after soldiers rescued his son Ehsan, The New York Times reported.
"My son was my dream," Ali told The Associated Press.
She was throwing herself against an ambulance at the Lady Reading Hospital, AFP said, one of many inconsolable parents.
