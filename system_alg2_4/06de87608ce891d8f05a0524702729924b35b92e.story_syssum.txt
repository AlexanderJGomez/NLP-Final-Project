(CNN) -- French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet traveled to Afghanistan to discuss security with local authorities, a spokesman said Saturday, a day after Allied forces suffered heavy losses in the country.
"The French army is not in Afghanistan to be shot at by Afghan soldiers," he said.
Also Saturday, the U.S. Department of Defense identified six Marines who were killed in Afghanistan when their helicopter crashed.
Two officers were also aboard the CH-53 helicopter: Capt.
Nathan R. McHone, 29, of Crystal Lake, Illinois.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen paid tribute to those killed and injured Friday, saying it was a "very sad day" for ISAF troops in Afghanistan and for France.
That is what Afghans want.
