(CNN) -- A year ago Wednesday, Malala Yousafzai was riding the bus home from school when a Taliban gunman climbed aboard and shot her in the head.
Her public fight to get that education and for the right of girls to get one, too, is what put her at odds with the Pakistani Taliban.
They banned girls from schools in the Swat Valley in 2009.
The Taliban have denied Malala was targeted for promoting education for girls.
"I'll tell him how important education is, and that I even want education for your children as well," she said Tuesday.
The driver hit the gas.
Doctors fought to save her life, then her condition took a dip.
Malala has kept the piece of skull that had been removed as a souvenir of her fight.
The U.N. started a global education program for girls called "I am Malala," the name she has chosen for her biography.
This year, the Malala Fund was created to support education for girls around the world.
