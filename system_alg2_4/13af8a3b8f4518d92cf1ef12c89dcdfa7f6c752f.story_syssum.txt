Moreover, there will be fewer people around to cover Cannes, as news organizations around the world trim costs.
Nevertheless, those who attend may see a bumper crop of good and intriguing films, Variety's Jay Weissberg told Reuters.
Leah Rozen, film critic for People magazine, said there are several promising contenders for the Palme d'Or, Cannes' top prize, as well as a number of notable movies premiering out of competition.
Tarantino told The New York Times that he's been hoping to do a war movie for years.
Cannes has been good to Tarantino; he won the Palme d'Or for "Pulp Fiction" 15 years ago.
"Taking Woodstock," the new film by "Brokeback Mountain" director Lee, is based on the book by Elliot Tiber, whose hotelier parents owned a musical festival permit in Bethel, New York, where Woodstock was held.
But this year's Cannes festival is attracting plenty of attention for its out-of-competition films as well.
Cannes, which also functions as a huge film marketplace, may widen the net in attracting distributors.
Recent winners of the Palme d'Or include 2000's "Dancer in the Dark," which established singer Bjork as an actress, and "4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days," a Romanian film that ended up topping many critics' lists in 2007.
