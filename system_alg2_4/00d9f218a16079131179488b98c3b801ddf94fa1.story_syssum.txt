Either way, South Korean defense officials said on Friday they were sure that they came from North Korea and that they were up to no good.
And they made it through South Korean air defenses.
Japanese-made digital cameras, which look like they could be of the consumer variety, were inserted into the bellies of the drones and had taken aerial photos of the South from around the border region.
There is little danger the drones could have made it far into South Korea.
"It has quite a small range, it doesn't have very long endurance so it would only be up there for a few hours.
The Korean drones are nowhere near as sophisticated as those used by the United States in Pakistan, Yemen and Afghanistan, he said.
North Korea has flaunted similar, larger UAVs at military parades in recent years, and some of them have been spiked with explosives, Hardy said.
Annual U.S.-South Korean joint military drills, that ended on April 7, drew criticism from North Korea, which views the exercises as "dress rehearsals for invasion," according to analyst James Person from the Woodrow Wilson Center.
The drones would fit well into that category, since they slipped through South Korean air defenses.
South Korea's defense ministry called the intrusion by the drones a violation of the truce that ended the bloody conflict between North and South Korea in 1953.
