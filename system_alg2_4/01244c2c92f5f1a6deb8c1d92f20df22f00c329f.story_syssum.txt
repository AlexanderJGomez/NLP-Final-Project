Retired Col. John Leech narrowly escaped death at the Pentagon on September 11, 2001.
Jack Punches: "Thanks Jack for serving and dying for our nation."

In 2001, Leech was working as a Defense Department liaison officer to the White House Drug Policy office.
As he walked the now-renovated halls where he spent the morning of September 11, he recalled the horror of the day.
Among the 184 people killed in the building and on the plane were a 3-year-old girl and a 71-year-old retired Navy captain, the youngest and oldest victims, who were both passengers on Flight 77.
Several people were killed or severely burned not far from where Leech took cover.

What little girl did that belong to?"
Seven years after that horrible day, Leech visited the chapel at the new Pentagon Memorial, a two-acre park, which opens to the public Thursday.
He wrote, "Thanks Jack for serving and dying for our nation -- John Leech."
A lot of very good people."
