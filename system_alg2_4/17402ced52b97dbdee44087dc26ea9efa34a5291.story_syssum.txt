Anneke van Woudenberg, senior researcher with Human Rights Watch, told Christiane Amanpour that 200,000 women and girls have been raped in Eastern Congo since 1998, and the condition of women has become more dire as the Congolese army has pressed a military campaign against armed groups in the countryside.
While the war formally ended six years ago, fighting persists in eastern Congo, and women are paying a high price.
It's protecting them from rape," van Woudenberg said.
There have also been reports of members of the Congolese army, particularly high ranking officers, attacking women.
"I think they've got to start holding to account the generals and colonels who are either themselves responsible or who allow their troops to rape.
In 2006, its parliament passed a law criminalizing rape, with penalties ranging from five to 20 years.
Jean-Marie Guehenno, the former head of U.N. peacekeeping, told Amanpour that the international forces face a serious problem: Too few troops assigned to the vast inaccessible reaches of eastern Congo.
"If one applied the counterinsurgency ratios that the U.S. Army thinks of -- say, 20 per 1,000 -- that would mean 200,000 troops in Congo -- 200,000 accountable troops."
"The violence in the Kivu, the violence in Ituri, it is the result of a vacuum, the fact that there is no administration, there is no credible state, there is no justice.
My hope is that the women and girls of -- of eastern Congo in particular -- will continue to speak out.
