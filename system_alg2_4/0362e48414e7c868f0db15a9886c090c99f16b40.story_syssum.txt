BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Chen Xiao had pretty much given up making her own decisions and so decided to throw open her life to the whims of China's hundreds of millions of Internet users, known in China as netizens.
It was very disappointing.
What she stumbled upon was not only a new life but a new way to make a living.
It can help give you a new sense of self-esteem," she said.
There was also a man who wanted to meet her for a few private hours at a ski chalet.
Chen does not know how much longer she will keep taking cyberrequests.
But I don't know what will come," she said.
