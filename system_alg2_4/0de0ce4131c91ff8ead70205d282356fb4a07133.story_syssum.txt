Kano's pits are said to date back 500 years and were once the center of a bustling Saharan trade in dyed cloth.
The pits are family owned and Abdu has trained his 21-year-old son to continue the tradition, but such dedication is rare.
"We are using the same ways dyers used when the pits began in 1498," explained Abdu.
Abdu hopes that with their custom the dye trade will continue, as it has for centuries, and that one day his son will be passing on the traditional techniques to his grandson.
