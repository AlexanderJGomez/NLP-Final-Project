(CNN) -- Coast Guard aircraft have found no sign of a spill from a Royal Dutch Shell oil drilling barge that ran aground off a southern Alaska island during a fierce winter storm, authorities reported Tuesday.
The Kulluk had been working in the Beaufort Sea, off Alaska's North Slope, until October.
Monday night, tug crews had to cut the rig loose during a storm that whipped up 24-foot waves, leading to its grounding.
The rig was aground in an area of Ocean Bay, where water depth is 32 feet to 48 feet.
As of Tuesday, "we have no indications of environmental or wildlife impact," Russell said.
Our people rely on our food," she said.
Climate researchers say that a decrease in sea ice is a symptom of a warming climate, caused largely by the combustion of carbon-rich fossil fuels.
