The trial is expected to start Monday.
Police said Condit was never a suspect in the case, although he was questioned intensively as investigators tried to find Levy, who vanished at the end of her federal internship at the U.S. Bureau of Prisons.
Years later, officials say, he admitted to fellow inmates that he had killed Levy.
Guandique denies that he committed the crime, and there is no physical evidence linking him to it, leaving prosecutors to base their case largely on his alleged jailhouse admission that he killed the young intern.
The judge's instructions and opening presentations in the trial are expected to begin Monday.
