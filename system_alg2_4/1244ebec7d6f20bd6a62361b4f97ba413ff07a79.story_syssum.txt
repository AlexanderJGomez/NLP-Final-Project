Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama and his South Korean counterpart hit the road together Friday, traveling to the heart of America's Rust Belt to tout a recently approved trade deal between Washington and Seoul.
The trade deal is "a win-win" for America and South Korea, Obama told a crowd of cheering workers at the plant.

"We believe in American ingenuity," Obama said Friday.
"Most importantly, we believe in American workers."
While trade has dominated the headlines during Lee's visit, Washington and Seoul also share a common concern over North Korea.
The two nations are also working together on climate change, economic issues through the G20 and a nuclear summit scheduled for next year in Seoul.
