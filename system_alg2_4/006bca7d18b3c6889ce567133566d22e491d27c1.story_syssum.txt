(CNN) -- The Chinese-French painter Zao Wou-ki once told me that painting expresses the thoughts we struggle to put into words.
Encouraged by the French-educated Chinese artist Lin Fengmian, his teacher at the prestigious Hangzhou National College of Art (today the China Academy of Art), he relocated to Paris in 1948.
For Zao and his contemporaries, Paris represented the source of modern art.
Zao worked hard to find his artistic voice.
In the decades that followed, Zao committed himself fully to abstract painting, rarely using even figurative titles after 1959.
The lyrical qualities that defined him as an artist appeared early on, first in his oil paintings and later in his ink paintings, after his reengagement with the medium in the early 1970s: oscillating planes of color, light, and shade met, collided, and diverged, skidding across the surface of his works.
No single phrase better encapsulates the union in his person and art of the two often disparate cultures and aesthetic visions of France and China.
"Zao Wou-ki," he mused, "his work isn't representative of either Chinese or French art."
"Yes," I answered.
