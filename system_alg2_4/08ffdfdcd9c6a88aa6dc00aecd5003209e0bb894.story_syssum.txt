(CNN)Talk show host Dr. Mehmet Oz is defending himself against a group of doctors who accuse him of "manifesting an egregious lack of integrity" in his TV and promotional work and who call his faculty position at Columbia University unacceptable.
I will address this on the show next week."
It all started when a group of 10 physicians from across the country emailed a letter to Columbia University expressing disapproval that Oz is on the faculty.
The doctors argue in their emailed letter that Oz shows "disdain for science and for evidence-based medicine, as well as baseless and relentless opposition to the genetic engineering of food crops."
The FDA disputed the findings and said the report was misleading and irresponsible.
Miller and the other doctors who signed the email echo that sentiment, saying Oz is misleading the public and they tell Columbia's Goldman that having him on the faculty is unacceptable.
Orlando, Florida, anesthesiologist Dr. Shelley Fleet told CNN when she received an email from Miller inviting her to sign the email to Columbia, she said of course.
He and Fleet share McCaskill's example of Oz's promotion of "miracle weight loss drugs" on the show as failure on Oz's part to follow the oath taken by doctors to do no harm.
Oz spokesman Tim Sullivan sent an email to CNN last week listing the names of five of the 10 people who complained about Oz.
The university has no position on what faculty members say in public discussion -- that is their individual academic freedom and is provided to them in the university's governing documents, he said.
Oz rose to fame after frequent appearances on "The Oprah Winfrey Show" led to the creation of his own show and magazine.
