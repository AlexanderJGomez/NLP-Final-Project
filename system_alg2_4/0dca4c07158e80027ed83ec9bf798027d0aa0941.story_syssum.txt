Construction on the city state's new structure for Changi Airport, the Jewel Changi, is underway.
More than simply a new terminal, Jewel Changi Airport will be constructed on the site of the old parking lot fronting the existing Changi Airport's Terminal 1, and will be "seamlessly connected" to the existing terminals, according to the airport.
On completion, it'll be the world's tallest indoor waterfall, according to the airport.
At night, the Rain Vortex will transform into a light and sound show.
Travelers will be able to stay at Jewel's own hotel -- approximately 130 rooms operated by international hotel brand YOTEL.
The airport expects a new Terminal 4 opening in 2017 for Cathay Pacific and Jewel in 2018 to bring 85 million passengers a year.
