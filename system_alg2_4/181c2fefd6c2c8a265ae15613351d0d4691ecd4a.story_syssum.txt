On June 1, she went to a friend of a friend's house party.
Soon, those photos spread on social media, with Twitter users mimicking her passed-out pose and adding the hashtag #jadapose.
Jada chose to show her face with the support of her mother, Sukiedia.
The teen began speaking to local and national media about the incident and took a photo with the hashtag #iamjada to reveal the real person behind the viral photos.
Jada isn't the only alleged assault victim moving to reclaim her name and image.
"With the case of Jada, the very technology that was used to make matters worse was used to improve matters," said Stephen Balkam, who has a teenage daughter and is CEO of the Family Online Safety Institute.
Social media users are adopting the #IamJada hashtag and posting photos of themselves with a fist raised in solidarity.
"Teens need to understand that their online behavior has lasting and permanent impacts," Jim Steyer, a father of four and CEO of Common Sense Media, wrote in an e-mail.
It's about creating a culture of empathy.

Resources on A Platform for Good can help guide conversations with teens about their digital reputation.
Having a dialogue with kids around acceptable online behavior can begin by talking about events in the news, such as #iamJada, or at school.
Parents "should encourage their kids to be up-standers and not bystanders when they see something as negative as what was happening to Jada," Balkam said.
"Yes, I feel like a heroine, because it takes courage to speak out and show your face, " she said.
