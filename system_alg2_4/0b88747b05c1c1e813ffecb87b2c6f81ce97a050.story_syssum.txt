Earlier this week, CNN spoke to four protesters about their hopes, demands and expectations, from a veteran demonstrator in Cairo who has marched in crowds since the beginning of Egypt's revolution in 2011 to a first-time protester in the port city of Alexandria.
[The] square exploded with joy once protesters knew that Morsy was no longer the president.
I was happy that Morsy was toppled, but I was concerned, too.
I would personally prefer that we achieve our goals and demands without any interference from the military.
Those in power [now] should stick to the demands of the people.
[The] people must keep a close watch on those in power and take action if there's any deviation from their demands and goals.
I went to [Tahrir] Square around 4 p.m., as I wanted to see how people would react to the speech.
This army made it clear, by choosing a civilian to lead the interim process ... that the masses of people would not revolt back at the army as before.
Also, education and gender equality should be a priority to empower youth and women -- two factors any economy depends on to progress.
They just protected the people's demands and put the country on the right track.
The people can do a lot to support their leaders -- they just need a guide, and the people will do miracles.
I'm one of the people who does not want the army to rule the country, so the interim president is the most suitable solution to avoid having the army ruling.
Whoever is in power now should prepare fast for presidential elections and complete the transitional period as early as possible.
