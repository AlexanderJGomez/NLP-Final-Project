Normally, the Atlantic would see its first hurricane by August 10, and a major hurricane (Category 3 or higher) by September 4.
2013's first hurricane -- Humberto -- was a month late.
Climate change?
--In the eastern Atlantic, where hurricanes are often born, African desert air is drying the moisture that hurricanes need to form.
"The forecast up to now is a bust," says Gray.
"Our forecast remains the same," weather service spokesman Chris Vaccaro said.
Then in August, it dialed down that initial forecast to predict 13 to 19 named storms, including six to nine hurricanes.
According to the weather service forecast, at least four more tropical storms or hurricanes will form in the next 11 weeks.
It would be a mistake to believe that the second half of any hurricane season would resemble the first half, says Vaccaro, who stresses that we're not experiencing a "lull."
-In 1998 one of the deadliest storms on record, Hurricane Mitch, raked the Caribbean and Central America after forming in late October.
-In 2002, Gustav, the first hurricane of the season, didn't occur until September.
How likely is it that the weather service forecast will pan out?
Globally the rating is a stunning 255, roughly half of what we should see this time of year.
--This year there is no El Niño, which would keep the season quiet, or La Niña, which would fuel a more active season.
--Climate change?
At the National Hurricane Center in Miami, they're comparing this year to "a slow first half of a slow football game," says hurricane center spokesman Dennis Feltgen.
"It really doesn't matter how many storms form out there," Feltgen says.
Be prepared.
"We'll figure it out," says Gray.
