The suit, known as the Garcia case, alleges Latino farmers were denied financial aid from 1981 to 2000 that white farmers were able to get.
The class could have included 20,000 farmers, the government said in court.
The Justice Department also is not interested in settling the case, government attorney Lisa Ann Olson told a federal district court judge in an August hearing.
The Latino farmers note that African-Americans who filed an identical discrimination lawsuit against the government in 1997 were granted class-action status and have been awarded about $1 billion in settlements to 15,000 farmers.
The farmers also point out that former Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman testified before Congress in 1997 that the USDA had a long history of discrimination.
It's all gone now.
