New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- In September of 2005, no one could have anticipated what we saw in New Orleans last week.
African-American candidates also won down-ballot races with majority white support, casting a blow to the notion that New Orleans politics and culture are mired in racial tension.
These judgments validate many locals' beliefs that the flooding of 80 percent of New Orleans and the billions of dollars in damage were caused more by massive engineering failures than a natural disaster.
One of the brightest spots in post-Katrina New Orleans has been in education.
All of this is not to say that everything is going perfectly in New Orleans.
But there is a unity of purpose (thanks in large part to the Saints) that wasn't there even six months ago.
Landrieu was elected in the primary (there will be no runoff) with 66 percent of the vote, including 63 percent of African-Americans and 70 percent of white voters.
Landrieu becomes the first white mayor to govern the majority-African-American city in some 30 years.
And in 2018, New Orleans' tricentenary will focus not only on the founding of New Orleans but also its successful rebirth 300 years later.
And as of late, it looks like it will be preserved.
But take a deeper glimpse beyond football at what's going on here.
New Orleans is storming back.
