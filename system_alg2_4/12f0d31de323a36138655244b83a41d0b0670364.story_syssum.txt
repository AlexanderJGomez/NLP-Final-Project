"Girls," the polarizing HBO comedy about four twentysomething women finding their way in 21st-century New York, received five nods Thursday when the nominations for the 64th Primetime Emmy Awards were announced.
Several veteran shows were among the nominees for best drama series, including "Mad Men" -- which has won this category four years running -- "Boardwalk Empire," "Breaking Bad" and "Game of Thrones."
Some have dismissed the show for its narrow take on New York and young women, noting the lack of African-American characters, its general hip and upscale settings, and Dunham's willingness to make her audience squirm as she follows characters into both bedroom and bathroom.
The show's defenders, on the other hand, applaud Dunham for showing her characters in less-than-flattering lights and observe that "Girls" isn't the first series to take place in a perceived vacuum.
NBC's "Parks and Recreation" missed out on best comedy series as well, though star Amy Poehler got a nomination.
Don Cheadle, whose Showtime series "House of Lies" received an uneven reception upon its January premiere, earned a nomination for best actor in a comedy series.
(Her comedy series, "Hot in Cleveland," also got recognition, with two nominations.)
The nominations were announced by Kerry Washington, star of ABC's "Scandal," and late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.
"Who are you wearing?"
The show will air on ABC from Los Angeles' Nokia Theatre.
