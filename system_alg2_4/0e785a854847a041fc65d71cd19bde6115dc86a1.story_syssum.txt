(WIRED)  -- Microsoft showed off a host of visual and search enhancements to its search engine Bing Wednesday, in hopes that better packaging will help it eat away at Google's online dominance.
Wednesday's announcements includes a new mobile app for Android and the iPhone, that brings some of the design feel of Windows Phone 7 to their competitors' devices, along with some nifty maps, real time bus directions, and an easy way to make beautiful panoramas.
The Movie page for that movie will, like those for in-theater movies, show you a preview and links to reviews.
But even better, he said, is that Bing is now gaining adherents, particularly younger users, who like its visual emphasis, use the site regularly and perhaps, most importantly, recommend it to other people.
Perhaps most importantly, Bing now has a partnership with Facebook, and one out of five Bing users are candidates for "instant personalization," since they are logged into Facebook and haven't chosen to opt-out.
"Even if only a small percentage of queries have moments where the social graph informs and improves search results, it's a huge difference," Nadella said, adding that it is only the beginning of using social sites like Facebook to improve search.
Since Google's design sense heavily relies on minimalism, that leaves lots of room for Microsoft (and its search partner Yahoo) to experiment with alternative, graphics-heavy designs.
Microsoft didn't announce anything today on par with Google's recent announcement of "Instant Search," a huge engineering feat that lets users see search results before even finishing typing their query.
