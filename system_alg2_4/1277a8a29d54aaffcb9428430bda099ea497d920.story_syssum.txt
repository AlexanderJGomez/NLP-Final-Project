(CNN) -- Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner will undergo surgery on Tuesday morning, days after doctors discovered she had a blood clot on the surface of her brain.
During Fernandez's absence, Vice President Amado Boudou is serving as Argentina's interim president.
In a televised speech Monday, Vice President Amado Boudou said the situation was similar to the time when Fernandez temporarily handed presidential powers over to him when she underwent surgery in January 2012 to remove her thyroid.
"There is no question or uncertainty, no strange question.
And that is what you will find the whole team of the president doing, governing."
