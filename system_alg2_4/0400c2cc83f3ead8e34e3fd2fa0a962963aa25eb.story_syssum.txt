Wygal first started gaining weight in her early teens.
A fast-food diet and little to no exercise helped her pack on the pounds, and her weight ballooned to over 200 pounds.
At first, Wygal was shocked and refused to begin a diet that she thought was too restrictive.

At first, Wygal says, she was too embarrassed to go to a gym, so she bought an elliptical machine and started working out 15 minutes a day in her apartment.
Several months later, Wygal was ready to take the next step.
Ready to take the next step, she joined a larger gym, began researching different workouts and got into weight training.
Wygal, who's 5 feet 10 inches tall, says the fear of gaining weight motivates her to stick to her diet and exercise regimen because she never wants to look like she did at 295 pounds.
