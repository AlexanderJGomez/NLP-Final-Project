The "House of Cards" creator, show runner and primary writer talks freely about his show, which concerns a powerful South Carolina congressman, Francis Underwood (Kevin Spacey), and his maneuvers to get his way in the conniving world of Washington.
Beau Willimon: I always keep my expectations pretty low.
But a number of my friends, including my best friend, Jay Carson, who is a political consultant on the show, were in the upper tiers and really knew what was going on.
It's dramatic, it's interesting, and I think it's something we can all identify with to a degree.
Willimon: Well, beyond the pale ethically for most people, sure.
It's a show about power.
CNN: Francis often says that he prefers power over money.
For some people the end goal is money.
They didn't.
Willimon: I don't consider myself to be a cynic nor the show to be cynical.
The problem with Washington right now is that people are too stuck to their ideology.
He says, I've got people over here who think this, and people over there who think that.
One of the comments we often get is people root for Francis because he actually gets things done.
Willimon: Sure.
CNN: I do find the sausage-making ugly.
I think he sees an intransigent belief system as a form of cowardice because it dictates your behavior for you.
I don't think that the media actually has the power to determine the course of history.
Willimon: It's sort of yes and no.
In terms of political figures, someone we keep going back to for inspiration is LBJ.
(But) I think there's so much to be gained by digging into this life story.
There you have someone who has such a singular vision and really stuck to it.
Are we going to see more in season 2?
You'll have to watch and see.
