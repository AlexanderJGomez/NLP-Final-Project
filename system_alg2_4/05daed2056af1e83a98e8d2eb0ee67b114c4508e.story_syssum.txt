By way of demonstration, she lines up three bottles on the table, next to a sample of three fonts: Comic Sans, Times New Roman and Helvetica.
As bizarre as it sounds, my job is to match up the bottles and fonts using only my sense of smell.
It was surprisingly easy.
"We've found that rounded fonts are commonly associated with deep reds and sweet tastes," she says.
To illustrate, Hyndman takes out another collection of props: candy bags with different fonts pinned to the outside.

For those interested to know more, Sarah Hyndman has launched a new series of "Tuesday Type Tastings" in London.
