Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki gave up the fight Thursday to keep his post, clearing the way for a new leader that many hope can hold Iraq together as the country battles brutal extremist fighters.
The move comes at a critical time in Iraq as Sunni fighters with the so-called Islamic State, formerly known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, force hundreds of thousands from their homes as they seize large swaths of land.
Calling it in an "honorable decision" by al-Maliki, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry urged al-Abadi to move quickly to form the government, saying it is essential to pulling the country's various ethnic and religious groups together to fight a common enemy in ISIS.
While Iraq works to seat a new government, Obama said in a televised address on Thursday that the United States will continue to conduct airstrikes to protect U.S. personnel and facilities.
At the same time, Obama urged Iraq's Shiite-dominated government to seize "the enormous opportunity of forming a new inclusive government" under al-Abadi.
The United Nations  estimates that more than 400,000 people have been driven from their homes since June, when ISIS swept across the border from Syria into Iraq.
Thousands of other refugees sought protection inside the northern Kurdish region of Iraq.
As of Thursday, there were about 15,000 Yazidi refugees from Iraq who arrived at the Newroz camp in Syria, the U.N. refugee agency said.
A senior commander said ISIS fighters abducted more than 100 Yazidi women and children from the community.
While CNN cannot independently confirm the claim, it follows reports by survivors who describe ISIS fighters grabbing families and separating the men from the women and children.
