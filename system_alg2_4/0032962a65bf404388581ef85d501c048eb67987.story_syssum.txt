Not for nothing was the name Nixon, Bush or Dole on the GOP presidential ticket from 1952 to 2004.
But a fresh-out-of-the-oven CNN presidential poll shows a fractured GOP field of newcomers with no clear front-runner while the Democrats have given an unprecedented lead to a brand name of their own: Hillary Clinton.
On the GOP side of the aisle, New Jersey Gov.
But that doesn't seem to be the case for Ryan, who emerged from the 2012 presidential race arguably damaged by his association with the Romney campaign.
Perhaps most interesting is the second tier of GOP candidates.
Far from being strengthened by their 2012 campaigns, these two candidates seem weakened by the experience.
Hillary Clinton has accumulated a towering 55 percentage point lead over her next closest competitor, Vice President Joe Biden, who is at 10% and doesn't exactly lack name recognition.
Six years ago, she was a far more polarizing figure among Democrats (and independents).
She will also be positioned as the candidate of the 51%, compelling to women of all ages and even possibly competitive among Republican women in this incarnation.
And Republicans are behaving like Democrats, putting forward a fractured field with no clear front-runners but elevating a New Jersey governor, a Wisconsin congressman and a Kentucky senator to the front of the pack.
