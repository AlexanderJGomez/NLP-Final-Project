The dog brought the skull back home in September and its owner contacted authorities, who have worked since then to determine if the remains were that of fugitive Kevin Patrick Stoeser.
DNA tests recently confirmed that.
Two months later, staff members allegedly caught Stoeser using a smart phone which had images of underage children, authorities said Monday.
No other remains have been found, they said.
Remains of another suspect featured on the "The Hunt" were also found earlier this year, and another suspect who was profiled on the show was killed in a gunbattle with authorities.
He died in a shootout in New York City as police closed in on him.
