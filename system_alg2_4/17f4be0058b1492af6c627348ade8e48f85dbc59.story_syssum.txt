Teachers and doctors in Buenos Aires went on strike Wednesday and are scheduled to go back to work Friday, the government-run Telam news agency and other outlets reported.
The doctors are not only seeking better salaries, but also improvements to the public health system.
"Provinces that have petroleum income, for example, are provinces that have better budgets, that have better hospitals" said Aldo Neri, a former national health minister.
Teachers also want greater pay and announced Thursday they would go back on strike Tuesday because of failed talks with Buenos Aires Education Director Mario Oporto.
Oporto said there's no money for raises now, the official Telam news agency reported.
They, too, want pay raises.
Educators also are on strike in neighboring Chile, where professors say they are owed a "historic debt."
