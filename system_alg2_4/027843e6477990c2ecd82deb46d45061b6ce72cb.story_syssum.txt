Some of the artifacts are so well preserved that the scientists can already retrace some of the battle lines.
For weeks, archeologist Petra Loenne and her team have been searching this area with metal detectors, pulling hundreds of ancient Roman weapons out of the ground.
The artifacts are so well preserved that the scientists can already retrace some of the battle lines.
Researchers say the evidence suggests the tribesmen lured the Romans into the forest to keep them from making full use of those long-range weapons and draw them into hand-to-hand combat, outside of the formations the imperial troops had mastered.
And Loenne said her team may have only begun to scratch the surface of the forest.
