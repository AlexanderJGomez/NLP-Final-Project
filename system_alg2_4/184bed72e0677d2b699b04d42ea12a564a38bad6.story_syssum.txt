"The Middle East likes to use words like 'iconic' and 'world class,'" says Anthony Mosellie, a managing principal at Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, the architecture firm in charge of the Abu Dhabi Midfield Terminal Complex design.
It will also alter the Abu Dhabi skyline.
Doha's impending Hamad International Airport will house the world's second longest runway, while Istanbul and Dubai are competing for the title of world's largest airport.
The Abu Dhabi terminal, for instance, will also house a museum to pique interest in the city's impending Louvre and Guggenheim additions.
Perhaps more telling than the various design features are the airports' planned capacities; combined, they will ultimately accommodate 450 million passengers a year -- a significant jump from the 140 million that currently make their way through the region.
The whole region has adopted an 'if-you-build-it-they-will-come' strategy.
The airports are part of a wider expansion scheme across the region.
Since its inception, Dubai International has seen its passenger numbers grow an average of 15% per year (roughly three times the global average).
By the end of the year, we should reach 66 million," says Riley.
Who knows?
Riley admits that there won't be room for two Dubai airports.
"We don't have a firm answer on that right now," Riley admits.
