(CNN) -- After actress Mackenzie Phillips spoke about her sexual relationship with her musician father, online and telephone calls to an anti-sexual assault hot line surged.
The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, which calls itself the nation's largest anti-sexual assault organization, said it had seen an 83 percent increase in activity on its online hot line and a 26 percent increase on its telephone hot line after Phillips' interview with Oprah Winfrey aired last week.
A U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics report found that of the 60,000 sexual assault cases reported in 12 states in 2000, about a quarter were perpetrated by family members.
At times, a victim may feel unable to tell other family members what's happening.
"Their sexual selves are damaged.
"
Although Phillips called the sexual relationship with her famed father, John Phillips, "wrong," she said, "I don't want bad things to happen to him, but I also don't want bad things to happen to me as a result of this.
Father- or stepfather-daughter incest is the most common form, although it also occurs between mother and child, according to the National Center for Victims of Crime.
Humans "have an instinct for avoiding incest or inbreeding," said Debra Lieberman, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Miami (Florida) who researches incest.
"It also depends on his other mating opportunities," Lieberman said.
"It doesn't make you broken," Phillips said.
"It doesn't make it so that you can't go on and be -- once you deal with honestly and realistically what you've been through, it doesn't mean that you can't be counted on or you can't be well enough to be a part of the world."
