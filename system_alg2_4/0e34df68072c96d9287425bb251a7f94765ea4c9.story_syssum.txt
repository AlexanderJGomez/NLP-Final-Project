(CNN) -- A grand jury has brought felony charges against three Dallas, Texas, police officers who were caught on patrol car dashboard cameras beating a motorcyclist after a chase, prosecutors said Thursday.
Randolph -- who was fired for failing probation after the incident -- was charged with official oppression and tampering with a governmental record, another felony.
Randolph beat Collins with his baton after Collins dropped to all fours, and Bauer began hitting and kicking him, police said.
They were seen on the second video also having contact with Collins, but they are not clearly seen because Duetsch had turned the camera away from the beating, Dallas Police Chief David Brown said earlier this month.
After seeing the video, police dropped the resisting arrest charge.
