So when I learned CNN's Talk Asia had booked the Beach Boys for an interview in Hong Kong, I jumped at the chance to interview Al Jardine, Mike Love and Brian Wilson.
Although their new song is about a technology the band is nostalgic about, the Beach Boys are not stuck in the past.
And they're still capturing the sweet, adolescent purity of "Surfer Girl."
"The night we cut the vocals was one of the highlights of my life," says Wilson.
Wilson tells me the production took little more than a month.
As Wilson puts it, "My brother Carl said, 'Why don't you use a theremin?'
"I came up with the 'Uooooooooooooooo' (he mimics the theremin sound).
"They are all masterpieces," says Love of the Beach Boys' full playlist.
Half a century on, the Beach Boys are still creating new music that captures the emotional thrills of youth.
And then it hits me, I'm being serenaded by The Beach Boys.
And why not?
He has to feed the muse.
