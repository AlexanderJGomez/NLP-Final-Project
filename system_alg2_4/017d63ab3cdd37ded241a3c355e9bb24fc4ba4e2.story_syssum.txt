Doctors were set to operate on President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner at Austral Hospital, located about 60 kilometers (35 miles) outside Buenos Aires, the state-run Telam news agency reported.
Recent medical tests uncovered papillary carcinoma in Fernandez's thyroid gland, presidential spokesman Alfredo Scoccimarro said last week.
Fernandez, 58, was sworn in for a second four-year term last month after she won re-election with more than 54% of the vote.
Papillary carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer and has a high survival rate, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.
Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2010.
He did not specify what kind of cancer he had, but after undergoing several rounds of chemotherapy, he said in October that he had been cured.
