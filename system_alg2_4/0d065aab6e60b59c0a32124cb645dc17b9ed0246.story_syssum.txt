The problems of very long wait lists for veterans and serious scheduling issues go well beyond Phoenix and exist in many VA facilities, Inspector General Richard Griffin and members of his staff told the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee.
Despite increased oversight, hundreds of thousands of veterans may still remain on wait lists, according to Tuesday's testimony.
The VA system might need as many as 28,000 doctors and other medical staff to help fix the problems and provide proper and timely care to veterans, said McDonald, who also testified.
That report found 28 veterans who suffered "clinically significant delays in care associated with access to care or patient scheduling."
The report reviewed the cases of more than 3,400 patients and found 28 instances of clinically significant delays in care associated with access or scheduling.
"This report cannot capture the personal disappointment, frustration and loss of faith individual veterans and their family members had in the health care system that often could not respond to their mental and physical health needs in a timely manner," said Griffin.
"And we're pursuing those."
McDonald said that as of August 15, the Veterans Health Administration had contacted more than 294,000 veterans and had decreased the electronic wait list nationwide by 57%.
A new recruiting push by the VA was underway, McDonald said.
"And if you're the VA, this is the line you want inserted in that report."
"There are many versions of a draft report," Griffin replied.
McDonald testified to numerous efforts underway across the VA system to decrease wait times and provide veterans faster, needed medical care.
