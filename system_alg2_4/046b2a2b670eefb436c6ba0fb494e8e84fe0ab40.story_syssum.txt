Some iPhone 5 users are complaining that a burst of purple is showing up in their photos -- and Apple seems to be acknowledging it's just part of how the camera works.
"I've taken 20,000+ photos on my 4S, never ONCE had this problem."
He claims Apple support staff first said the discoloration shouldn't be happening but shifted after talking to Apple engineers.
Some of the 5's images had a purple glow around light sources, while others didn't, Mashable reported.
"The new iSight camera in iPhone 5 features a sapphire crystal lens cover that is thinner and more durable than standard glass with the ability to provide crystal clear images," Apple wrote in promotional material for the phone.
The problems -- landmarks misplaced or misnamed, huge swaths of major cities missing -- prompted Apple CEO Tim Cook to offer a rare apology, promising that it will be fixed and going so far as to suggest other apps in the meantime.
