Speaking at the TED Global conference, Assange said that "we are overwhelmed by our growth" and the site can't keep up with the volume of the new material because it doesn't have enough people to verify it.
He has been accused of "wrongfully introducing a classified video of a military operation filmed at or near Baghdad, Iraq" around July 12, 2007, "onto his personal computer, a non-secure information system."
He said WikiLeaks is providing legal assistance to Manning without saying if he was the source of the video.
The site said the video "clearly shows the unprovoked slaying of a wounded Reuters employee and his rescuers."
At the Oxford event, Assange said, "Remember the people in Baghdad, the people in Iraq, the people in Afghanistan, they don't need to see the video.
Assange said some information, including a patient's medical records, should legitimately be kept secret.
"I received advice from figures like [investigative reporter] Sy Hersh to exercise caution," Assange said, adding that U.S. officials have now adopted a "reasonable" attitude in private.
He asked the audience for a show of hands as to whether he was a hero or a "dangerous troublemaker."
