(WIRED) -- In an effort to streamline and simplify the maturity ratings of software in mobile app stores, CTIA, the international wireless industry association, yesterday proposed a ratings system that store owners could voluntarily adopt.
In the Android Market, Google assigns content ratings that range from "Everyone" to "Low Maturity" to "High Maturity," but provides no details on the specific content that inspired its ratings.
The CTIA's guidelines aim to score smartphone and tablet apps on a five-point scale based on their violence and sexual content.
CTIA announced it would be developing its app rating system in March.
Apps would receive their rating almost instantaneously, and if a developer disagreed with the assigned rating, it could appeal it.
