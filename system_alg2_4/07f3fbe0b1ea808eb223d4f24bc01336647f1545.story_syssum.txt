Alleged cartel hit man Eduardo Ravelo has been added to the FBI's most wanted list.
He heads the Barrio Aztecas gang, but Ravelo isn't flashy, FBI agents say.
Officially, he's wanted on federal racketeering charges, but the FBI says Ravelo's criminal activities run much deeper.
He's also called "Two-by-four" and is believed to be  hiding with his wife and children, probably in a Barrio Aztecas-controlled neighborhood in Juarez, Mexico, just across the border from El Paso, Texas.
"Eduardo Ravelo rose to power within the Barrio Aztecas criminal enterprise because of his connections with the Juarez cartel and also [because] he's a ruthless killer and will basically carry out what the Juarez cartel wants him to do," Mikeska said.
U.S. authorities say the commanders of the Juarez cartel often call on Ravelo to execute their enemies.
FBI investigators say they believe that in March 2008, Ravelo carried out a hit on a captain in his own gang.
In recent years, federal agents have arrested dozens of Barrio Aztecas' 3,500 members, with six of its leaders sentenced to life in prison.
"He has an entourage, he has bodyguards, he has armored vehicles to protect him from rival gangs and rival cartels," Mikeska says.
