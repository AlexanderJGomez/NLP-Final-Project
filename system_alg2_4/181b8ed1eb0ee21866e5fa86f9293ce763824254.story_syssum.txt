CNN -- Donny Osmond was the Justin Bieber of his day.
Donny and Marie Osmond are guests on Monday's "Piers Morgan Tonight."
I look at Justin Bieber ... and my heart breaks for him, because I know what he's going to go through.
Donny went on to say that Bieber is "going to go through so much heartache, 'Baby, baby, baby.
"They didn't look at it as being a celebrity," Marie said.
And that's what I learned from Sammy Davis Jr., from Frank Sinatra, is when you went to ... those shows, you got to know them."
Presley came to visit him in his dressing room the following evening, Donny said, and politely said "'Hi, everybody.
"The king of rock and roll just walked through the door, and he's a real person," said Donny.
When you go onstage, you're just another person."
Marie said that when she broke the news of the engagement to her son, he hadn't been aware his parents were even dating.
It's out.
...
The couple married in Las Vegas, and Marie chose the birthday shared by her mother, Olive Osmond, who died in 2004, and her son Michael, who committed suicide last year.
"There's always a place that is set in your heart at the dinner table," said Marie.
