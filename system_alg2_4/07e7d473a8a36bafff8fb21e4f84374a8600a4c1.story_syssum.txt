Gilberto Valle, who has already served 21 months in jail and faced life in prison on the kidnap conspiracy conviction, did not say a word when he appeared in a federal courtroom Tuesday.
Defense attorney Julia Gatto said the decision backed up her assertion that Valle is "guilty of nothing more than very unconventional thoughts ... We don't put people in jail for their thoughts.
U.S. District Court Judge Paul Gardephe also ordered GPS home monitoring for the defendant.
The database, which Valle was trained to use and had access to as a police officer, helped him research potential victims, prosecutors said.
Valle, a six-year NYPD veteran, was convicted after prosecutors presented evidence such as a document found on his wife's laptop titled "Abducting and Cooking Kimberly -- A Blueprint."
According to trial evidence, he communicated online with three co-conspirators on the Dark Fetish Network, prosecutors said.
