Locals like to take a cold dip after a sauna at Ribersborgs Kallbadhus.
If you opt for a taxi, be sure to set the price of the trip with the driver before setting off.
A better time to visit for the less adventurous is in the summer, when the baths are open for sunbathing.
Living green  As part of its post-industrial transformation, Malmo has become a leader in environmental design.
Around the Sound  Malmo is located just 35 minutes by train from the Danish capital of Copenhagen, and every day thousands travel between the two cities via the Oresund Bridge.
The best way to explore the Oresund region is with an "Around the Sound" ticket, which gives you access to all the trains you need to travel around the area, including the ride across the Oresund Bridge.
Feasting on crayfish  Swedes are crazy about crayfish, and outdoor festivities celebrating the crustacean are held across the nation to mark the end of summer.
To really get into the tradition, wash down the crayfish with akvavit, a Scandinavian kind of vodka.
