City manager Mark Hughes told the club's official Web site that Robinho, who cost mega-rich City a British record fee of Â£32.5 million ($45m) when he signed from Real Madrid in August, will be spoken to after not joining the rest of the squad in a Tenerife training camp this week -- choosing instead to fly to Brazil to attend to a family matter.
"Once he is back, I will sit down with him and explain my feelings, and decisions will be made after that.
Then we will move on.
Robinho is no stranger to controversy and had a reputation as a party-goer prior to his move to Manchester last year.
