London, England (CNN) -- Forty years ago London's docklands were an industrial wasteland.
"It will be a mini Monaco," Benjamin Sutton from concierge service MGMT told CNN.
"We have preferential tickets to first class events like track and field.
Berths are roughly £60 ($90) a meter per day, with a 70-meter superyacht setting you back a whopping £58,000 ($90,000) for two weeks of the Games.
Among the wealthy expected at Wood Wharf, Canary Wharf, St Katharine Docks and Royal Victoria Dock in east London are Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich.
And when the superyacht owners come out to play, nearby restaurant and club Waterside House will be offering them the exclusive, high-end entertainment they've come to expect.
We've got Olympic contestants, oligarchs, ambassadors, celebrities and CEOs of some of the largest companies in the world.
They're all billionaires and there's only a certain amount of time they can spend on their boat."
And it wasn't until the London Docklands Development Corporation redeveloped the site in the late 1980s -- including the financial hub of Canary Wharf -- that the docklands was reborn.
The Olympic makeover is the latest development for this historic East End heartland -- one which Benjamin predicts could give it a lasting reputation.
