When Russian officials tried to trick the public by passing off old photos as new appearances, speculation about Putin's whereabouts went viral.
The Kremlin has now started pushing harder against the rumors, trying to prove that Russia's foremost -- nay, only -- major political leader, is alive and well.
Early on Friday, officials released what they said was a picture of Putin taken the day of.
This whole thing started after Putin's trip to Kazakhstan was canceled on Wednesday and a Kazakh official told a reporter that the Russian President had fallen ill. Then the Kremlin released a picture of Putin speaking with the leader of the Republic of Karelia.
The Swiss magazine Blick said Putin is in Lugano, where his girlfriend just gave birth to their baby.
Does Putin ever catch a cold?
Putin is not your average president.
Putin is the state.
His approval ratings are stratospheric, even if his brazen policies would warrant more significant levels of disagreement.
The recent murder of Boris Nemtsov, Putin's foremost critic, has spawned fears that there is a hit list, a roster of Putin critics whose days are numbered.
And in the post-Stalin days, the passing of one leader meant that the party chose the next strongman.
The next day, the Russian people were told that Gorbachev was ill, and could not perform his duties.
Even if Putin is in perfect health and the social media whirlwind turns out to have just been an outlet for creativity, talk of Putin's disappearance raises important questions.
What would Russia become if he suddenly left power?
Whatever Putin is doing at this exact moment -- whether he is hunting tigers, visiting with friends, or convalescing from an illness -- and no matter what he does in the days ahead, the Internet tempest of the past few days is a reminder that the man who embodies today's Russian state, who dismantled the country's once-fledgling democracy, won't be around forever.
