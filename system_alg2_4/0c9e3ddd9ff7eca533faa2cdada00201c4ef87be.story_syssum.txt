The 2014 World Cup qualifying tie will be the first time the two teams have played each other since the break up of the former Yugoslavia and then the Croatian War of Independence, which raged between 1991 and 1995.
"I implore the Croatian fans to back us with their love for the national team and not hatred for our opponents," Stimac, who picked up 53 caps for Croatia between 1990 and 2002, told reporters ahead of the match.
Like Stimac, Serbia coach Sinisa Mihajlovic wants his players to inspire passionate support from their fans.
Both Mihajlovic and Stimac played when Croatia and Yugoslavia were drawn together in the qualifying tournament for Euro 2000.
"The stadium in Zagreb was like a volcano," recalls Mihajlovic, who played in the match, while Stimac missed out.
These days about one third of Vukovar's population is made up of Serbs, though the two ethnic groups remain segregated.
"Every time I went up to take a free-kick or a corner, tension was high," continued Mihajlovic, as he recalled more memories from that Zagreb game in 1990.
Friday's game will serve as a barometer for the mood of fans, with those who remember the conflict and those too young to have witnessed the fighting being brought together.
"It is a little different now.
For them this is a game.
Both Stimac and Mihajlovic called for calm ahead of the contest and will be expected to set a dignified tone on Friday, but the two coaches did not always see eye-to-eye during their playing careers.
They both got sent off bad mouthing each other.
