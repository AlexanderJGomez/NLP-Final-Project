(CNN) -- It seems like the opposite of what you'd expect, but my cancer diagnosis -- a staggering Stage IV colon cancer diagnosis, delivered to me at the age of 28 -- gave me a new lease on life.
I was ready to fight this disease head-on and show myself -- and everyone else -- what I was made of.
And it has.
Just months after my diagnosis, I made the jump to strict veganism.
I manage stress levels and I make sure I always get enough sleep.
Becoming sick was the way I learned how to be well.
My fellow patients are more than just friends.
That's because they are.
A simple but revolutionary initiative that sees every penny donated going to cutting-edge research that I hope will get us to the cure for colon cancer in under 10 years.
The cure.
If you had all the money in the world, could you cure colon cancer?
Lenz and his dream team -- scientists and researchers from the United States and abroad -- are sure that they can find the cure for colon cancer if they have the funds to do the necessary large-scale research and drug development that the team has long been known for.
It sounds like an impossible goal -- to find the cure for cancer -- but it is possible.
And through The Wunder Project, I know it will be.
