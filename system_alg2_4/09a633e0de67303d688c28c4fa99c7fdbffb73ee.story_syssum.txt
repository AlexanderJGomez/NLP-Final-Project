(CNN) -- When the Boy Scouts of America found out den leader Jennifer Tyrrell is a lesbian, the organization's Ohio River Valley Council sent her a letter saying "you must immediately sever any relationship you may have" with the Scouts.
The 103-year-old organization -- known for its worthwhile efforts to teach kids to tie knots, survive in the woods and become more civic-minded adults -- decided on Thursday that gay Scouts should be able to participate in the organization.
The group's attitudes on gay rights are "more out of style than the scout socks," said Kelsey Timmerman, a former Eagle Scout who mailed his badge back to the organization because of its discriminatory policies.
"Scouting was awesome," he said.
Her son Cruz would love to be able to participate in the Scouts again, she said.
She noticed improvements in his maturity and confidence when he was part of the group.
Hundreds of thousands of people had petitioned the Scouts to allow gay kids to participate.
I am certainly thankful the Boy Scouts did decide to allow all openly gay kids to be members.
For one thing, it's illogical.
The problem may be that the Scouts are listening too much instead of making decisions with conviction.
The anti-gay Family Research Council recently uploaded a YouTube video (watch it; this sort of over-produced fear-mongering has become a hilarious parody of itself) saying that the Boy Scouts were "abandoning their moral compass" by thinking of including gay Scouts.
