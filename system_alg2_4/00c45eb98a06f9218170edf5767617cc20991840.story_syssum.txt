The cowardly and reprehensible shooting Wednesday night of two police officers came in a tumultuous seven days for the Missouri town, which had already seen Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson announce his resignation after a damning Justice Department report on its police department.
And tensions are being exacerbated by the use among police departments of military weapons, and stipulations that these former war zone weapons must be used within a year of acquisition.
All this suggests a need for a completely new mindset on how we try to understand and implement policing practices across America.
When the weapons of war come home from Iraq and Afghanistan to help police America's cities and towns, then you know something has gone terribly wrong with this country.
Mine-resistant ambush protected vehicles, tanks, drones, grenades and assault weapons should not replace the community policing of our Main Streets.
Yet until such a bill is passed, war weapons will continue to flood our streets; Congress must act to stem this tide.
In fact, the opposite happens.
If we don't press our police departments to reflect the makeup and needs of our communities, then towns like Ferguson will unravel further.
