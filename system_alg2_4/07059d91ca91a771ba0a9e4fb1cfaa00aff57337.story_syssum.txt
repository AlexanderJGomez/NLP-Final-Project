(CNN)I like to think I'm a pretty optimistic person.
Even today, more than half the counties in the state are refusing to issue licenses to gay couples.
I'm not a trained lawyer, but the logic seems to be that the refusal to treat people like slaves under the law is similar to the refusal to grant gay and lesbians their equal rights to marry under the law.
Me?
But, after Bush v. Gore, Citizens United, and Shelby v. Holder, the case gutting the 1965 Voting Rights Act in 2013, sometimes it seems like the voices of the American people don't get heard by those nine Justices.
The idea behind the People's Brief is an original twist on the legal concept of the "amicus curiae" (Latin for "friend of the court.")
The People's Brief marks the first time that the American people -- the 58% of Americans who support marriage equality, anyway -- can make their voices heard in an official brief to those justices.
I think that's pretty forward-thinking for a Court that still doesn't allow cameras or online case filings.
I've signed my name to the People's Brief, and I hope Americans from all backgrounds will do the same or just try to learn more about marriage equality.
It's time to put your name on the right side of history.
