London (CNN) -- Two men went on trial Friday accused of the "cowardly and callous murder" of British soldier Lee Rigby, who was hacked to death in a London street.
"The only reason we've killed this man today is because Muslims are dying daily by British soldiers," he said.
Leave our lands and you will live in peace."
The court was shown surveillance video of the car crossing to the wrong side of the road before it hit him, and Rigby rolling onto the hood of the car.
Footage from a different surveillance camera showed two men dragging the soldier's limp body from the sidewalk into the middle of the road.
One woman stroked Rigby's body in a gesture of comfort, he said, while another engaged Adebolajo in conversation despite the fact that he was still holding the meat cleaver in his blood-covered hands.
When police arrived at the scene, the two men moved toward their vehicle, Whittam said.
While the gun carried by Adebowale was not loaded, he also had on him the bloodstained knife he'd used to attack Rigby, the prosecutor said.
The prosecutor also told the court how the firearms officers had to react within moments as they arrived at the scene.
I did it for my God.
Jurors were also shown pictures of the bloodied weapons allegedly used by the two men.
Some family members left crying as images were shown of the soldier shortly before the attack, as he left the public transit system in Woolwich.
The car allegedly used by the suspects was also caught on surveillance video maneuvering in the vicinity of the street where Rigby was attacked later that day.
