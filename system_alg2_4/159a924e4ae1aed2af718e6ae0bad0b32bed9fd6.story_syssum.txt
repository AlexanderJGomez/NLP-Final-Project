As many as 200 girls were abducted from their boarding school in northeastern Nigeria by heavily armed Boko Haram Islamists who arrived in trucks, vans and buses, officials and witnesses said.
"Many girls were abducted by the rampaging gunmen who stormed the school in a convoy of vehicles," said Emmanuel Sam, an education official in Chibok.
They left with us in a convoy into the bush," said the student, who declined to be named for security reasons.
At one point, one of the trucks broke down and the girls on that vehicle were transferred to another one, the student said.
In early March, Borno state government closed all of its 85 secondary schools and sent more than 120,000 students home following increasing Boko Haram attacks on schools.
