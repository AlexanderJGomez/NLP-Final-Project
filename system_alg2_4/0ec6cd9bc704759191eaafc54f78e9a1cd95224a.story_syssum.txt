(CNN) -- Nationalists held a narrow lead in Kyrgyzstan's parliamentary elections, the country's election commission said Monday.
International monitors did not report any major complaints on election day, though local observers from the political parties were more vocal with their concerns, Sooromkulova said.
Voter turnout was high, especially in the south of the country, she said, including a 56 percent turnout in the capital, Bishkek.
Nearly 2.9 million people were eligible to vote for 120 lawmakers in a parliament called the Jogorku Kenesh, the Central Election Commission said.
