"Rudo y Cursi" reunites Luna and Bernal, who became pin-ups for the resurgence in Mexican filmmaking with "Y tu Mama Tambien" in 2001.
Cha Cha Cha was established by Mexico's three leading directors who are also renowned internationally -- Carlos' brother Alfonso Cuaron ("Children of Men"), Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu ("Babel") and Guillermo del Toro ("Pan's Labyrinth").
"But I told this idea to Gael [Garcia Bernal] and Diego [Luna], and they both said they wanted to play the part.
Both had originally wanted to play the opposite character: Bernal the abrasive Rudo, and Luna the romantic Cursi.
The idea behind Cha Cha Cha films was conceived by Cuaron senior, del Toro and Innaritu when the trio -- a kind of all-stars of Mexican cinema -- found themselves with a surprise 16 nominations and 4 awards at the 2007 Oscars.
When Carlos was originally writing the script, his bother, Alfonso told him thought it was perfect for Cha Cha Cha.

"Just good or bad movies.
"People talk about this film as if it's a comedy but I question that," says Alfonso.
Nobody else sees them."
"No, not my mother," says the director.
