Benghazi, Libya (CNN) -- Hip-hop artists don't often smile, so it was no surprise that Libyan rapper MC Swat scowled suspiciously when I first walked into his cramped, cigarette smoke-filled studio in a former government building in Benghazi.
When asked what would happen if he rapped his anti-regime lyrics prior to Libya's uprising, MC Swat said, "I would be shot to death like Tupac," referring to the American rapper killed in 1996.
The building's hallways are covered with art and anti-regime cartoons, and the rooms are often buzzing through the wee hours of the morning with dozens of young revolutionary artists at work.
"When you get in this building, you're going to find yourself in another world," said Marrawan Gargoun, the lead singer for Guys Underground.
"It feels like we're touching freedom," said MC Swat, who often sleeps overnight in his studio.
They're not al Qaeda."
