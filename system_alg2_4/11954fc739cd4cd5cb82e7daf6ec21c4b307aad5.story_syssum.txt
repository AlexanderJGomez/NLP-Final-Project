LONDON, England (CNN) -- London police said Thursday they are planning one of the largest and most complex operations in their history as the city gears up to host the G-20 summit next week.
Police forces from surrounding counties like Essex and Sussex are also assisting with security, he said.
O'Brien would not say how many police officers would be on duty, but he said there were 10,500 police shifts being scheduled between March 24 and April 2.
The one-day summit is already attracting a "significant amount of interest" from protest groups, O'Brien said.
Police expect some 20,000 people to turn out, O'Brien said.
April 1, the day before the summit, will see various smaller demonstrations in central London.
"We will not tolerate any people breaking the law, attacking buildings, people, or our officers," he said.
O'Brien said only that police were prepared for a "range of instances."
"We are aware of the situation and we'll have appropriate security measures in place," a company spokeswoman told CNN.
"We're up for it and we're up to it."
