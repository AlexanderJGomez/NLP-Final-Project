For a long time it feels like we haven't seen much of Ronald McDonald.

"Hey kids, look at the funny clown.

"Hey kids, look at the funny clown.
A little diabetes never hurt anyone.
So, a major part of the big rollout was some new, updated clothes.
That said, it's entirely possible that the marketing team simply threw Ann in a car and drove HER down to Old Navy, because Ronald's new getup includes cargo pants and a technical vest, as well as a red and white striped long-sleeve rugby shirt.
Though, in all fairness, it looks OK.
When McDonald's revealed Ronald 2014 to the world this week, the company also shared a new mission: Fun makes great things happen.
And it's true.
Beyond his updated clothes and new personal mission handed down from the Filet-O-Fish gods, what's most fun about this whole new and improved Ronald is that now he's even taking on social media.
While Ronald won't actually have his own personal Twitter handle, he has been authorized to use his full name as a hashtag, marking the first time he's taken an active part in the company's social media strategy.
Two words.
