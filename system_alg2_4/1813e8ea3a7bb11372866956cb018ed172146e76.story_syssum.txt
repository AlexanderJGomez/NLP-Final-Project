(CNN) -- Tomatoes are again safe to eat, the Food and Drug Administration said Thursday, weeks after the food was blamed as a source of a salmonella outbreak in the United States and Canada.
Two elderly men with pre-existing conditions died while infected with Salmonella Saintpaul, and the FDA said the infection could have contributed to their deaths.
Many of the infected people were thought to have eaten tomatoes from farms in south Florida and parts of Mexico, but inspectors haven't found the outbreak strain on those farms, Acheson said, according to the AP.
The FDA has said that because raw jalape√±o and serrano peppers may be linked to the outbreak, people at risk for developing severe infections -- infants, elderly people and people with compromised immune systems -- should avoid eating them.
