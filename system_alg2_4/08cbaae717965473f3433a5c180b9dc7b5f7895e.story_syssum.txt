No one died on impact but 32 lives were lost during the subsequent chaotic evacuation of the 4,200 people on board the ship.
Over the past two years, the judges in the captain's trial have heard from a wide variety of people, including passengers, crew members and technical experts.
However, he said earlier the rocks were uncharted, and he did everything he could to preserve the lives of crew and passengers.
"Everything about this ship and this process since then has been a mystery so far," he said.
Cemortan boarded the ship as a passenger but had worked on another Costa Cruises ship captained by Schettino a few weeks earlier.
Costa chairman Pier Luigi Foschi, who retired after the disaster, had said Schettino had never been involved in an accident before.
Schettino is also accused of abandoning his passengers, who were unable to look after themselves, and to whom he had a responsibility as captain, when he left the ship before they did.
He used a graphic to illustrate the inclination of the ship at the time Schettino apparently lost his balance and fell into the lifeboat that took him to shore.
But as the official questions his decision, Schettino appears to reverse course and says he did not abandon ship but was "catapulted into the water" after the ship ran into a rock, began taking on water and started listing.
As the night unfolds, the coast guard commander repeatedly questions why Schettino, as captain, is not on the ship when passengers are still aboard.
