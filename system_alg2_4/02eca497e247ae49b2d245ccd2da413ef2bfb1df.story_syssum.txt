We know Kyle sensed tension as he and Littlefield drove the former U.S. Marine to a gun range for an afternoon of bonding and helping Routh cope with what his family members believed was post-traumatic stress disorder.
Kyle was shot four times in the back and once in the face.
Littlefield was shot five times in the back.
"It is my opinion that he was suffering from a severe mental disease or defect that caused him not to know his conduct was wrong," Dunn testified.
I don't know what's even sane in the world right now."
Cole testified he heard Routh talk about the shootings four months after the tragedy.
They were just taking me to the range so I shot them.
"That's how I felt that day," Routh said on the recording.
I guess it was love and hate, you know.
Later in the phone call, Routh complained that Kyle and Littlefield stopped to feed him at a fast-food restaurant on the way to the range.
Routh said that when the men started shooting pistols at the gun range, he saw it as a showdown.
"
" Routh said.
It's a shooting sport.
Judge Jason Cashon immediately sentenced him to life in prison without parole.
