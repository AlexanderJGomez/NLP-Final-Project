"I realized I can give them a camera and hopefully that will impact their lives -- just like the way camera has impacted my life when I received a camera from my mentor," Khazem, now 26, told CNN via Skype.

"I love being a photographer who can show the world what I see," wrote one of the children.

"I also learned that I can tell a story with one picture.
