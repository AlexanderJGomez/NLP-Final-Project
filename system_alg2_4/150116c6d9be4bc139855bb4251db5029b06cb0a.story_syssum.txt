Washington (CNN) -- A bevy of political and diplomatic heavyweights came together Friday to remember Richard Holbrooke, the veteran U.S. diplomat who died last month after surgery to repair a tear in his aorta.
"The list of places he served and the things he did reads as a chronicle of American foreign policy" in recent decades, Obama noted.
"He was the consummate diplomat, able to stare down dictators and stand up for America's interests and values even under the most difficult circumstances," she said.
One of the world's most recognizable diplomats, Holbrooke's career spanned five decades, from the Vietnam War era to the war against the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, from the presidency of John F. Kennedy to that of Obama.
He also worked as a journalist and an investment banker.
After Obama took office in 2008, Holbrooke took one of the toughest diplomatic assignments -- U.S. special  representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, the region the president regards as critical to the fight against terrorism.
"We are determined to see it through," he said, and he made reference to the Vietnam War and the Dayton Accords in his comments.
There's no Slobodan Milosevic.
"There is no clear single address that you go to," he said.
