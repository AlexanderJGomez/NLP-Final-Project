(EW.com) -- Tom Cruise rang in the New Year smiling, as "Mission: Impossible -- Ghost Protocol" led the box office with an estimated $31.3 million over the three-day (Friday to Sunday) weekend.
In second place was "Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," which rose 9 percent for $22.1 million.
The original "Sherlock Holmes," by comparison, had earned $165.2 million by this point.
The same holds true for "Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked," which jumped an incredible 45 percent for $18.3 million.
In its first full weekend, Steven Spielberg's equine epic "War Horse" finished fourth with $16.9 million.
Whereas most films dropped from Friday to Saturday this weekend (on account of Saturday being New Year's Eve), "War Horse" actually jumped 20 percent on Saturday.
Finally, in fifth, was David Fincher's "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo," which rose 28 percent for $16.3 million.
