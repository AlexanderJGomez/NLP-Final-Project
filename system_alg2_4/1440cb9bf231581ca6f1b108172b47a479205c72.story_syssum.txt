Like, is Bieber getting some serious special treatment?
But isn't Bieber here legally?
While the Obama administration deported nearly 1.6 million people in the last four years, it's unclear how many were in the country legally.
According to a 1996 immigration law, it doesn't matter how long ago people committed their crime and the types of crimes eligible for deportation are vast and expanding.
He also has a pending assault charge and separate vandalism charges for egging his neighbor's house.
As with all deportations, the president has the "inherent power to choose which cases to act on," said Richard A. Boswell, immigration law professor at the University of California's Hastings College of the Law.
"A good immigration lawyer won't let that happen and I'm sure (Bieber) will be very well represented," Kolodziej said.
But, like Kolodziej said, his well-paid legal team probably won't let that happen.
But for many legal immigrants, they don't have the resources to hire top immigration and criminal attorneys to help navigate the system.
