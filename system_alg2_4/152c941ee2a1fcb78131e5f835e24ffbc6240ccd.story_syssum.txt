(CNN) -- Floating wind farms could soon be powering thousands of European homes after a prototype seaborne turbine sailed through technological trials off the coast of Agucadoura, Portugal.
Unlike existing offshore wind farms and underwater tidal turbines, floating structures do not have to be permanently fixed to the ocean floor.
This means WindFloat structures could theoretically be transported to any ocean location where there is a strong wind resource, says Weinstein.
Weinstein highlights lower construction costs -- the WindPlus turbine cost â‚¬20 million ($24.9 million) to build and install -- as a major advantage the technology has over existing offshore wind farms.
The initial structure off the coast of Portugal is merely a pilot installation to prove the device works and is viable, says Weinstein.
