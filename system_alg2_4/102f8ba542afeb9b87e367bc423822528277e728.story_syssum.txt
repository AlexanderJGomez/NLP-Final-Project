Not again.
At the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, on Thursday, South Korea's Yuna Kim, a 2010 Olympic gold medalist, skated an ethereally beautiful and outwardly perfect long program in the ladies free skating competition.
On paper, Sotnikova had one more triple jump than Kim, including the triple loop, which Kim does not do.
Figure skating is, after all, a sport.
There is a long history of controversy and scandal that continues to hang over the International Skating Federation, particularly as Russia's first individual female gold medalist (and on home ice, no less) brings familiar echoes of the Cold War.
Further, the sport had changed its scoring system to avoid this very situation.
Although she skated cleanly, Kerrigan had doubled a triple jump; Baiul, considered the superior artist, did a two-footed landing, and performed no triple-triple combination.
And this after rumors had dogged the ice dancing competition, with accusations that the Russians and the Americans (maybe the Cold War is over!)
If the governing body wants us to talk about figure skating as a sport, it needs to ensure that it behaves like one, with credibility and transparency.
