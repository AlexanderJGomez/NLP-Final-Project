John Bieniewicz, 44, died at Detroit Receiving Hospital from injuries suffered in what police said was an unprovoked attack.
"John Bieniewicz was a man who lived life to the fullest," friends wrote on a website dedicated to his memory.
The Wayne County Medical Examiner's office will determine the cause of death, according to Livonia police.
A hearing was set for July 10.
The site said Bieniewicz was a licensed soccer referee at all levels, professional, collegiate, high school and children's leagues, was president of the Metro Detroit Soccer Officials Organization, and sometimes refereed three games on a Saturday.
Last year, a 17-year-old soccer player in Utah pleaded guilty to homicide by assault in the death of referee Ricardo Portillo.
