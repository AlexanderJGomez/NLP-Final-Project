Humanitarian organizations reported Saturday they were expecting about 4,000 people in Tai, said Remi Dourlot, a spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
Besides the U.N. peacekeepers, humanitarian groups reported eight civilians died in violence, said Dourlot.
U.N. Operation in Cote d'Ivoire and Ivory Coast troops have increased their presence in the area, Dourlot said Saturday.
"This is an area where you have so many different types of armed people," she said.
The peacekeepers were on a reconnaissance patrol because U.N. officials had heard rumors several days earlier of armed men in the area threatening to attack a village, she said.
The latter was sworn in on May 21.
