Los Angeles Police Detective Orlando Martinez testified in the Jackson wrongful death trial that Murray was trying to deal with the large drop in value of his Las Vegas home, unpaid taxes and child support payments for eight children with seven women.
"Seeing the scene and talking to him about what he had done and how he did it raised questions."
His investigation revealed that Murray hadn't paid his mortgage in more than six months, his home was being foreclosed on and he had several liens for unpaid child support and tax debts, Martinez said.
The judge ordered that only one of Michael Jackson's brothers and sisters can come to court to watch the testimony at at a time -- and then only if Jackson family matriarch Katherine Jackson is present.
The defense lawyers asked that Randy Jackson, the only one attending the trial Tuesday with his 82-year-old mother, be booted from court.
Randy and Rebbie Jackson attended court Monday, the trial's opening day.
"No, no, this just happened," Murray told him, Senneff said.
"I don't even go there," Senneff said.
Panish even asked Senneff whether he had ever rescued a cat.
His ambulance was called to a west Los Angeles apartment to help an elderly Russian woman, Senneff said.
She suffered a minor head injury in her fall.
No court is scheduled for Friday.
