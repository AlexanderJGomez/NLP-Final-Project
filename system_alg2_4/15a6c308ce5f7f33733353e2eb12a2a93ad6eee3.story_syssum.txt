Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Myanmar's military rulers marked the country's independence day by commuting sentences and apparently releasing more than 30 prisoners, but opposition activists said Wednesday that the moves were unsatisfactory.
The southeast Asian country has been ruled by a military junta since 1962, and the generals have come under criticism for their human rights record in recent years.
"We have received information from Myanmar there are about 33 prisoners released yesterday," Aung Myo Thein, a spokesman for AAPP, said Wednesday.
But he said that the measures did not constitute a "real amnesty," since they just entailed the reduction of sentences, with most of those released not political prisoners.
The United States has tried to encourage an opening with Myanmar in recent years.
