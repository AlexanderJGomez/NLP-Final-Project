Haiyang Zhu, 26, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in connection with the death of Xin Yang, a graduate student studying accounting at Virginia Tech, officials said.
Haiyang purchased the knife used to kill Xin the morning of her death and attempted to call her 12 times, with the first call coming just after he bought the knife, Finch said.
In a writing titled "Will," Haiyang said he had expressed love for Xin and that she broke his heart when she said she was engaged to someone else, Finch said.
