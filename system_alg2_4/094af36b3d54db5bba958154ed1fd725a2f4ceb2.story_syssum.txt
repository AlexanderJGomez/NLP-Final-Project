Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- Tunisia's interim president and prime minister resigned from the ousted leader's ruling party, state TV said Tuesday, a move seen as a gesture to placate angry street demonstrators and keep the unity government afloat.
The displeasure was reflected Tuesday in central Tunis, when roving packs of protesters staged demonstrations and up to 1,000 protesters took to the streets of the capital and called the country's new unity government a sham.
The union's administrative committee, which met Tuesday in a Tunisian suburb, decided not to accept any government that has officials from the old regime and called for demonstrations against the ruling party.
He emphasized that a new election will take place in six months and will be the first to be held in a free Tunisia.
Ghannouchi -- who said the military didn't shoot people -- emphasized that he never gave any order for police to shoot people and only allowed tear gas and rubber bullets.
But many others remained angry about the country's new unity government, saying they don't want it to include anyone from the old administration, which fell apart after Ben Ali fled last week.
The new government will be tasked with leading Tunisia toward new elections, he said.
Among the holdovers from the previous government is Ahmed Friaa, the interior minister.
"There are still a couple of demonstrations because people are against the fact that older members of the political party (will remain) in power," she said.
Unlike the previous two days, no demonstrations had taken place in Sfax Tuesday, the report said.
He died early this month.
"The United Nations stands ready to provide assistance to the Tunisian people," he said.
