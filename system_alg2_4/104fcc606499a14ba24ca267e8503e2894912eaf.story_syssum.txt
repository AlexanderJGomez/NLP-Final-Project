That's because, in their conservative estimates, more than 2 million people get antibiotic-resistant infections each year, and at least 23,000 die because current drugs no longer stop their infections.
Antibiotics are designed to kill bacteria that cause infection.
They also took into account how many, if any, existing antibiotics still work on the bacteria.
Some CRE bacteria are resistant to all existing antibiotics.
Most patients who get this potentially deadly infection are on antibiotics for other infections.
The problem is that while antibiotics kill bad bugs, they also kill good bacteria in your gastrointestinal system that help fight off bad bacteria, C-Diff included.
To avoid what Frieden calls a "post-antibiotic" era, where none of the existing drugs work anymore and new ones haven't been approved, the CDC has created a four-step plan to stem the tide of antibiotic resistance.
You can also do your part, the CDC said, by preventing infections in the first place.
Patients need to demand fewer antibiotics and doctors have to resist patients requests for them when they know they won't work.
