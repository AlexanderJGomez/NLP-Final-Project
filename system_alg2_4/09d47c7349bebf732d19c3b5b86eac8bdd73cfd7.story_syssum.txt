Merrill Newman, who returned to the United States this weekend, told the Santa Cruz Sentinel in California that he was kept in a hotel room, not a jail cell, and fed traditional Korean food during his detention.
For weeks, the North Korean government offered no explanation as to why they were holding Newman.
"After I killed so many civilians and (North Korean) soldiers and destroyed strategic objects in the DPRK during the Korean War, I committed indelible offensive acts against the DPRK government and Korean people," Newman said, according to that report.
The official said the North Koreans had told the Obama administration in a telephone call that they were releasing Newman; no explanation was offered.
