And now the men will be going home with no medal at all after being crushed by Teemu Selanne's Finland 5-0 in the bronze medal game Saturday.
"The way we played the last two games we didn't deserve (a medal)," U.S. captain Zach Parise told NHL.com.

Hirscher leads the circuit in both the slalom and overall standings and almost made up a 1.28-second first-run deficit, finishing 0.28 seconds behind Matt.

"I was done snowboarding.
Elsewhere, was there any doubt about who would claim the team pursuit gold medals in speed skating?
Probably not.
