Agadir, Morocco (CNN) -- In Agadir, the arid heartland of Morocco's indigenous Berber population, a quiet oil boom is gaining momentum, one drop at a time.
But times have changed, and according to the Argan Oil Society, all the co-operatives are now staffed and run by local women.
Most of them were divorced or without a husband," said Zoubida Charrouf, a university professor who helped found one of the first cooperatives in the region.
Charrouf says that the new-found international popularity of argan oil -- which she describes as "liquid gold" -- has not only provided about 5,000 jobs for Berber women across 170 co-ops, but also an important social lifeline.
"The purpose of this work is to preserve the argan tree, because it was in decline," she said.
Charrouf says it's for all these reasons that 60,000 new trees are now planted each year.
They then place the kernels between two rocks, grinding them into a brown, peanut butter-like paste.
For now at least, the work is steady.
