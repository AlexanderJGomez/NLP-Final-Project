The lack of greenery has contributed to poor air quality and trapped heat, among a host of other environmental issues, claims architect Wassim Melki.
The 28-year-old architect claims there are 15,000 suitable rooftops -- around 80% of those in the city.
"Even planting just one on each would result in as many trees as there are in New York's Central Park," he said.
Comment: Would you give the scheme your support?
Melki estimates the total cost of the project at $3.5-4 million and is currently lobbying for the Wonder Forest via NGO ReAct and a Facebook page.
"Just imagine: The world's first rooftop garden city."
