Kerry will fly to Geneva on Friday "in an effort to help narrow differences in negotiations" with Iran, two senior State Department officials said.
The first step, if agreed upon, would require Iran to halt advances in its nuclear program in return for "very modest relief" from economic sanctions, he said.
Uranium enrichment is the key issue on the table during the talks with Iran over the future of its controversial nuclear program.
It would address an end game "that we all try to reach within a limited period of time, hopefully in less than a year" and a series of actions that both sides would take reciprocally "in order to build confidence and address the most immediate concerns," he said.
Zarif said the nuclear program would continue -- in some form.
The concerns of each side have been dealt with, he said.
Two senior U.S. administration officials said a deal on Iran's nuclear program is in the works.
-- not to activate a plutonium reactor at Arak.
The Iranian delegation was led by Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi.
The United States and its partners have accused Iran of diverting resources from its civilian nuclear program to try to develop a nuclear bomb.
In its August report, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, estimates that since declaring its nuclear program, Iran has processed 10 metric tons of uranium to 5% purity, the level used for nuclear power plants.
