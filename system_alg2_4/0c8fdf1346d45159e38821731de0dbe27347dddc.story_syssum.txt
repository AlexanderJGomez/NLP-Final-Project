On a frantic Friday at the Singapore Grand Prix, McLaren chief Martin Whitmarsh announced he wanted to bring Alonso back to the team he drove for during the 2007 season.
But any hopes McLaren had of luring Alonso back were quickly quashed, with the two-time world champion declaring he saw his long-term future with Ferrari.
"It is nice to have the comments from the other team principals every year saying they respect my job and my professionalism -- especially McLaren as there were so many rumors that we had a lot of problems that year.
Alonso's solitary season with McLaren was a turbulent one, with in-fighting damaging team unity as both the Spaniard and rookie driver Lewis Hamilton challenged for the world championship.
Alonso is desperate to win a world title with F1's most successful team, but has been thwarted by Red Bull's triple world champion Sebastian Vettel and a car which has at times been uncompetitive.
