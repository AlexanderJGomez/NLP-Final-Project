When the May 26 directive was issued, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said dispersant use should be cut by 75 percent.
Before May 26, BP used 25,689 gallons a day of the chemical dispersant Corexit.
The directive states that BP must ramp down dispersant use by "75 percent from the maximum daily amount used."
The highest recorded amount of dispersant used occurred on May 23, when 70,000 gallons were injected into the Gulf of Mexico.
The EPA and Coast Guard say they're trying to keep dispersant use to around 18,000 barrels a day.
"The EPA-Coast Guard directive has been successful in ensuring that BP uses the lowest volume of dispersant necessary," U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Erik Halvorson, a spokesman with the Unified Area Command.
"I think it is obvious we can never again allow for a repetition of what is happening right now, where the science experiment is being conducted without having any idea what the impact on marine life long term will be," said Markey.
