(CNN) -- Evidence in the case of a Michigan boy who vanished for nearly two weeks before turning up in his father's basement will not be turned over to prosecutors until at least next week, authorities said Wednesday.
That same day, the boy's father allegedly told investigators that he used a PVC pipe to discipline him, leaving a scar on the boy's chest, according to a petition filed with the Wayne County Department of Health & Human Services.
Michael Woody told CNN, adding the evidence could be turned over Wednesday.
The petition quoted the boy's grandmother as saying that he appeared thin and sickly when she last saw him.
The FBI declined comment beyond acknowledging that agents met with the child.
Charlie Bothuell IV learned his son was found during a taped interview last week with HLN's Nancy Grace, when he said he no idea the boy was in the basement.
A lie detector test taken by the father was inconclusive, police said.
Charlie is staying with relatives, police said.
