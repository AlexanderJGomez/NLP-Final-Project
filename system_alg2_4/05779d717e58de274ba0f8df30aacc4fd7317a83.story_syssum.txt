Merian C. Cooper's 1933 classic fantasy tale of a giant gorilla has become a musical reality at the Regent Theatre, in Melbourne, Australia -- thanks to a six-meter high robotic puppet, and the pioneering work of puppeteer Sonny Tilders.
The 46-year-old has more than two decades' experience making high-tech puppets and counts "Stars Wars -- Revenge of the Sith" and "The Chronicles of Narnia" among his many movie credits.
He was also the robotic brains behind the hugely successful "Walking with Dinosaurs -- The Arena Spectacular" stage show, but the scale of King Kong was unlike anything he had attempted before.
We were developing other technologies that we would need for animatronic limbs to move," he said.
"But to cut a long story short, we were so impressed by what the manned puppet could do that we had a change of heart and said we should do the whole show with marionette puppets.
Marrying the mechanical functions of interior with the organic-looking Lycra and latex exterior is one of the big challenges of animatronics, Tilders says.
Overlaying the air bags are a series of sculptured muscle bags made from a stretchy nylon material that expands and contracts to mimic the sinewy movements of the real thing.
"It's a machine that allows Kong to both move around the stage and be raised up and down but also take different positions," said Stage Technologies' Group CEO Mark Ager.
The company, which is currently helping pop star Pink fly around stage on her world tour, has previously assisted Tilders with the Walking with Dinosaurs project, helping create a flying prehistoric bird called an Ornithocheirus.
I think you have to see inferior robotic incarnations to see quite how clever (Kong) is."
It's only a matter of time before audiences worldwide get their chance to feel the towering stage presence of Kong, said Tilders.
"The financial model can't rely on 20 million people in Australia.
