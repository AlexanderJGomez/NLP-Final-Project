LONDON, England (CNN) -- British reality TV star Jade Goody married Sunday after being told by doctors last week that her cancer is terminal.
Shetty said last week that she was unable to attend the wedding due to filming commitments but was praying for Goody.
News of Goody's condition has sparked massive interest in the UK, both from the media -- which bid for rights to her story -- and among the public, who have contacted charities for information about cervical cancer.
But Clifford told ITN: "Ironically, a big part of what she's doing now is to fund her children's education.
Shetty, writing on her blog earlier this week, said that Goody had invited her to the wedding but had been unable to attend due to filming commitments in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
"I hope Jack makes a good father to them.
"It will be the dream finish to her dream day, and it makes so much difference.
Goody's bridesmaids were seen with the TV star Saturday, wearing plastic bald caps in a show of solidarity at the impact of her chemotherapy treatment.
