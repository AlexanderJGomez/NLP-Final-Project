(CNN) -- The year was 1890.
1890 is also the year Carmelo Flores Laura was born, or at least, that's what his family and the Bolivian government claim.
For starters, neither the birth certificate nor the national identity card is original.
Carmelo is not 123 years old despite the documents his family has shown.
Coles said the first red flag was the fact that Flores is a man.
The Gerontology Research Group has found a document that purportedly shows Flores is actually 107 years old, and not 123.
In any case, the fact that Carmelo Flores Laura has lived for more than a century in the arid highlands of Bolivia at an altitude of more than 12,000 feet is striking.
"I was born here in the highlands," Flores told CNN in Aymara, with his son translating into Spanish.
I was rather calm.
Flores' wife lived to be over 100 years old.
Coles said it's the genes.
They only have one detail in common: they have relatives who have lived a long time and children (who) also tend to live a long time," Coles said.
Cecilio is the only child of Flores still alive.
In fact, the government of Bolivia plans to honor Flores by declaring him "a living heritage" of the Bolivian people.
