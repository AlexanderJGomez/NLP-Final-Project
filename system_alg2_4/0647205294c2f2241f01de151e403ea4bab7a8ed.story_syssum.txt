Liverpool supporters at the Kop end paid their respects in an emotional afternoon at Anfield.
On Anfield's famous Kop, 96 candles were lit while commemorations took place at Hillsborough and also in Nottingham.
"Hillsborough affected so many lives, not just on Merseyside but across the whole of the UK," he said.
The Liverpool fans died in a crush which started just before the kick-off as the gate at the Leppings Lane End was opened with terrible consequences.
"It was wrong for people to blame, as some did, Liverpool fans on that day," he said.
"Let's never forget the fans who cruelly lost their lives on a day when we know the people of Liverpool were trying to help each other," he added.
Fittingly, the ceremony was concluded with Gerry Marsden leading the fans in singing Liverpool anthem 'You'll Never Walk Alone'.
