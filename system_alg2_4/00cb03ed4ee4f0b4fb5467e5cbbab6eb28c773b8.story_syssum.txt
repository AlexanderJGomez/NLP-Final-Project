"The agency has serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program," the report said.
But a senior U.S. official called the report "a big deal."
Ahmadinejad essentially called Yukiya Amano, the director general of the IAEA, a U.S. puppet and said the United Nations agency has no jurisdiction in Iran.
"Why don't you do a report on the U.S. nuclear program and its allies?
The IAEA said the some of the activities have both civilian and military applications, but others are specific to nuclear weapons.
Rep. Mike Rogers, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, raised the fear that Israel would attack Iranian nuclear facilities without further steps by the United States and its allies.
"If the Iranian regime acquires nuclear weapons capabilities, the U.S., Israel and our other allies in the region and around the world will face an unimaginable threat to our security.
The clock is ticking."
"Israel does not want a confrontation, but if it happens, the state of Israel will not be destroyed and there will not be 10,000 dead and not even 500 dead in any possible scenario," Barak said Tuesday on Israel Radio.
The United States also hopes international organizations, such as the United Nations, will take steps to further isolate Iran diplomatically.
U.S. officials said the Obama administration will use the report to lobby the international community to slap new economic sanctions against Iran.
