(CNN) -- Hurricane experts are throwing cold water on an idea backed by billionaire Microsoft founder Bill Gates aimed at controlling the weather.
Hurricanes are fueled by warm water, and cooling the waters surrounding a storm would slow a storm's momentum.
According to the patents, many tub-like barges would be placed directly in the path of an oncoming storm.
It's very difficult to bring up enough cold water in two to three days to have much effect."
The idea itself isn't groundbreaking, according to Gray, who said it could only be feasible if the barges were put into place at the beginning of hurricane season with the idea that storms will come.
And flooding and storm surges are determined by these outer winds, Gray said.
"You're doing something to the ocean that the hurricane would have done anyway," Emanuel said.
"This would only be practical if the amount [of money] you spend doing this would be less than the damage caused by the hurricane," Emanuel said.
A spokeswoman for Intellectual Ventures, which holds about 27,000 technology patents, didn't elaborate on the cost associated with the patent.
"This type of technology is not something humankind would use as a 'Plan A' or 'Plan B,'" Paul "Pablos" Holman, an inventor in the Intellectual Ventures laboratory, wrote on the company blog.
Hurricane expert Gray agrees.
