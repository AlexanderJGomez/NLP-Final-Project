Lawmakers new and old picked up their keys to their new offices and got sworn in for the 114th Congress on Tuesday.
Even Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cuz, two potential GOP presidential primary opponents, hugged it out in the hallways.
Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, a member of the new Democratic minority in the Senate and a former member of the House, said he was committed to getting something done on Capitol Hill even with Republicans at the helm — but sounded less than confident it was possible.
Florida Rep. Patrick Murphy, who was joined by his look-a-like older brother, planned like many of his colleagues to bring a young family member onto the floor — his younger nephew — while he was sworn in.
Former Michigan Sen. Carl Levin was meting out kisses of his own, planting one right on Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray's cheek after scooping her and his successor, new Sen. Gary Peters, into a group hug during Peters' introductory party.
Mia Love, an African-American Mormon representative from Utah, got a special visit from Rep. Paul Ryan — who thanked her friends and family for bringing "this budding star" to Congress — before heading to the House floor for the first business of the new Congress.
"I'm just going" with it, she added.
Indeed, it seemed despite Tuesday's fun, the dirty work of legislating wasn't far from lawmakers' minds.
