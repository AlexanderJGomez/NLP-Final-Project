Dan Glass, right, takes hold of the British PM's right arm just before he was about to receive his award.
"I've just superglued myself to your arm," Glass said he told Brown.
Glass is affiliated with the group Plane Stupid, which campaigns against airport expansion and climate change.
The prime minister managed to free himself in about 30 seconds, Glass said.
Police filed no charges.
The group -- which describes itself as non-partisan --is funded primarily by donations from individuals and organizations.
