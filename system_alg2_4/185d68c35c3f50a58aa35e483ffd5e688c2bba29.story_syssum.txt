While Lionel Messi was battling Thomas Muller to be the tournament's top goal scorer, while Tim Howard and Guillermo Ochoa were batting away shots on goal, while Roy Hodgson and Fabio Capello were stalking the sidelines, CNN was looking at the bigger picture.
We started with the FIFA world ranking for each team going into the World Cup, starting with Spain ranked number one, all the way down to Australia at 62.
The United States was the biggest country to qualify, followed by Brazil, Nigeria, Russia and Japan.
It was the second-largest country in the tournament, ranked third in the world by FIFA, and with manager Luiz Felipe Scolari's $3.8 million salary putting him fourth.
We picked it to come second, and it came first, for a rating of +1.
Yes, it was ranked fifth in the world going into the tournament, but it didn't shell out big money for a manager -- Alejandro Sabella was the 22nd-best paid coach -- and Argentina falls in the middle of the population table.
Ranked third in the CNN table, it actually came 23rd.
Ranked 10th in the world, with the second-best paid manager and and the 11th-largest population, we think it should have come fifth.
Russia actually came 24th, while Team USA came 15th.
Both teams did better than we predicted.
Belgium did even better, coming sixth, nine places higher than our calculations suggested.
