During his recent speech at West Point, President Obama rejected the lessons that these kinds of stories tell us about Afghanistan.
The second is that in Vietnam the U.S. faced a "broad-based popular insurgency" whereas today, according to most polls, a large number of Afghans support foreign assistance.
In trying to separate himself from the experience of Johnson, however, Obama did not give an accurate account of what many commentators have been saying recently, and he downplayed crucial aspects of the 1960s that do in fact offer warnings for today.
The point of the comparison is that it is impossible to ignore the fact that Obama faces similar challenges, as did Johnson when the "Americanization" of Vietnam began in the spring of 1965.
Both presidents also expanded the war just as they were trying to shape a broad domestic agenda.
In an era when American schoolchildren were being taught to duck and cover under their desks in case of nuclear war, this warning about Vietnam also made the war seem essential.
In Afghanistan, the U.S. is dealing with a war front that is notoriously treacherous, as the Soviets learned in the 1980s and the U.S. has learned since 2001.
The U.S. is also depending on a highly corrupt and undependable government in Afghanistan.
Obama should not be so defensive about the comparisons with Vietnam.
In 1965, Johnson made the mistake of excluding those who were trying to warn him about the dangers of the war.
