The British Film Institute is about to release the full 144-minute version of The Shining -- 24 minutes more than previously seen in Europe.
Kubrick adapted the film from the book written by horror novelist Stephen King -- and that's where my connection begins.
I visited Estes Park 34 years later and decided to take my family to the Stanley Hotel.
Our guide told us the hotel was inhabited by a number of ghosts, sometimes appearing in photographs as balls of energy.
There was one on the wood-panelled ceiling of the ballroom and later, when we checked back through all the pictures, we discovered that another had appeared on the photograph we took of the reception before meeting or tour guide.
"It was a film that shows nothing but ambiguity.
And this is what Stanley wanted," he said.
Which is good," said Harlan.
"It's a great compliment to Kubrick that people go into orbit about it."
And if there is anyone out there with a good theory (conspiratorial or otherwise) about those we'd love to hear from you.
