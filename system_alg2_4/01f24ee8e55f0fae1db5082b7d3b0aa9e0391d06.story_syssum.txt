(CNN) -- In brief remarks to the media just after returning to her hometown of Seattle, an emotional Amanda Knox thanked those who believed in her and supported her fight to overturn her murder conviction in Italy.
Being with her family, she said, is "the most important thing to me right now."
An Italian appeals court on Monday overturned Knox's murder conviction in the 2007 death of her roommate, British student Meredith Kercher.
Knox supporters in Seattle said they planned a rousing welcome.
CNN affiliate KOMO-TV reported that Wright was among a group of more than a dozen supporters who gathered at a hotel suite to watch the jury return its decision about Knox more than 5,000 miles away.
Asked what she'll say when she sees Knox, Ralph told KOMO, "I won't say anything.
Whitney said she "cried with joy" when Knox's conviction was overturned.
Welcome home!"
Welcome home!"
But later, another resident walked up to a CNN crew to say that she could not "care less about Knox returning home" and that she believed Knox committed the crime.
