(CNN) -- Karry Trout's first patient was a 38-year-old woman who had been diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer.
Patient navigation is a relatively new field in the health care industry.
"I know what the shock of a diagnosis is like.
By the time she was 18 months old, Ella had lost sight in both eyes.
"It's a lot," Trout says.
After a bit of research, Trout realized what had been missing from her experience with Ella.
In her role as a patient navigator, Trout does community outreach to raise awareness about the importance of breast cancer screening.
That's what I'm here for."
"Patient navigation, in part, is a function of how fragmented our (health care) system is," Pratt says.
Freeman then was a breast cancer surgeon in Harlem, New York, trying to figure out why patients in his hospital had a five-year survival rate of 39% when it should have been closer to 85%.
"People got lost in the complex system," Freeman says.
These barriers are never going to go away completely, Freeman says, but patient navigation can help address them.
If poor people don't have access to screening, diagnosis or treatment, you can create programs to concentrate on those one by one."
Even patient navigation, Freeman says, falls prey to our fragmented system -- one filled with specialists that each operate in a separate universe.
"I think when you go through things as a patient, you know, as a parent -- to be able to be treated with compassion and not just (as) another diagnosis is a gift," Trout says.
