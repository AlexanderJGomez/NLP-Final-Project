Apart from a Rooney free-kick that cracked the post midway through the second half, United rarely threatened or looked like a side capable of getting its league campaign off to a winning start.
"It is very disappointing that we have lost our first home match," Van Gaal told BT Sport in his post game interview.
A busy pre-season witnessed promising victories over Liverpool, Roma, Valencia and Real Madrid.
Judging by this performance, the prospective new arrivals can't arrive soon enough.
United began with a 3-5-2 system similar to that employed by Van Gaal's Dutch side at the World Cup earlier this summer before switching to a 4-4-1-1 as the game progressed.
"We have been working hard in pre-season on defensive shape and we can get even better at that but there were pleasing signs in the way we stuck together and the goals we scored against a side of Manchester United's resources," said Swansea manager Gary Monk.
With more solid, mature performances like this over the coming season such predictions will be made to look badly placed.
