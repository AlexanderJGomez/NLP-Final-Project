Jurors will decide his fate after hearing additional witness testimony in the penalty phase of the trial, which began Thursday evening and will continue Friday.
Before the verdict, witnesses showed jurors DNA evidence they said showed Jeffs conceived a baby with a 15-year-old child.
Court adjourned about two hours after jurors reached a verdict Thursday.

Jeffs stood silently for most of his 30-minute closing argument Thursday -- the latest dramatic twist in a trial that included frequent objections and sermonlike speeches about religious freedom.
Prosecutor Eric Nichols warned jurors not to be swayed by Jeffs' frequent invocations of religious freedom as a defense.
Jeffs began the hearing on Thursday -- the fifth day of his trial -- by asking for what he called constitutional protection because he represents a religious organization.
Prosecutors alleged that the recording documents Jeffs' sexual assault of a then-12-year-old girl in the presence of three other "wives."
Prosecutors said the 14-year-old was Jeffs' "spiritual wife" and conceived a child with Jeffs when she was 15.
Jeffs could be sentenced to five years to life in prison on the charge of aggravated sexual assault regarding the alleged 12-year-old.
The Texas legal proceedings began after about 400 children were taken from the sect's Yearning for Zion ranch in 2008.
The court also said the state lacked evidence to show that the children faced imminent danger of abuse.
Afterward, he was sentenced to two consecutive prison terms of five years to life.
Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff said last week Utah is prepared to retry Jeffs, depending on the outcome of the Texas case.
