(CNN) -- A black Agriculture Department employee who resigned after a video clip surfaced of her talking about a white farmer said Tuesday her remarks were taken out of context.
Sherrod resigned Monday after conservative media outlets aired the video, in which she says she did not give the white farmer "the full force of what I could do" to help him avoid foreclosure.
The poor-quality video shows Sherrod telling her audience that the farmer she was working with "took a long time ... trying to show me he was superior to me."
To prove she had done her job, she said, she took him to a white lawyer.
In the end, she said, the lawyer did not help the farmer and she "had to frantically find a lawyer who would file a Chapter 11 to stop the foreclosure."
Sherrod told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution there were white people, including a mayor, at the banquet where she spoke.
According to her remarks, she mistreated a white farmer in need of assistance because of his race," said Benjamin Todd Jealous, president and CEO of the civil rights group.
Sherrod said it was "unfortunate that the NAACP would make a statement without even checking to see what happened.
What would I do?"
But he said, given later remarks made by Sherrod in the clip, "it's clear that this is an anecdote ...
"I think she is using this an anecdote to work through her own issues but also to show the audience we can move beyond and transcend some of these circumstances," he said.
Tea Party Express leader Mark Williams posted on his blog a faux letter from NAACP president Benjamin Jealous to President Abraham Lincoln in which Williams ridicules the organization's use of "colored" in its historic name and uses multiple other stereotypes to bolster his point.
