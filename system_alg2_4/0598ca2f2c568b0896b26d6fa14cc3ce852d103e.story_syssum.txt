Los Angeles (CNN) -- Justin Bieber will not face a felony charge of robbery despite a woman's claim the singer tried to steal her cell phone last month.
The accuser told Los Angeles Police Department robbery/homicide detectives that the incident began after she used her iPhone to take a photo of Bieber at the batting cages in the Sherman Oaks Castle Park.
Bieber and the woman "tussled over it for a moment," she said.
The daughter later told investigators she was already crying from the excitement of being near Justin Bieber.
"Justin was just enjoying hanging out with friends at the batting cage and playing mini-golf," the source told CNN.
