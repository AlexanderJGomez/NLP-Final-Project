This is just one of many incidents that have occurred in Beijing over the weekend following last week's launch of a 100-day campaign to "clean out" non-Chinese living or working illegally in the city.
Until the end of August, all foreigners are expected to always have on them a valid passport, visa and resident permit, as stipulated by an announcement on Peaceful Beijing, the official Beijing Public Security Bureau account on popular Chinese micro-blogging site Sina Weibo.
"Beijing will stick to the policy of reform and opening up, and we sincerely welcome foreign friends to work and live in Beijing," a spokesman told the state-run Xinhua news agency, adding that foreigners' legitimate rights will be protected.Ã‚
Another longtime expat, David Park, was equally distressed.
These events will make his decision easier, he said.
Park was not the only person expressing a desire to leave in the wake of tensions.
Beijing police revealed the foreigner in the video to be a Briton on a tourist visa.
Police deny the incidents are related, but in the minds of both foreigners and Chinese they are.
When Beijing resident Mandy Zhang's mother caught wind of the video, she called her 26-year-old daughter and asked her not to visit places that foreigners frequent.
According to statistics provided by the city government, Beijing is home to about 120,000 foreigners.
Whatever the cause, as China's economy continues to grow, its foreign population will likely rise too.
