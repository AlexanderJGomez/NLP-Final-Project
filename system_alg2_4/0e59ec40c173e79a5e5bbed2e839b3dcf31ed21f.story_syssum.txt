The busiest shopping day of the year also saw a major boom for gun sales, with the federal background check system setting a record of more than 175,000 background checks Friday, according to the FBI.
On average, more than 500 gun background checks a day fail because of incomplete information required for a decision, according to the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which is responsible for checks on firearm purchases from federally licensed shops.
The agency brings in 100 extra employees to deal with the increase.
Last year, the agency completed 21 million background checks, and about 1.1% of those purchases were denied, the agency said.
The gun shop can read the information to the background check agency  over the phone or run the information through a secure Internet connection.
Fischer said major retailers such as Walmart, Dick's Sporting Goods, Cabela's and Gander Mountain usually won't go through with the sale without complete information.
