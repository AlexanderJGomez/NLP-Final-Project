Jos√© Miguel Vivanco says conviction of Peru's ex-president is a warning to those who deny human rights.
It is one of the first times a nation's own independent courts have convicted a former leader for such serious human rights crimes and it sets an important precedent for a region that suffered so much from political violence and rights violations.
Just a few years ago, Fujimori had near-total control of Peru's judiciary.
Just 20 years ago, it was exceedingly rare for even the most brutal leaders to be brought to book.
In country after country, particularly in Latin America, victims were inspired to challenge the amnesty laws of the 1980s and 1990s that had allowed the perpetrators of atrocities to go unpunished and, often, to remain in power.
After the creation of UN tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the world established the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and serious war crimes when national courts are unable or unwilling to do so.
A second panel of the Supreme Court will now review an appeal by Fujimori.
It is likely, however, that yesterday's verdict will help give momentum to efforts currently underway in many Latin American countries to bring other human rights violators to justice.
