(CNN) -- For years, Republican presidents and presidential candidates have strip-mined Clint Eastwood movies for rhetorical nuggets.
The beloved actor/director, 82, was the "mystery guest" at the Republican Convention, a warm-up act for Sen. Mario Rubio of Florida, who introduced candidate Romney.
But to many, the political nuggets Eastwood delivered this time were more like fool's gold.
For this film critic and longtime admirer of Eastwood (and a registered Democrat), it was not the best hour for the former mayor of Carmel, California.
Not at all.
Why not?"
First of all, Eastwood publicly endorsed Romney this month.
As critic Dave Kehr has noted, "Ambivalence runs deep in his movies, just as it runs through American culture."
During the Nixon years liberals branded Eastwood movies like "Dirty Harry" as "fascist."
Is that Republican?
Is that Democrat?
