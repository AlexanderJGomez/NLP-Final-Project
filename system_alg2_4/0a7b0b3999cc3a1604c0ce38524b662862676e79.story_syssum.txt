St Petersburg, Russia (CNN) -- Most artistic directors' first day leading a new ballet company is all about meeting the dancers.
He's the first foreigner to lead a Russian ballet company in over a century and has been charged with bringing modern choreography to the Mikhailovsky's classical repertoire.
That goes without saying, but the attitude that exists towards Russian ballet in the West is more passionate," said Vladimir Kekhman, billionaire fruit importer and General Director of the Mikhailovsky Theatre.
"I looked within our industry to see who were considered living legends of choreography, and when I looked within Russia, I realized that we didn't have choreographers who had the ability to not just choreograph, but also head the company," he said.
At first Duato was reluctant to change direction towards classical ballet.
Why not?
It really is a pleasure to be in a place where ballet (has been) part of the cultural tradition for (such a) long time, and at the same time they want to break through and do new things," Duato said.
Duato has set himself a challenging schedule, hand-picking three dancers to create a ballet so new it doesn't even have a name yet.
"In this repertoire, I can show a different side of myself, express myself differently and find something new in me," she said.
"Together we are going to work into something," said Duato.
