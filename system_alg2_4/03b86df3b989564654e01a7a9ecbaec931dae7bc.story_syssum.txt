His vasectomy missions to Third World countries inspired me to launch both a movement and to become his 25,000th client.
To transform this positive choice into a global movement, Stein and I created the first World Vasectomy Day in 2013 -- and set out to inspire 100 doctors in 25 countries to do 1,000 vasectomies.
But if ease and effectiveness don't convince a man of the benefits of vasectomy, there are many compelling sociological and health reasons as well.
Sadly, while men waffle on the sidelines, more than 300 million women have had tubal ligations -- six times the number of men having vasectomies, even though tubal ligations are more invasive, costly and risky.
With all these reasons, you'd think for men who no longer wish to have children choosing a family planning option that is permanent, safe and secure would be a no-brainer.
There were men who traveled hundreds of miles to have the procedure for their wives, and those who did it to help their children emerge from poverty.
In my travels, I met men in their 20s who know they don't want children and men in their 70s who do.
On World Vasectomy Day, we don't decide who should or should not get a vasectomy, but we do insist that it be voluntary.
The unfair part is that it's women who take it on almost exclusively for one third of their lives.
What we learned in creating World Vasectomy Day bodes well for our future.
