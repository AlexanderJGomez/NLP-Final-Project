(CNN) -- Facebook, where people love to discuss politics and complain about other people discussing politics, saw a huge surge in Election Day chatter on Tuesday.
Over the course of the day, there were more than 71.7 million election related posts and comments on Facebook in the United States and 88.7 million around the world.
Obama was mentioned 10 million times on Facebook during Election Day.
Quitting Facebook isn't the only way to cut out the politics.
