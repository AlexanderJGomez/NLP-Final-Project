Sarah Palin has called plans to build a community center and mosque near the site of the 9/11 terror attack in New York City an "unnecessary provocation."
He said the project "is not a mosque."
New York's Landmarks Preservation Commission is scheduled to vote in August on whether an 1850s structure on the site of the proposed center should be granted landmark status.
The heckling and intense nature of the hearing got to be too much for some participants.
Some Muslim community leaders say the project could provide an opportunity for improving interfaith relations.
