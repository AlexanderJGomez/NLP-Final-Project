Unfortunately my mother would say: "Come on let's go to the fabric store," and she would make all of these beautiful clothes for myself and the other ladies of Destiny's Child, and after so many years my fans said we want to buy these clothes somewhere, so it was a natural thing for us to do this line, and it's so great for us to be able to do it together, number one because we get to spend time together, and two because we have such respect for each others' taste.
Tina: And it's funny when you need the clothes they won't loan them to you, and when you don't need them everyone wants to give them to you, so that's how it started but that was very exciting to see the clothes on TV.
Becky: How do you get on with each other?
Beyonce: This collection was inspired by a lot of my travels.
Tina: I think the holiday collection -- what Beyonce is wearing now.
I'm over the moon.
Beyonce: I don't.
My mother has always told me that beauty comes from within and what's exciting about being a woman is you can say today I feel like being, today I feel really conservative, today I'm feeling classy, today I am going on a date and I want to just be a showstopper and you know there is this variety of beautiful clothes that can bring out whatever you feel inside but it comes from here and you should wear your clothes they shouldn't wear you.
