North Korea has arrested a U.S. citizen for committing an unspecified crime against the country, state media reported Friday, 10 days after U.S. officials said an American had been detained by the reclusive nation.
A U.S. official told CNN last week that an American citizen named Kenneth Bae had been detained in North Korea for more than a month.
Bae and the group were on a five-day trip to the country, according to South Korea's Yonhap News.
The Embassy of Sweden acts as our protecting power for issues involving U.S. citizens in North Korea," Nuland said then.
