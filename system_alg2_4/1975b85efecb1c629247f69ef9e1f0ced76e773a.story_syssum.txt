Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- More than 30 people have been shot dead in Nigeria, the head of Amnesty International said Friday, only a day after the rights group accused Nigerian security forces of committing serious abuses in their efforts to crack down on the militant Islamist group Boko Haram in the region.
"We cannot improve human rights by taking people's lives and for security forces to be themselves beyond the pale of the law is just simply unacceptable."
Lt. Col. Sagir Musa, a spokesman for the Joint Task Force, told CNN that the reported killings are under investigation.
In its report Thursday, Amnesty International condemned the increasingly brutal attacks carried out by Boko Haram since 2009, but said Nigeria's security forces "have perpetrated serious human rights violations" in their response.
A spokesman for the Nigerian military, Col. Mohammed Yerima, rejected the allegations made in Thursday's report.
He also dismissed allegations made in the report that the military participated in extrajudicial killings of suspects or used torture during interrogations.
If they are found not to be members of Boko Haram, we release them immediately, take them back to where we picked them up and we apologize," he said.
There have been fewer attacks by Christian militant groups.
