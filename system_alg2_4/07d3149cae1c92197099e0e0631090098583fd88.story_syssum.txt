AUSTIN, Texas (CNN) -- Lady Bird Johnson, who was first lady during the 1960s and in her later years became an advocate for beautifying public landscapes, died Wednesday, family spokesman Tom Johnson said.
After suffering a stroke in 2002 that limited her ability to speak, she communicated chiefly by writing.
"Lady Bird Johnson embodied all that is beautiful and good about the great state of Texas," Perry said.
She hoped to become a newspaper reporter, but those plans changed after she met a 26-year-old congressional aide named Lyndon Baines Johnson.
Early on, Lady Bird Johnson proved herself to be the quintessential political wife.
She turned it around and later used the station as a base for a multimillion-dollar communications company based in Austin.
Lady Bird Johnson traveled more than 35,000 miles during that campaign.
As the Johnsons moved into the White House, Lady Bird Johnson "went around and went to all of the staff that was remaining in their jobs, told them how happy she was to have them there," said Leticia Baldridge, Jacqueline Kennedy's former social secretary.
Of the eight Southern states that many had expected to vote for Republican Barry Goldwater, six went for LBJ -- in part, it was said, because of the first lady's efforts.
Lyndon Johnson died in 1973.
The center was renamed the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center in 1998.
