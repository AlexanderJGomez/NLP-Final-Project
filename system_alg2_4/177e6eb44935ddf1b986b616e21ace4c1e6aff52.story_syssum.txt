Fort Meade, Maryland (CNN) -- Bradley Manning, the Army private whose disclosure of hundreds of thousands of U.S. military and diplomatic documents gave American officials a global case of heartburn, was sentenced to more than three decades in prison Wednesday.
The attorney, David Coombs, said the statement was part of Manning's application for a pardon from President Barack Obama.

Manning will be eligible for parole in 10 years, Coombs said.
Prosecutors have said Manning acted as a "determined insider" in leaking classified information about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, arguing his actions created grave risk, disrupted diplomatic missions and endangered lives.
"Mr. Manning's treatment has been intended to send a signal to people of conscience in the U.S. government who might seek to bring wrongdoing to light," Assange, now holed up in the Ecuador's embassy in London, said in a written statement.
But the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Buck McKeon, criticized what he called a light sentence compared to the life terms some convicted spies have received.
"Given the vast damage he did to our national security and the need to send a strong signal to others who may be tempted to disclose classified information, this is a dangerous conclusion," McKeon added.
"There may not be a soldier in the history of the Army who displayed such an extreme disregard" for his mission, Morrow said Monday during final sentencing arguments.
But Coombs said Manning was "a young man capable of being redeemed" and urged Lind to hand down "a sentence that allows him to have a life."
