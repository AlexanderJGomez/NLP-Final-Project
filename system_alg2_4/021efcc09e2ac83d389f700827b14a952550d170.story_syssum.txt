Zachary Quinto, who plays Spock in the re-booted feature film incarnation of "Trek," is excellent in the role.
Spock is Nimoy.
He even wrote a book with the title, "I Am Not Spock" (1977) that was bought by millions of readers who didn't buy the title for a nanosecond.
A couple of books of poetry are also credited to him as were a collection of photographs celebrating what he termed "the feminine aspect of God."
Nimoy did.
I got to meet him when the latter film opened.
He was Nimoy and he was Spock.
Still, it was always nice to know Nimoy could smile, even if Spock couldn't.
