Khin Zaw Lin lives in a Thai garbage dump with only his adopted mother and his toy gun to  protect him.
I find Lin walking in a festering landscape of rotting food, plastic bags and junk at the Mae Sot garbage dump in Thailand near the Thai-Myanmar border.
Many are children.
He shows me his feet, which were filthy and ribbed with cuts.
My assistant told me about Lin's home while he was researching another story on the border area in Myanmar, the country once known as Burma.
We'd been told there are orphans living at the dump, but people are wary.
Lin gives the money to his adopted mother.
Life under the military junta in Myanmar can be brutal.
She found a garbage dump instead.
The United Nations established refugee camps in Thailand for those who flee Myanmar, but the camps are reserved only for victims of political persecution.
As a result, these refugees are trapped in the garbage dump -- not enough money to go elsewhere and no prospects back home.
Near the end of my meeting with Lin, I ask his adopted mother if she, and Lin, would ever escape the rubbish dump.
