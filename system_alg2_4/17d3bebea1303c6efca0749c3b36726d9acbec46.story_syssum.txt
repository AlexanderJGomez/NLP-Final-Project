(CNN) -- HBO has just launched a new TV series based on a novel by Tom Perrotta called "The Leftovers," which in turn is based on the fundamentalist Christian idea of the rapture.
Chaos strikes in the fictional Mapleton, New York -- and throughout the world.
The famous "Left Behind" series by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins was already out there.
Then Jesus will come yet again, for a final judging.
The rapture concept is relatively new.
This may come as a shocker to many, but it's a fact: Before John Nelson Darby imagined this scenario in the clouds, no Christian had ever heard of the rapture.
The dead in Christ will rise first; then we, who are left alive, will be snatched up with them on clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so we shall always be with the Lord."
First, it's important to note that Jesus himself never talked about the rapture, ever.
In Thessalonians, Paul is writing like the poet he is, creating a spectacular vision of a returning lord who will be given a great reception in the air.
The crucial word in the relevant verse is "meet": Those who are left alive will be caught up on clouds to meet the Lord in the air.
And why not?
At least he won't have to watch "The Leftovers" on TV.
