Ayotzinapa, Mexico (CNN) -- Students, parents, friends and residents of this town in southern Mexico are demanding justice in the case of a slain student they say was the victim of horrific torture.
Mondragon was a student at a rural teachers college in Ayotzinapa, Guerrero state.
Fellow students say that on the night of September 26, a group of about 100 of them, including Mondragon, decided to go to Iguala, about two hours away, to stage a protest in Iguala.
The Iguala incident in has sparked protests all across Mexico, some of them violent.
They have also blocked access to shopping malls in the beach resort of Acapulco.
Mexican officials say the couple, along with the town's director of public safety, are the "probable masterminds" of the attack against the students.
Neri de la Cruz, an 18-year-old student at the teachers college, says Mondragon was one of his best friends.
De la Cruz was one the students on their way to the protest.
CNN is not identifying her.
He had also just become a father.
"My baby will now grow up without her father," Mondragon's widow says.
