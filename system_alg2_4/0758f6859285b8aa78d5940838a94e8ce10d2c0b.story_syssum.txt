(CNN) -- A month before Delvin Barnes grabbed a woman off a street in Philadelphia, he hit a teen with a shovel in Virginia and stuffed her into the trunk of a car, authorities say.
Like in Philadelphia, the abduction in Virginia was brazen.
Though police did not release many details of the Virginia incident, authorities say the victims didn't know the suspect.
The victim told police she was hit in the head with a shovel and stuffed into the trunk of a car, according to Capt.
She was taken to the home of the suspect's parents in Charles City County, where she was sexually abused, authorities said.
Two miles away, she stumbled onto a business, and employees brought her inside.
The mother says Barnes allegedly told her daughter that he was going to kill her.
A man then got out and met Freeland-Gaither at an intersection, Philadelphia police Chief Inspector Dennis Wilson said.
During the struggle, her glasses and cell phone fell to the road.
(It) really was horrific to watch it unfold," Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said.
He's pure evil.
A day after the kidnapping, the suspect allegedly used her ATM card at a machine in Aberdeen, Maryland.
Barnes was told the device was in the car, Schwartz said.
As for Barnes, he now sits at the Riverside Regional Jail in Prince George, Virginia, just over the James River from Charles City County.
