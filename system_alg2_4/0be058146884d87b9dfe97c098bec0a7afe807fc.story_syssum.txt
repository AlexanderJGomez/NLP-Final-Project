Negotiations between Bay Area Rapid Transit and union leaders stretched until nearly 3 a.m. Wednesday, CNN affiliate KGO reported.
The Bay Area Council Economic Institute says its "conservative estimate" finds that lost worker productivity alone is costing the region at least $73 million a day.
BART planned limited charter bus service for those working on Independence Day in case no deal is reached Wednesday.
Unions asked for a 21% pay increase.
"We are sorry that the actions of ATU and SEIU have caused such a tremendous disruption to the people of the Bay Area," BART said in a statement Tuesday announcing "no indication" that employees would return to work Wednesday.
BART is the nation's fifth-largest all-rail train system in the United States, with 44 stations in 26 cities that make up the Bay Area, according to the transit authority.
