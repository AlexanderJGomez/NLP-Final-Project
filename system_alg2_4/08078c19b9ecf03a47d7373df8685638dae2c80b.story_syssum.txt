Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- We had not been in Port-au-Prince in a month, not since those horrible days following the earthquake when the city looked like wreckage.
But those optimistic signs were eclipsed Sunday night when a torrent of rain poured down on this wounded city where outdoor tent communities have sprouted up in every empty space.
"When is it going to end?"
The big quake on January 12 had rattled a cinder block wall in her play yard, crushing her leg, which now has a cherry red cast.
Women ran up to the staff asking for food, new tarps and clean water for their children.
That day, women from the ravine had come escorting children who'd been washed with soap and rain water.
Chicks picked at droppings.
No one had eaten fresh food in a week, and the Maison staff brought baby formula and rice.
A missionary worried aloud about a newborn wrapped in plastic whose parents had no formula for the baby's first five days.
No immediate reports of damage were made, but the aftershock sent frightened people once again out into the bug-filled night.
People sleeping outside now feel threatened by the rains, but sleeping inside carries the threat of the seemingly never-ending aftershocks.
In the food line, the crowd was so quiet for people who looked hungry and faced a long wait.
