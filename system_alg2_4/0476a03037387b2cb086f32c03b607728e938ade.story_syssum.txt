Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has denied allegations that she failed to heed warnings of possible corruption in a rice subsidy program whose recent problems have stoked anger among farmers in the country's rural heartland.
Yingluck insists that the rice subsidy program, introduced in 2011, has been successful and benefited farmers.
But critics says it has wasted large amounts of public funds trying to please rural voters, hurting exports and leaving the government with large stockpiles of rice it can't sell without losing money.
Groups of farmers have held protests in recent weeks after not being paid for their rice.
The farmers said their planned protest wasn't political -- unlike the anti-government demonstrators in central Bangkok, they say they don't want to see the ouster of Yingluck.
Earlier this week, police tried to clear demonstrators out some protest sites.
The protest leaders say they want to rid the country of Yingluck and her wealthy brother, the deposed former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.
The protesters say they want Yingluck's government replaced by an unelected "people's council," which would oversee electoral and political changes.
