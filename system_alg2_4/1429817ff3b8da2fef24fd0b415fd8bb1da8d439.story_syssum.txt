It uses a system designed by Amazon subsidiary Kiva that keeps track of all inventory so the robots know exactly what is on each storage unit.
"The robots job is really to move inventory from storage to the work station," said Brian Lemerise VP of third-party fulfillment at Quiet Logistics.
This is made possible by the bar codes they drive over and the cameras on the bottom of the drive units, which together communicate where the bot is driving to.
"The software will allocate a certain number of spots to a specific robot; that's what keeps the robots from hitting each other"
Quiet Logistics has 400 people working on fulfillment at the Massachusetts facility alone, so these smart machines are not yet ready to replace living workers.
