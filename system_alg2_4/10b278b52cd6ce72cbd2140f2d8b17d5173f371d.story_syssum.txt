Ashley and Tyson Gardner tried unsuccessfully for years to get pregnant.
Ashley Gardner: We tried EVERYTHING under the sun.
It worked really really really REALLY well!
It was getting hard getting asked ALL THE TIME why I didn't have children yet.
I found that so many others were going through the same thing!
We just announced on our private pages to our friends and family and the picture was so priceless that everyone started sharing it and we started getting hundreds of friend requests from people we didn't know.
I had never been so excited and terrified in the same instant.
My husband is the oldest of 10 children so he is ready to take on anything!
He is the favorite uncle to all our nieces and nephews.
After eight long, heartbreaking years of infertility and every month passing by with a negative pregnancy test you do get discouraged!
They put both back to give me the best odds of one sticking so we would at least get one baby out of this since I didn't have any eggs to freeze and this was probably our last shot at this.
Gardner: Only thing I can think of is what I stated above.
