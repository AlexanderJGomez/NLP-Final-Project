A weekend midair collision over northern Wisconsin sent one small plane careening into the ground while another limped safely back to the runway.
Robinson said the lead plane, which crashed, had four skydivers aboard along with its pilot; the trailing plane had five parachutists.
The pilot got out safely, used his emergency parachute and landed," Robinson said.
The pilot of the trailing plane landed safely and picked up the pilot of the crashed aircraft along the runway as he taxied in, Johnson said.
