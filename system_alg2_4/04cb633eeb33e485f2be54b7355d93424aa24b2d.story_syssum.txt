(CNN) -- A man who crashed his plane in the Florida Panhandle in an apparent attempt to fake his death was sentenced Wednesday to more than four years in federal prison, officials said.
Authorities believe that Schrenker hatched the plot for the January crash after investigators with the Indiana secretary of state's office searched his home and business on December 31.
"The defendant stated to air traffic controllers that he was not going to make it," according to documents filed in court providing a factual basis for Schrenker's guilty plea.
After Schrenker made that statement, his aircraft leveled off, and he remained at 3,500 feet while he made course corrections taking him closer to Harpersville, Alabama, where he had stored a motorcycle in a storage facility, the documents said.
The jets followed the plane until it crashed near the Blackwater River in East Milton, Florida, according to court documents.
In a search of the plane, authorities found handwritten notes on the inside back cover of a campground book, saying among other things, "windshield is spider cracking," "doors open," "bleeding very bad" and "graying out," the documents said.
When found, authorities said at the time, Schrenker was bleeding from cuts on his wrists after an apparent suicide attempt.
Indiana officials agreed to allow the federal case against Schrenker to proceed before seeking to extradite him, prosecutors have said.
