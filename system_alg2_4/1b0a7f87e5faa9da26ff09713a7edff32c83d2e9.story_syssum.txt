Between June and August this year, China plans to launch its manned Shenzhou-9 spacecraft and then rendezvous and dock with a space lab which has been orbiting the earth since September.
If all goes as planned, China will become only the third nation, next to the U.S. and Russia, to dock capsules in space.
"China also plans to establish its own space lab around 2016 and assemble a 60-ton manned space station around 2020, when the current International Space Station is estimated to likely retire."
China's space program has become a campaign issue in the United States.
"Every serious analyst understands that the Chinese are going all out to dominate space," Gingrich said.
Chinese officials speak of a three-step manned space flight plan: send man into orbit, dock spacecraft together to form a small space lab, and ultimately build a large space station.
Still, China did not put a man in space until 2003, 41 years after John Glenn became the first American to orbit earth.
Several months later, he was promoted to general.
Only Russia, the United States and China have sent men into space.
Two years earlier, a rocket exploded in this launch site after liftoff and killed several people on the ground.
This time, when the Chinese-made rocket rumbled skyward, the crowd in the hall cheered.
Experts say the upcoming launch will place China close to putting a space station in orbit.
China promises to never use space research for military purposes.
Still, experts say, the U.S. remains concerned about Chinese space activities.
That will position China just next to the U.S. as a dominant space power.
