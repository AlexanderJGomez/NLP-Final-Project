Big-spending City ended a record run of seven successive draws to hand the Londoners a third league defeat this season and allow rivals Manchester United to gain ground.
Carlo Ancelotti's team made the perfect start when City striker Emmanuel Adebayor inadvertently put the ball in his own net in the eighth minute after goalkeeper Shay Given's save from a Nicolas Anelka shot hit him in the back and rebounded in.
Manchester United, on the other hand, had no such worries as they continued the form that saw them brush aside Tottenham in the quarterfinals of the League Cup on Tuesday.
The defeat left Gianfranco Zola's struggling West Ham side just a point above the relegation zone.
Arsene Wenger's team bounced back from successive 3-0 defeats by Chelsea and Manchester City, the latter in the League Cup quarterfinals in midweek, to win 2-0 at home to mid-table Stoke.
Substitute striker John Carew added a third from the penalty spot two minutes from time after Duke was booked for bringing down Ashley Young as Villa followed up the midweek win over Portsmouth that put Martin O'Neill's side in the semifinals of the League Cup.
Avram Grant celebrated his first victory as manager of bottom club Portsmouth with a 2-0 victory at home to Burnley, as striker Aruna Dindane made up for a first-half penalty miss by adding the second goal following defender Hermann Hreidarsson's 65th-minute opener.
