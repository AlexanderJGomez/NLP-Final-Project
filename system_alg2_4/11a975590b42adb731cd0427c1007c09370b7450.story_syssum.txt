(CNN) -- Next Monday, Google is officially shutting down its popular RSS feed reader, Google Reader.
(Many of the tools we mention will import data automatically from Google if you sign up before Reader closes.)
Some new tools were rushed on to beat the July 1 demise of Google Reader and are bound to undergo more changes and improvements -- some are still being created such as Betaworks' Digg Reader.
Is sharing stories important, or is reading the news a solitary activity?
Major news surfaces naturally on the social network; a chorus of links or commentary about important stories will likely make its way into anyone's feed, whether they're following news junkies or just friends.
You can follow your favorite news organizations or drill down by finding their Twitter accounts for specific sections or topics.
The RSS fire hose of news can be overwhelming for many people.
The tools are big on sharing and use images heavily for a more magazine-like reading experience.
RSS readers are great because you can scan headlines and the first few sentences of articles and get the gist without having to read them, only going further if it's a topic about which you want to know more.
Apple's Safari browser also offers a Read Later button.
There is also Google News, which looks at all the news sources and arranges the breaking stories by popularity, highlighting the in-depth, opinion and featured stories on the topic.
News.me sucks in your Twitter and Facebook feeds and turns them into digestible daily e-mails that summarize the most talked about stories of the day.
Google Reader was a great tool that will be missed, but its death is an opportunity to try new things and play with different apps, sites and tools for reading news online.
