(CNN) -- Clashes broke out Saturday as far-right groups from across Europe gathered in Denmark for a rally they said was meant to make their governments act against the threat of Islamic extremism.
Police arrested 25 people following the violence, said Husted, most of them from extreme left-wing groups.
"Our governments and our media behave as if Islamic extremism exists only in the head of a few extremists, and claim that it is unfair to make the connection between Islam and extremism," an online EDL statement said.
In its statement, the EDL said it does not believe that "the way to combat extremism is with more extremism."
The British government has previously banned some marches by the EDL, whose members are widely seen as holding extremist views.
