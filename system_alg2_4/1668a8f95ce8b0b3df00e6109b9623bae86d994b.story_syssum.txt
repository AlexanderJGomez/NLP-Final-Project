But adversity has made him wise beyond his years, and Malek knows better.
"I need support, I need help because I'm representing Afghanistan -- especially disabled people," says Malek, who more than anything, wants to swim for his country at the 2012 Paralympic Games in London.
He is very strong, and I am sure that he can take part in any competition.
"I don't have any coach or any trainer to teach me how to swim, how to prepare for the games, so I'm doing by myself, because I love swimming," says Malek.
"I know that we don't have enough resources for sportsman in Afghanistan," says Nikpai, "but the younger generations in this country love sports, so they are making efforts to try and go out of the country for competitions.
"They want to bring medals back home.
Nikpai is very happy to see Malek make progress.
Friends and family also find hope in him -- something they say is missing in a country torn apart by far too many years of war.
He realizes the odds aren't exactly in his favor, but is sure things are bound to get better.
