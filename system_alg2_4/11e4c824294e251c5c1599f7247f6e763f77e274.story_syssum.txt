On a day in which the girlfriend of victim Odin Lloyd took the stand and Lloyd's mother again left the courtroom in tears, Bristol County Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh on Friday had a warning for the jury.
Hernandez will not be watching his former team.
Hernandez, 25, pleaded not guilty in the 2013 killing of Lloyd, 27, who dated the sister of Hernandez's fianc√©e.
Later Friday, Shaneah Jenkins, 23, who was dating Lloyd at the time of his death, took the witness stand.
In opening statements Thursday, defense lawyer Michael Fee said the two men were close friends and that Hernandez had no reason to kill Lloyd.
"Aaron Hernandez is not the murderer of his friend," Fee said.
Other witnesses Friday described how Lloyd's body was found near Hernandez's house.
A marijuana blunt found near Lloyd's body had traces of both his DNA and that of Hernandez, Bomberg said.
A footprint at the industrial park where Lloyd's body was found matched sneakers worn by Hernandez, the prosecutor said.
"As soon as they found out Aaron Hernandez -- a celebrity football player for the New England Patriots -- was a friend of Odin Lloyd's, it was over," he said.
The prosecutors will argue that Lloyd's killing was a "joint venture."
Close friend Daryl Hodge was with Lloyd when he said Lloyd got a text from Hernandez, asking to hang out later that night.
Hernandez pleaded not guilty in the shooting deaths of Ernesto Abreu and Safiro Furtado outside a bar in Boston in 2012.
