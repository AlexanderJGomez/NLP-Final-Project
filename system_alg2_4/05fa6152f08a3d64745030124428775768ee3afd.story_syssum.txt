Mills represented herself during the proceedings and was a "less than impressive witness" on her own behalf, Judge Hugh Bennett wrote in awarding her £24.3 million ($48.6 million) -- far less than the £125 million she had sought from McCartney in the dissolution of their four-year marriage.
A summary of Bennett's decision was released Monday, but Mills had sought to keep the full ruling under wraps.
Britain's Court of Appeals ruled against her Tuesday, and her lawyer, David Rosen, said she accepted the decision.

He ruled that Mills earned far less before marriage than she claimed, and far more while married -- and at several points in his decision, he wrote that Mills' ideas about their marriage were "make-belief."
Bennett found Mills failed to produce financial records to back up statements about money she claimed to have in the bank before marriage, which she said amounted to more than £2 million.
In one year, she earned £1 million ($2 million) from a single modeling contract, he wrote.
The judge said McCartney continued to grieve for his late wife well into his marriage with Mills -- and he suggested Mills misrepresented her case because she had been star-struck.
Bennett discounted Mills' claims that she was anything more than a loving and devoted wife in helping McCartney.
The judgment included £35,000 a year for Beatrice, £600,000 for Mills and £2.5 million for her to purchase property in London.
