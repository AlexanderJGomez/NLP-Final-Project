SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- The owner of Luscious Garage is wondering whether the electric wall outlet will be the "gas tank" of the future.
"The regular Prius is a gasoline dependent car; it doesn't get energy from anywhere but the gas tank," said Coquillette.
Coquillette expects to begin conversions to even more efficient lithium batteries soon.
"Gas becomes optional," with this conversion, Coquillette said.
The garage itself strives to be green, with much of its power coming from solar panels.
They don't endorse or discourage it.
Hartline said the Prius was not designed with any conversion possibilities in mind, but she said the company welcomes any technology that pushes the envelope on plug-in batteries.
Much more research is needed, she said, about how hybrid owners would use their vehicles.
â€¢ In what other ways will the energy infrastructure have to change?
People come to me and say, 'I want to do this right away,' " said Coquillette.
However, most U.S. electricity is created from burning fossil fuels -- about 70 percent, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency of the Department of Energy.
