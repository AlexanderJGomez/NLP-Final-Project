Until now, she's never read a book.
"It's something that they wanted for so many years, and they just had no idea how to start," said Matt Cusimano, a Peace Corps volunteer and a teacher at the primary school in Sandvoort, a village of nearly 200 people.
Since starting, he's been working with few resources.
There's nothing analytical about it.
That's why I was comfortable taking on a library project," Cusimano said.
Some villagers contributed by cooking for hungry workers, while others shelved donated books or painted.
"That is where I'm finding this happiness, grateful pleasure for this library because I know my daughter ... my children (are) going to learn a lot from it.
"The (people of the) village never had an opportunity to learn about a computer.
If you don't know how to read, you can't start a computer," Leitch said.
He gets lost in the fictional battles of "Pokemon" and "Power Rangers."
If you want to donate books for the people of Sandvoort, go to their Facebook page for information or to Better World Books.
