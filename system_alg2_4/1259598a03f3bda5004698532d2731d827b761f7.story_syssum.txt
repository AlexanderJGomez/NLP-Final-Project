--Anders Breivik was " a little bit surprised" that his attacks succeeded, his lawyer Geir Lippestad says Tuesday, adding that Breivik had not expected to get to Utoya Island.
--Police say they will announce Tuesday when they will publish the list of names of the victims.
Breivik says the deaths are the price the Labour Party had to pay for its "treason," the judge says.
"In my darkest moments, I think that rather than killing all those people, he should have taken his own life," the father says, answering a reporter's question about mental illness by saying: "There is no other way to explain it.
--Police say they are investigating Breivik claims that two other terror cells assisted him in the attack.
--Breivik is charged with two acts of terrorism, police spokesman Henning Holtaas says.
Ringerike hospital chief surgeon Colin Poole says he has never seen gunshot wounds like those of the victims from the island, and speculates the injuries were caused by expanding or "dum-dum" bullets, a hospital spokesman says.
