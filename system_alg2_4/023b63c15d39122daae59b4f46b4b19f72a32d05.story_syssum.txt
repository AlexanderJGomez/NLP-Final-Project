My job is to ask tough questions, but when it comes to faith, God, and religion, the more questions I ask in my quest for truth and understanding, the more complex the answers become.
That same rebellious spirit also led to things that definitely were not good for me, like hanging with the wrong crowd and getting into the type of trouble that I would rather not put in print.
My home life wasn't exactly going swimmingly, and this group really embraced me.
I started off at Westmont, a beautiful Christian college nestled in the heart of Santa Barbara, California.
As glorious and fulfilling as all that appeared, two years into college, the world became much larger to me.
It became the world of church, religion and faith versus the world of ideas, cultures, and philosophies.
"Do you ever feel somewhat schizophrenic about the relationship of your faith to the rest of your life?
I discovered I had too many questions about faith to pursue a life of ministry, but I felt good about this transition.
When it comes to God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit, those answers rest in faith.
In the days when I thought I was going to pursue a life of ministry, I experienced and felt many things that were unexplainable.
What was that?
Or just good karma for trying to lead such a generous and selfless life?
He and I definitely agree that the concept of God should not be dismissed as having no meaning.
So, where do I stand now -- 30 years after "finding God," questioning my faith, committing sins, seeking hazardous adventure and trying to love life and people to the best of my ability?
I guess I just love my exhilarating and torturous life.
