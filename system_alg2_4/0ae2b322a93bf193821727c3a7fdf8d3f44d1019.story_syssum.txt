To start, protesters say they're looking for answers about what happened to Freddie Gray, and why.
Police say when Gray saw police on April 12, he started running.
Baltimore Police union attorney Michael Davey told reporters Wednesday that officers had every right to chase Gray.
Protesters want to know exactly what happened in those 30 minutes, and say it's clear police used too much force when Gray was in their custody.
Union officials from the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3 say something happened inside the vehicle, but they don't know what.
Five of the six officers involved in Gray's arrest have provided statements to investigators, the Baltimore Police Department said Wednesday.
Protesters say police should be releasing what they know now.
Baltimore Police officials say they're being as transparent as they can about the case while their criminal investigation is ongoing.
The police union said it's 100% behind the officers and compared protesters to a lynch mob, accusing them of calling for charges against officers without knowing the facts of the case or giving them a day in court.
Some protesters say it's not the only time they've seen police brutality on the streets of their city.
"It should not be that way and it needs to be fixed."
We believe that these cases should be decided in court where proper time and attention can be given," the union said.
