(CNN) -- Hundreds of people were injured in Bahrain Friday, when rival groups clashed over an attempted march in the town of Riffa, a residential area where the ruling Al-Khalifa family lives.
Bahrain's ambassador to the United States took the unusual step of commenting on the clashes in Riffa, which he called a "sectarian conflict" between Shia and Sunni Muslim factions.
Only eight tear gas canisters were used to disperse the crowd, according to Nonoo's statement.
The attempted march in Riffa was organized by some of the more hard-line Shia groups among the government opposition.
The Shiite Muslim majority has staged protests in recent years to complain about discrimination, unemployment and corruption.
More than 500 people have been injured in Bahrain since the protest began, which human rights activists say is part of a wave of popular unrest crashing through the Arab world
