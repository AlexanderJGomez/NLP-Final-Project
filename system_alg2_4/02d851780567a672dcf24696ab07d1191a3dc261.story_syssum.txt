(CNN) -- Louisiana authorities said Tuesday they found the body of a missing 6-year-old girl, stabbed and stuffed in a trash can down the street from her home.
The Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office said Flugence, 20, often babysat for her.
Investigators looked at the garbage can during their first search of the neighborhood, so they know the body was put inside sometime after Saturday -- but they still don't know when, he said.
Normand said garbage collection in the neighborhood happens Tuesday mornings.
Flugence's brother Russell, 21, was arrested for obstruction of justice in the case, Normand said.
