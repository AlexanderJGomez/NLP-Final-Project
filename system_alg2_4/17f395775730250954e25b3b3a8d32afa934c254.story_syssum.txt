They claim the defendants have a pattern of treating non-African American officers harsher than African American officers, when it comes to officer-involved shootings of African Americans.
Both were African American.
"The City of Cleveland, through the other named defendants, and the other named defendants in their individual capacities, have a history of treating non-African American officers involved in the shootings of African Americans substantially harsher than African American officers," reads the lawsuit, filed Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.
The lawsuit comes on the heels of another high-profile police shooting in Cleveland.
In March 2013, the U.S. Justice Department announced an investigation into the use of force by Cleveland police, citing several incidents.
