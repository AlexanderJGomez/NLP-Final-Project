What makes this situation awkward is that President Barack Obama and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano have given tacit support to the Senate immigration reform bill.
Obama has said that a pathway to citizenship must be included in any reform proposal.
In June 2011, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton fired off an internal memorandum -- the "Morton memo," as it became known -- to all directors, agents and general counsel in the agency's field offices.
The Morton memo was heralded by immigration reform advocates as a major breakthrough.
I suspect that the reason for this hands-off approach was that the ICE agents, by racking up deportations, were helping the administration meet its goal of deporting people -- which it has done at a rate of more than 1,000 per day.
It did.
Crane should tell that to 10-year-old Stephanie Pucheta who, next month, will be spending Father's Day without her father, Julio Cesar Pucheta, who was deported in January.
Since he's been gone, I miss him every day.
This administration has been excessively cruel to illegal immigrants and their families.
Napolitano has said all along she wants to remove illegal immigrants, more and more every year.
Maybe, in trying to be both tough and compassionate, the entire administration is being duplicitous.
