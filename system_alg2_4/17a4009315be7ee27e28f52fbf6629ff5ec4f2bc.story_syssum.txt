(CNN)Shortly after the 10th anniversary of the Iraq War, paralyzed veteran Tomas Young spoke with me about why he intended to end his life.
He said he seldom left his bed and that he popped a dizzying assortment of more than 30 different pills every day.
He said he would refuse his feeding tube and allow himself to die.
Former television host Phil Donahue, co-director and executive producer of "Body of War," said Wednesday that Tomas and Claudia made a remarkable love story.
"Theirs was a true love like I have never witnessed before," Donahue said.
Donahue said he had been waiting almost 10 years to hear what he heard on the phone Monday.
Young had moved with his wife to Portland, Oregon, where, as he stated in his Twitter profile, he was a "happily married man who's happy to live in a medical maryjane state."
Cuellar told me then she was frightened at the prospect of losing her husband, but that she always returned to thinking about how difficult it was for him every single day.
And she did.
Young was a self-avowed atheist, but somehow I could feel him smiling down at his friends, glad that they were remembering him as a nice guy.
