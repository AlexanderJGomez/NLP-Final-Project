Two recent studies suggest that sexting is more common than many parents might realize or want to admit.
Another study, this one by the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, found that while students who admitted sexting were 32% more likely to report having sex the next year, sexting by teenagers was not linked to risky sexual behavior over time.
"There are now a few pieces of research, which are sort of converging on the same finding, namely that this is not a rare behavior," said Elizabeth Englander, a professor of psychology at Bridgewater State University and director of the Massachusetts Aggression Reduction Center.
"They had no idea what the consequences were," said Graber, co-founder of CyberWise.org, a digital literacy site for parents, educators, and tweens and teens.
She now plans to make it part of her "cybercivics" curriculum, and believes parents and educators need to be talking to kids at even younger ages about sexting.
Since half of car rides don't result in someone going through the windshield, a person might not listen to that warning, she says.
"So you can't say to kids 'Oh, you are going to go to jail if you sext.'
Englander said what she is most troubled by is not how widespread sexting might be but how teens feel after they sext, especially if they felt pressured to do it.
Lori Cunningham, founder of Well Connected Mom, a site specializing in simplifying technology for families, said parents need to remind their children about their own self-worth.
"If parents aren't having this conversation, their kids could be going through some tremendous pressure."
"Your kids can go into these things knowing absolutely nothing, having no idea of what you think is right or wrong, having no idea of the facts or you can talk to them about it.
"I don't think in today's world you can assume that they're never going to run across sexting, they're never going to see it, they're never going to know it happens."
