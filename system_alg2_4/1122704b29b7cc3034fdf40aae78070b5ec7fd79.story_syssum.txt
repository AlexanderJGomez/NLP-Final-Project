Jeb Bush's decision to step down from his advisory role at British bank Barclays at the end of the year became the latest indication he's gearing up to jump into the presidential race — and underscored one of the main liabilities he could face if he does run.
While Bush is seen as a top GOP establishment pick for the party's nomination, he's expected to face a fierce fight from the conservative wing of his party if he jumps in the race, particularly on immigration, thanks to his previous support for a pathway to citizenship, and Common Core educational standards.
But Bush's ties to Barclays point to another potentially prickly issue for him — his support for the 2008 Wall Street bailout known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which initially authorized $700 billion in loans from the U.S. government to the banking sector.
Other potential presidential contenders are on record supporting TARP, including Rep. Paul Ryan, who voted for it, and Texas Gov.
Conservative backlash over TARP and the health care reform law contributed to the 2010 Tea Party wave, and the Wall Street bailout remains a potent issue on both the far-right and far-left flanks of the major parties.
