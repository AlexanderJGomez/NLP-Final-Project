Taylor was found guilty last month of aiding and abetting war crimes in neighboring Sierra Leone's civil war.
Last month's landmark ruling by the international tribunal was the first war crimes conviction of a former head of state by an international court since the Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders after World War II.
His support for the rebels fueled the bloody war, prosecutors said.
He fled to Nigeria, where border guards arrested him three years later as he was attempting to cross into Chad.
Taylor becomes the first former head of state since Adm. Karl Doenitz, who became president of Germany briefly after Adolf Hitler's suicide, to be convicted of war crimes or crimes against humanity by an international tribunal.
