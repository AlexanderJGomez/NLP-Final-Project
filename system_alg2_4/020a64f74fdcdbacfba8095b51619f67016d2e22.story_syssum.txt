London, England (CNN) -- British police questioned four members of the Pakistani national cricket team after allegations surfaced that gamblers fixed part of a match against England, the manager of the Pakistani team said Sunday.
The video of the meeting -- which the newspaper said took place Wednesday, the day before the match between Pakistan and England began -- is intercut with clips from the following two days, where the players perform as Majeed said they would.
Without identifying the suspect by name, London police said Sunday in a brief statement that the 35-year-old man was released on bail "until a date in the future."
No players or team officials have been arrested, the International Cricket Council said Sunday.

England beat Pakistan in the four-day match at Lord's cricket ground, which ended Sunday afternoon, after the scandal broke.
Sam Peters, News of the World's cricket correspondent, told CNN that the tabloid did not "drive these events ...
"...
It is the second allegation of corruption directed at the Pakistan cricket team this year.
Andrew Miller, a cricket expert and the U.K. editor for ESPN's Cricket website, told CNN on Sunday morning that since a major scandal involving match fixing between India and South Africa in 2000, things appear not to have changed much.
Miller said though it remains to be proven, it appears this newest scandal could be on par with the scandal from 10 years ago.
And in a five-day test match, such as the one under way between Pakistan and England at the Lord's cricket ground, there are a lot of possibilities for placing bets that players can manipulate.
