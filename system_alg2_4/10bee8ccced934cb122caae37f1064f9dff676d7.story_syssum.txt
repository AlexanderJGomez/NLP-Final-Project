Court documents filed by Grammer -- a former "Real Housewife of Beverly Hills" cast member -- describe in dramatic detail an early morning fight with Charalambopoulos in a Houston, Texas, hotel where she was recovering from surgery two weeks ago.
"I wake up at least twice per night with visions of his face as he was attacking me," Grammer said in her filing.
The argument began at 1:30 a.m. on October 16 when she was awakened by the vibration of Charalambopoulos' cell phone "with incoming text messages and phone calls from another woman," Grammer said.
When Grammer began screaming for help, "Charalambopoulos squeezed my nose between his fingers and pushed upward forcefully, meanwhile covering my mouth in an attempt to silence me and to prevent me from breathing," she said.
"He told me I was going to hell, and then, to make his escape, he said he would 'knock (me) out' if I moved from the bed while he left the hotel," Grammer said.
Three minutes after he walked out, Grammer "hobbled down" four flights of stairs to the hotel lobby where an employee called police, she said.
