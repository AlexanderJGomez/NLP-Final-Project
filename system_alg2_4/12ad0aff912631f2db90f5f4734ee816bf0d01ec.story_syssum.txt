It escaped no one that a similar scene played out 20 months earlier when the Concordia first came to rest on the rocky shores.
He looked every bit like one of the workers and not at all like the big boss coming in from Florida.
Habib, himself a salvage master, stepped aside while the star of this particular show, Nick Sloane, the 52-year-old South African in charge of the Concordia salvage, and his key team took center stage.
Many of the salvage workers sat at the outdoor tables, just like they do after every shift and wondered just what all the fuss was about.
In fact, the people of Giglio see the rotation, or parbuckling, of the Costa Concordia liner very differently than the salvage team that pulled off the feat.
Many of them lined the hills above the wreck with binoculars and time-lapse cameras to capture the event.
Soggy curtains hung limp in the broken windows, deck chairs were imbedded into the stateroom walls.
It was a surreal scene, and one made even more poignant by the fact that the other half of the ship was still pristine white, almost as if the ship was wearing a half-white, half-black masquerade mask.
