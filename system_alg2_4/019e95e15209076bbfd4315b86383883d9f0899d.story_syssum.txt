(CNN) -- The family of Marlise Munoz has long said the pregnant Texas woman was brain dead, but now it has the medical records to confirm it, lawyers said Friday.
Munoz's husband, Erick, asked a court Tuesday to force a hospital to take her off a respirator, ventilator and other machines, saying her wishes shouldn't be disregarded just because she is pregnant.
The hospital referred requests for comment to the Tarrant County District Attorney's Office, which said it will defend the medical facility against the lawsuit.
Munoz's husband responded by saying that "Marlise cannot possibly be a pregnant patient -- Marlise is dead."
Lynne Machado, Marlise Munoz's mother, said Tuesday the family is not talking about the case but said she and her husband, Ernest, agree with Erick Munoz that their daughter would want to be removed from the machines.
Soon after that, she was taken to John Peter Smith Hospital, where Erick Munoz says he was told that his wife "was for all purposes brain dead."
"Marlise Munoz's death is a horrible and tragic circumstance, but by no means should (the hospital) be entitled to continue cutting into her deceased body in front of her husband and family under the guise of 'life-sustaining' treatment," the lawsuit says.
But just seeing that things look well isn't the same as saying that things will be well," he told CNN.
"And so I don't see how we can use a provision of the law that talks about treating or not treating a patient in a case where we really don't have a patient."
