Johannesburg (CNN) -- A stampede on a university campus in Johannesburg Tuesday left one woman dead and several people injured, according to eyewitness reports.
"There was a girl who tried to jump over the fence but unfortunately she tripped and the fence went through her from her back area so when the police came the people saw the police van as an excuse to jump over it to use it to go over.
Another witness recounted how a gate was opened "and then people started fighting and running towards the gate, and then there was a stampede.
"After it was a bit tense and we saw a woman lying there, a dead woman.
In a statement, the ANC Youth League called on the government "to urgently put in place measures that will remedy the situation of many prospective students and fewer admission spaces in institutions of higher learning not only in U.J.
(University of Johannesburg), but across institutions of higher learning in South Africa."
"The crisis is one of young people who want opportunities and struggle to get them.
