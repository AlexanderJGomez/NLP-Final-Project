(CNN) -- For those that love the luxury of first class air travel but loathe the imposition of having to share it with others, Emirates thinks it has the aircraft for you.
The Emirates Executive Airbus A319 can accommodate 19 people, with the plane divided into two main zones.
Mechanically activated tables can be raised in front of two large sofas, while one of 1,500 channels of in-flight entertainment can be watched on two 42-inch LCD screens.
It's certainly a more affordable option than buying a large private jet outright; an Airbus ACJ318 (similar to the Emirates Executive A319) or long-range Gulfstream G650 costs around $65 million from the respective manufacturers.
Although hampered by lack of airspace and facilities, in the coming years China is expected to see a 15% increase in number of private jets flying in its skies, according to Bombardier.
David Velupillai, marketing director of executive and private aviation for Airbus says that their jets -- from A318s to superjumbo A380s -- can be fitted out according to their clients' needs.
