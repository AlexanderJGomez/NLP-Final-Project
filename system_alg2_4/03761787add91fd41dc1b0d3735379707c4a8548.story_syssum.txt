(CNN)Valentine's Day is big currency in China, a nation obsessed with love, romance and dating.
Every weekend in China a strange, albeit charming, ritual takes place -- the parents of China's singles frequent their local park in order to match make on behalf of their children.
It's the perfect way to kill two birds with one stone -- meet your future love and your future in-laws.
It did raise one key dating point -- passports and permits matter.
They might even join on a date
The family remains the cornerstone of Chinese life -- and love.
They might join you on a date.
Then there's the common clich√© that Chinese women "marry up" and Chinese men "marry down."
The silver lining (if you're female, that is)?
Instead, they go by the putdown "third gender."
China now has the largest number of online daters.
Yep, you can do that online too
Do not despair -- there are now love gurus in China, who, taking their cue from American TV show "The Game," will offer men advice on how to successfully chat up women.
