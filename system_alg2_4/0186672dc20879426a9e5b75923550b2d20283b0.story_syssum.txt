New York (CNN) -- Like so many other people of my generation, John Lennon and the Beatles made an indelible stamp on my life.
At the time, I was a music journalist for City TV in Toronto, Canada, hosting "The New Music" program.
We were actively working with his record company, trying to set up an interview for a future edition of the program.

And I think the world would be better."
