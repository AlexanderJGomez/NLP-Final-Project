It started while I was doing research for a story on illegal animal trafficking, and I was reading books, including Dana Goodyear's "Anything that Moves" -- about how the American foodie scene is trending toward the bizarre and endangered (witness the 2010 bust of a California restaurant serving whale) -- and Jonathan Safran Foer's "Eating Animals," which argues, in part, that one cannot eat meat and also earnestly claim to be an environmentalist.
Since it's Earth Day, I thought that last point might merit some dissection.
As one of my Facebook friends was smart to point out, it's probably not a good idea to be in the business of telling people "what they are or are not."
Here are a few:
Animals are higher on the food chain than plants, and therefore they take more land, food and water to grow for our consumption.
(Chocolate, by the way, is actually worse than all of these, requiring 24,000 liters; but it's clear that a vegetarian diet is far more water- and energy-efficient than one that includes meat.)
Per capita meat consumption in the United States appears to have peaked around the year 2000 at more than 180 pounds of meat per person per year, or about half a pound each day, according to the Earth Policy Institute.

According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, eating a half-pound of beef creates more than 7 pounds of carbon-dioxide-equivalent gases.
So: Knowing all that, I would encourage you to consider giving up meat -- or even just one of the most resource-intensive meats, like beef -- for Earth Day.
But giving up meat for a day is an easy and meaningful one.
(I like TreeHugger founder Graham Hill's idea of eating meat only on the weekends; and singer Paul McCartney's idea of Meat Free Mondays.)
But one day?
But there are plenty of environmentalists who advocate a middle-road approach to meat consumption.
And it's one that -- even for a day -- can have real impact.
