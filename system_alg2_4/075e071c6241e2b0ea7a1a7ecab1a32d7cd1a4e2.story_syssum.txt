Limassol, Cyprus (CNN) -- Cyprus is known for its sunshine, its ancient ruins and its delicious halloumi cheese, but one thing that is less well known is that it is also home to the oldest named wine in the world.
Around this time, the Knights of the Order of Saint John renamed the local wine after their new protectorate.
Dimitris Antoniou, senior oenologist at KEO, believes the wine they produce is very special.
One distinguishing feature of commandaria is that after the grapes are picked, they are left in the sun for ten days, which increases the density of their sugars.
Archaeological digs, conducted over the past decade, have unearthed evidence that the history of wine in Cyprus stretches back not just hundreds, but thousands of years.
But when Lefteris talks of Cypriot wine, he speaks of "Nama", the more ancient name for what the crusading knights of the 13th century came to call commandaria.
Throughout his career, Mohianakis has worked in wineries around the world, and in his view, Cyprus is unique in its ability to grow sweet wine.
That is the reason why I strongly believe that Cyprus is one of the rarest terroirs that can produce such high quality sweet wines.
"I think that historians can tell stories and can give you an idea about the past, but senses cannot be transmitted through history.
I am just trying to give the vines the opportunity to express themselves through my wine."
