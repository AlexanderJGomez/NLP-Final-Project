Recently, the embattled comedian's attorneys filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit accusing the actor-comedian of sexually assaulting plaintiff Judith Huth in 1974 at the Playboy Mansion when she was 15.
A demurrer essentially says the complaint is so defective as written, that it should be dismissed His attorneys have also gone on the offensive, asking the court to impose sanctions against the attorneys who filed this lawsuit.
In real court, however, the rules are different.
Huth's attorneys should have complied with these rules.
While limitations periods are arbitrary, the public policy is not: defendants deserve protection of the law too.
Accordingly, some jurisdictions have special rules extending the time to file in cases of childhood sexual abuse.
Under California law, the only way that an alleged victim of childhood sexual abuse is able to bring an otherwise time-barred claim is to allege that the psychological injury was repressed and was only discovered within the last three years.
Huth was 15 years old in 1974 when the alleged abuse took place, and at least 55 years old when she filed this lawsuit.
That's why a plaintiff is prohibited under the rules from identifying the defendant by name until the court gives permission.
She didn't.
Even if Huth amended her complaint, Cosby's name is out there.
Recognizing this, modern jurisdictions have amended the normally inflexible statutes of limitations to allow victims their day in court, while seeking to protect would-be defendants from meritless claims.
But, under the rules of the Superior Court of California, this complaint should be dismissed.
