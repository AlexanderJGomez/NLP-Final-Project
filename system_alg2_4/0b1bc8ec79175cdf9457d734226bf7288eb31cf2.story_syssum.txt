Bensalem, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- About 100 vehicles were involved in a series of wrecks on the eastbound Pennsylvania Turnpike just north of Philadelphia on Friday morning, injuring at least 30 people and causing a traffic backup for hours over parts of two counties, officials said.
About 20 more sets of wrecks stretching for miles occurred on the turnpike, said Pat Ponticelli, Bensalem Township's deputy director of public safety.
"I think we really saw mostly what we would call soft-tissue injuries, bumps and scrapes type of injuries," he said.
Heather Pasco, a driver involved in one of the crashes, told KYW that she thought she was a goner.
Although she stopped, a truck behind her didn't, she said.
Police told her that her wreck was about 3.5 miles behind the initial crash, she said.
