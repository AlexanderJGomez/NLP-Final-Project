Marouane Fellaini, derided for much of the season following a nightmare year at Manchester United, headed home an equalizer with 20 minutes remaining after entering the fray as a substitute.
Its captain, Vincent Kompany, was born in Brussels to parents of Congolese descent, while Romelu Lukaku, the striker, comes from a similar background.
Arsenal's Thomas Vermaelen has spent most of the year as a substitute, while Fellaini has become a figure of fun following a number of disappointing displays at club level.
But in Feghouli, Algeria has a player who can mix it with the very best.
His strike, which came from the penalty spot after 24 minutes, might have sealed a historic win for an Algeria side which has never qualified from the group stage in its past three attempts.
Belgium, blessed with an array of attacking talent, looked stumped in its attempts to open up the Algerian defense.
Belgium's next game is against Russia on June 22 while Algeria takes on South Korea later that day.
In the group's late game, Russia came from behind to snatch a point against South Korea in Cuiaba.
Fortunately for Russia, Kerzhakov's strike ensured Russia avoided defeat after falling behind with 22 minutes remaining.
