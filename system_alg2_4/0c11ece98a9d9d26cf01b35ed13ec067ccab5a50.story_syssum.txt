Bob Greene recalls Farrah Fawcett's cheerful greetings to the crew every morning on a movie set.
"Morning!"
Farrah was one of the female leads.
She did her best to try to make the people around her forget just how all-reaching her fame was.
Most people in show business would do just about anything to possess that level of connection with the people out in the seats -- to move through life having everyone in the world feel they know you.
She understood that.
Farrah?
The movie itself -- it was called "Funny About Love"-- turned out to be quite forgettable.
I'd never been on another set.
Steve Allen, a luminary in the early days of television and a cogent observer of the world around him, said that when people see a person who is regularly on TV, it is as if the television performer emits a glow.
Donahue's point was that you're either famous or you're not; there's no in-between.
You're Sinatra.
Months after the final scenes were shot, I received a phone call from one of the producers.
"Farrah's not in the movie," he said.
I said.
Even when you're golden, it seems, life can blindside you and try to make you feel small.
"Morning!"
