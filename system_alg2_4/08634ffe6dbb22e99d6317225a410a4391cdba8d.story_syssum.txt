Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- A Florida teenager attacked and set on fire last month, allegedly by five teenage friends, was undergoing skin graft surgery Friday, the first procedure in his recovery, a hospital spokeswoman said.
On Thursday, three teens accused of setting Brewer on fire pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder, a public defender for one of the boys said.
Prosecutors say the three boys were in a gang that poured alcohol over Brewer, then set him ablaze in a dispute over $40, a video game and a bicycle.
Detectives say eyewitnesses told them that Mendez used a lighter to set fire to Brewer after Jarvis allegedly poured alcohol over him.
Detectives with the Broward County Sheriff's Office have been unable to interview Brewer.
Doctors say Brewer is improving but his condition is tenuous because of the severity of his burns and the possibility of infections.
"And he'll say, 'Am I going to be OK?'
You're going to be just fine,' " she said.
When Brewer did not pay, police say, Bent stole Brewer's father's bicycle.
They'll get theirs is all we can say.
A court-appointed psychologist who has examined two of the five boys allegedly involved in the attack told CNN they are competent to take part in legal proceedings and assist their attorney.
Psychologists also must evaluate whether the defendants can talk about what happened and communicate effectively with defense attorneys.
"It's a horrible event that occurred, but this was not their conceptualization, in my opinion, of what was going to happen."
