Subway Tokyo has an incredibly efficient subway, but the 13 lines are run by two different companies, Toei Subways and Tokyo Metro, meaning a bewildering variety of day passes are available.
Taxis During the day traffic can be gridlocked, but in the evening, when traffic is lighter, taxis are reasonably alternative to the subway.
ATMs Although Tokyo is ultra-modern, you may have to revert to carrying travelers' checks for the duration of your stay.
ATMs in busy areas stay open until 9 p.m. and most are closed at weekends, although Citibank has 24-hour ATMs.
Metropolis and Tokyo Notice Board are two of the best -- and they're both free.
- The Japanese don't pour sauces onto their rice.
