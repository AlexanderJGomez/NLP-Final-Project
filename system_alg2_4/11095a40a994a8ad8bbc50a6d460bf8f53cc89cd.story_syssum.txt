(CNN) -- The deportations of thousands of Mexicans who have served time in U.S. jails into Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, are adding a deadly ingredient to an already volatile state of security, Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz said.
Most of the recent violence has been committed by young street-level drug dealers who work for the Sinaloa or Juarez cartels, Reyes Ferriz said.
They end up in the city of Juarez, and that's a problem generated for us, but also for the United States."
About 85,400 "criminal aliens" were deported from the United States to their homelands in 2008, according to ICE.
Illegal immigrants whose only violation is entering illegally are not classified as criminal aliens, Zamarripa said.
The deportation flights from Arizona to Mexico are happening because it is a high-traffic area for illegal immigrants, and because that's where the government of Mexico agreed to the program.
In a recent conversation, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the United States would work to give Juarez more details about who is being dropped off on its doorstep, Reyes Ferriz said.
By comparison, the homicide rate in New Orleans, Louisiana, by far the deadliest city in the United States in 2008, was 64 homicides per 100,000 residents, based on preliminary FBI figures.
