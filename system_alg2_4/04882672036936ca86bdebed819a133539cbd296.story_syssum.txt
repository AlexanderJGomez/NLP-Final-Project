(CNN) -- The crew members of a North Korean freighter regained control of their ship from pirates who hijacked the vessel off Somalia, but not without a deadly fight, the U.S. Navy reported Tuesday.
The captured pirates were being held aboard the North Korean vessel, the Navy said.
After the crew regained control, Navy sailors boarded the Dai Hong Dan to help with the injured.
A second U.S. Navy destroyer was searching waters off Somalia for pirates who hijacked a Japanese-owned ship, military officials said.
The Burke's sister ship, the USS Porter, opened fire and sank the pirate skiffs tied to the Golden Nori's stern before the Burke took over shadowing the hijacked vessel.
When the shots were fired, it was not known the ship was filled with highly flammable benzene.

In June, the ship USS Carter Hall fired warning shots in an attempt to stop a hijacked Danish cargo ship off Somalia, but the American vessel turned away when the pirated ship entered Somali waters.
The pirates often are armed with automatic rifles and shoulder-fired rockets, according to a recent warning from the agency.
CNN correspondents Barbara Starr at the Pentagon and Christian Purefoy in Nairobi contributed to this report.
