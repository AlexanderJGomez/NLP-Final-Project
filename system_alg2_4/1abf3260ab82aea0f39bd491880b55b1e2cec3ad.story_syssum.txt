Exciting or frightening, these connected devices of the futuristic "smart" home may be familiar to fans of science fiction.
Mundane physical objects all around us are connecting to networks, communicating with mobile devices and each other to create what's being called an "Internet of Things," or IoT.
Many can communicate with their own apps and ecosystems but haven't found a way to play nice with each other.
Over the past four years, Qualcomm has been working on its AllJoyn protocol to connect devices from different manufacturers, even if they have different communication standards.
Many standards already help smart devices communicate, though none has emerged as a dominant option yet.
If there are too many different ecosystems, people will find a way to connect them -- much like how the problem of multiple phone chargers is being solved by micro-USB, she said.
It also sells the chips that will go inside smart thermostats, security systems, cars and everything else.
The first revolution was the connected Internet," she said.
Ben-Zur predicts the Internet of Things will be the third revolution.
But it's still to early to say for sure how all these devices will chat with each other and whether Qualcomm's AllJoyn or some other option will take off.
The exact killer apps for the Internet of Things are also a mystery.
"Exposing that, how your toothbrush and your water heater and your thermostat ... are going to interact with you, with your school, that's what's next," said Ben-Zur.
