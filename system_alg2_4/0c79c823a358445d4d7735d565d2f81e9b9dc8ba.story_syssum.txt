One top climatologist recently tweeted: "If even a small fraction of Arctic sea floor carbon is released to the atmosphere, we're f'd."
This Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people are taking to the streets around the world in the largest climate mobilization in history.
From the release of gigantic amounts of arctic methane gas, to the rapid carbon acidification of our oceans, to apocalyptic flooding, the continued warming of our planet is the greatest challenge our species has faced.
We can't afford to underestimate the massive footprint that humans have on this planet.
We need to shift our societies and economies off dirty energy and on to 100% clean, sustainable energy, within a generation.
But this change is possible - we now have the alternative energy technology we need to replace fossil fuels.
The question is not whether we will make this breakthrough, but whether we do so before it is too late.
And that is why the People's Climate March is so critical.
Saving ourselves by shifting our societies to 100% clean energy will require one of the largest, most diverse, and most sustained movements we've ever seen.
The Paris summit next year is when we'll need our leaders to sign a new global agreement.
If we learned one thing from the 2009 Copenhagen summit, it's that one global summit will never be a panacea.
But our civilization is the first truly global one, with the power to end human life.
For the sake of our children and their children, we must find the hope, wisdom and unity to save it.
