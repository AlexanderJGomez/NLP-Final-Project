Los Angeles (CNN) -- Cast members of the hit television show "Happy Days," who are suing CBS, accused the company of "despicable conduct" for not paying them for merchandising revenues.
Four members of the cast -- Marion Ross, Don Most, Anson Williams and Erin Moran -- along with the widow of Tom Bosley, sued CBS in April, claiming they have not been paid what they're owed for the worldwide sale of "Happy Days" merchandise.
"People loved 'Happy Days,' and it's been on everything from bedsheets to lunch boxes."
CBS said this was "all done in a transparent attempt to introduce the specter of punitive damages" in the case.
In 2002 and 2003, Moran contacted CBS about merchandising revenues but was told nothing was owed, the filing states.
Since the lawsuit was filed, CBS has sent checks totaling $43,403 in merchandising proceeds to the four actors and Bosley's widow, Patricia.
But in revenue statements sent to Pfeiffer after the lawsuit was filed, CBS did not include any revenue from four of those companies.
Here's one show and we're putting one of the biggest corporations in the world on the line to do the right thing.
