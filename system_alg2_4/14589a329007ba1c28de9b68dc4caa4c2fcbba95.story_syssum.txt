Airline industry experts insist standards of in-flight food are improving.
Not only was this a complaint letter par excellence, but it hit upon one of the most emotive subjects of long-haul air travel: the in-flight meal.
Miller acknowledges that there have been cut backs on catering across short-haul flights and a decline in spending on food in long-haul economy.
Standards have improved firstly as a result of greater competition between airline catering companies, says Miller.
Austrian catering company DO & CO has transformed the food served onboard Austrian Airlines and Turkish Airlines flights.
Good quality airline food not only depends on the quality of raw ingredients, he says, but also the intangible elements of good cuisine.
To inspire enthusiasm in its kitchens, DO & CO says it employs an unusually high ratio of chefs to work on a greater variety of dishes.
Austrian Airlines has won the Skytrax award for Best Business Class Catering for the last two years.
There is an on-board chef on every Austrian Airlines flight who puts the crucial finishing touches on premium-class meals.
Miller at SkyTrax is skeptical about the true benefits a celebrity chef can bring to onboard catering.
His work has since influenced standards across catering in all classes.
But on long-haul flights, airlines are restrained in what they can cut.
