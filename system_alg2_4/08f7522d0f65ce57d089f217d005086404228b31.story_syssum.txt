The complex, which processes and exports crude oil, natural gas, condensed gas and other products, survived intact, but the last export of crude oil was in March.
Some natural gas still is flowing to nearby power plants but gas exports to Europe stopped shortly after the revolution began.
In Tripoli, at the headquarters of Mellitah Oil & Gas, we meet Najmi M. Karim, the new chairman, appointed just a few days ago.
Karim says the company's facilities in the east and west of Libya suffered minimal damage in the conflict but officials in Tripoli still have not been able to establish contact with their El Feel oil field in the south where fighting still is ongoing.
For Mellitah, Karim says, getting workers back on the job is the first challenge.
"Having the workers back in the field requires some logistics support from an accommodation point of view, catering, transportation, all these kinds of supports."
At the complex, safety supervisor Abdulbaset Montaser instructs us to wear yellow safety helmets and hands us emergency masks in case of any danger.
Walking alongside the intense blue waters of the Mediterranean Sea with Mellitah's marine superintendant, Adel Sager, we gaze out at the now-empty pier where ships dock to load crude oil for export.
The dock stretches two kilometers into the sea.
But the skyline is empty.
