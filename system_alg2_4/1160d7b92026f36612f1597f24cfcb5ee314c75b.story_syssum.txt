NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- After months of delays the trial of the lone surviving suspect in the Mumbai terror attacks finally got underway Friday.
Police say Kasab is the only suspected gunman caught alive.
Nikam said, "The terror attack was in order to capture Kashmir."
Kazmi also argued that Kasab was under age at the time of the attacks and should be tried in Juvenile Court, but Judge M.L.
The court said it was brought to its attention that Waghmare was listed as an attorney for a victim of the Mumbai attacks who was seeking compensation from the state.
That victim also happens to be a witness against Kasab in this trial.
