Model Jean Shrimpton.
All eyes were on British supermodel Jean Shrimpton as she arrived at the prestigious Melbourne Cup Carnival -- or more accurately, all attention was focused on the 22-year-old's legs.
"She was one of the world's first supermodels and her visit was highly anticipated -- everyone was expecting this beautiful hat and accessories," Victoria Racing Club Art and Heritage curator Penny Tripp told CNN.
The face of "Swinging Sixties London" was flown to other side of the world to promote DuPont's new fabric, Orlon, during the four days of the Melbourne Cup Carnival -- Derby Day, Melbourne Cup, Oakes Day and Stakes Day.
DuPont quickly employed Melbourne milliner Adele Chapeaux to create a hat for Shrimpton's next appearances.
The model complied -- for one day.

"I think to the rest of the world, the Melbourne Cup probably looks like one big party -- and that's exactly what it is," said Angela Menz, the 2011 fashion competition winner.
"Head wear has been getting quite sculptural, almost like a piece of art on the head," she said.
The Melbourne Cup is as much about its fashion stakes as its horses.
