The Lexington County Sheriff's Department arrested Paul Thomas Rawl Jr. on Tuesday.
Major John Allard of the sheriff's department told CNN that the victim was never reported missing to his agency.
The warrant alleges he threatened to kill her with a loaded bow and arrow, and on one occasion, rammed her head so hard into a wall that it made a hole.
The sheriff's department said Wednesday night that it had no record of Rawl being represented by an attorney yet.
His victim in that case was a 12-year-old girl.
