When New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg appeared at a news conference Wednesday without Lydia Callis at his side, fans of the sign-language interpreter immediately expressed their disappointment via Twitter.
So sad Lydia Callis is not the sign language interpreter #Sandy" tweeted @kyledoyle.
"The time for relocation or evacuation is over.
When Bloomberg warned "It is dangerous," viewers could see the danger on Callis' face.
Newspaper stories and online blogs soon followed.
"As you can see from when I'm interpreting, you see the tree falling, you see the building, you see the crane moving around," Callis told Colvin.

"Lydia Callis has been replaced!
