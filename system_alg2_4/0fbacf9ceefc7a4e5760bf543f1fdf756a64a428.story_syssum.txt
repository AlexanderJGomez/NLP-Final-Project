Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) -- The children keep asking when their mother is coming home.
His eyes fill with tears as he explains his plight.
An 18-year Malaysia Airlines veteran, she loved to fly around the world.
Dozens of anguished relatives Sunday demanded that Malaysian authorities provide them with evidence of the fate of their loved ones aboard the missing Boeing 777.
While many of the passengers' families are staying together in hotels, Lee remains at his home waiting for information about the missing flight.
"The airline management only call us or have some briefing with us, you know, and then they tell us the same thing again as what the press conference told," he complained.
Amid the confusion, Malaysia said it has done its best with what it has.
Most of all he wants his wife to come home.
