Even before the ink on Ohio Gov.
The campaign to repeal Senate Bill 5, led by a group called "We Are Ohio," quickly went national.
Why all this national interest in an Ohio issue?
Well, in Ohio, all politics is also national.
Republicans managed to capture the governor's mansion and every other statewide office, 13 of the state's 18 congressional seats (a gain of 5 seats), and a majority in the Ohio House of Representatives (they already controlled the Ohio Senate).
Still, one can't ignore the fact that, in seeking to weaken public employee unions, the Republicans were also taking on the very groups who would be expected to bankroll Democrats in 2012.
The fear now among Republicans is not only that Senate Bill 5 will be repealed, but that organized labor in Ohio will emerge from this victory newly energized and better positioned to achieve its goals.
The voters of Ohio, however, did not just vote against the amendment; they also voted against the Republican Party that was seen to have backed the measure.
Kasich and the other statewide office holders who were elected in 2010 are not on the ballot this Tuesday, and in fact will not have to face the voters again until 2014.
Since no one has been elected president in more than 50 years without winning Ohio, it may well be that vote to repeal Senate Bill 5 in Ohio helps determine who will be taking the presidential oath in January of 2013.
