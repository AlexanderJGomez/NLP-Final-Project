The deal brokered by Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell does make good on President Obama's promise to bring a little more equity to the tax code by raising rates on wealthier Americans, and it temporarily averts the most draconian "sequestration" cuts.
So much for the idea that this whole struggle was supposed to help America get its financial house in order.
Just as bad, or perhaps worse in terms of the day-to-day lives of average people, the bill only postpones the forced cuts of sequestration by two months, to precisely the moment the country will be engaged in another ruinous debate about lifting our national debt ceiling to ensure the country can pay its bills.
The Senate package does not include any material spending cuts, infuriating those on the right.
Not only does it not address the $16 trillion national debt, it ignores the far bigger and more challenging deficit associated with looming retirement health care obligations.
The deal that was hastily cobbled together actually increases our deficit, and it creates an even bigger potential crisis just weeks from now.
One -- the one Washington will focus on -- is "who is to blame?"
One party speaks on behalf of one set of interests.
That may be fair, but it is also a distraction from the bigger point.
Both sides decided not to address it during the political campaign.
The fact that we even call the type of agreement that adequately starts to address our multiple needs a "grand bargain" as if it were some impossible dream reveals much about the current state of play in our nation's capital.
The two-party system is a boon for America when it is seen as providing a voice for two parts of a unified whole.
But then again, I never imagined a situation in Washington so dangerous to the well-being of so many Americans.
