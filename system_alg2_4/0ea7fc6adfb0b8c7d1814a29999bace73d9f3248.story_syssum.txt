Its aim is to do something about the more than 7,000 girls 17 or younger who get pregnant in New York City annually, with 90% of those pregnancies unplanned, according to the city's health department.
But it has gotten more attention of late, with most of it about the Plan B pill.
Mona Davids, the president of the recently formed New York City Parents Union, is firmly in the latter camp.
In New York, a person must be 18 or older to buy the pill over the counter.
The health department said recently, though, that only 1% to 2% of parents have done so.
"Kids are having kids, and that's the end of their education," said Frances Mejias, who said she wishes her daughter's high school had the program.
One New Yorker who strongly supports the program -- which, so far, has led to more than 1,100 students receiving birth control pills, including Plan B, according to the health department -- is its mayor.
But the mayor said lowering those rates even further is important, given the personal and academic costs of teen pregnancy.
"We've been doing this for a long time," he said.
