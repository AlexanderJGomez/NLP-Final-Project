Cruz is going to run from the right.
Cruz will test the conventional wisdom that Goldwater's strategy was and remains a failure.
And moderation in the pursuit of justice no virtue."
Although Goldwater was clearly wrong when he ran in 1964, Cruz thinks that the times have changed.
Even as the Republican Party has shifted to the right in recent decades, Republican candidates who have obtained the nomination, and those who have also won the presidency, always developed campaign themes that allowed them to appeal to broader coalitions than voters on the extremes.
This coming election will be tough for Republicans.
Some experts have predicted that Democrats have over an 80% chance of winning the Electoral College.
The Republican Party has been dragged down by the kind of politics that voters have observed in Washington.
This is the congressional Republicanism where Cruz comes from.
When Goldwater squared off against Johnson in 1964, the President predicted that there would be a "frontlash" of Republican and independent voters who would move way from the GOP just because Goldwater was at the top of the ticket.
The electorate is not as likely to experience any dramatic swings like we saw in Midwestern states in 1964, where solidly Republican areas went Democratic because they were scared off by Goldwater, but a Cruz campaign could be exactly what Democrats need to cement victories in the swing states where the outcome is still uncertain.
