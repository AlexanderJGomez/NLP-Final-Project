Civilians and opposition rebel forces have been left frustrated by the coalition's narrow focus, lack of a clear agenda and apparent failure to take into consideration the dynamics of the wider Syrian conflict.
In the short term, the international coalition's counter-terrorism strategy may certainly be in the interests of the Assad regime.
Coalition strikes have not been targeting the Syrian government's military forces or infrastructure.
Thus the Syrian government has found the U.S., Western allies, and Arab states on the side of its own allies Russia and the Islamic Republic of Iran -- aiding Assad against one of his most powerful and influential threats.
Although government forces have made slight advances in Aleppo, resource constraints have prevented the military from taking full advantage of the coalition strikes.
On a long term basis, the coalition strikes against ISIS in Syria will inevitably keep expanding, working to escalate the conflict.
Coalition training may gradually improve some of the Syrian rebel groups' military capabilities and strategic planning but the current balance of power between the government forces and various rebel and armed groups will likely continue.
In the end, both ISIS and Assad may be the beneficiaries of the foreign airstrikes, using them as a pretext to further advance their political interests.
