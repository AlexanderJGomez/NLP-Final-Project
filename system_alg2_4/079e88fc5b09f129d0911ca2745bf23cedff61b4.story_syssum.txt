Michael Vick will be confined to this Hampton, Virginia, house for the rest of his sentence.
Vick, who will turn 29 on June 26, pleaded guilty in August 2007 to a federal charge of bankrolling a dogfighting operation at a home he owned in Virginia.
A federal bankruptcy judge recently denied a plan presented by Vick and urged him to offer another plan to handle his debts.
The original plan called for Vick to come up with $750,000 to $1 million in cash to be paid to creditors, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Frank Santoro said, but he said he saw no evidence Vick could come up with that much.
In testimony before the bankruptcy judge, Vick acknowledged committing a "heinous" act and said he should have acted more maturely.
