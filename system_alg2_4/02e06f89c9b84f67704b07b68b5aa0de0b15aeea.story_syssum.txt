Tsipras has vowed to end austerity measures and renegotiate the terms of Greece's European Union bailout.
In return, the International Monetary Fund, European Commission and European Central Bank demanded tax hikes, a freeze on state pensions, bans on early retirement and deep cuts in government salaries.
"We are regaining our lost dignity.
European Central Bank Executive Board member Benoît Cœuré told CNN on Monday that Greece  would still have to pay its debt.
Greece has made remarkable progress in recent years, and we stand ready to continue to assist Greece in addressing the remaining reform challenges," he said.
After conceding defeat Sunday, outgoing Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said his conscience was clear.
"The tide is changing in Europe, the macro is improving in Greece, the European Central Bank is launching an unprecedented easing, and that will have a significant bearing on the fortunes of Greece going forward," Anthimos Thomopoulos said.
"Our victory is, at the same time, it's a victory for all the people of Europe that are fighting against austerity that's ruining the common European future," he said.
