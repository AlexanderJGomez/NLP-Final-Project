And now, at what would have been a few weeks from her senior year in college, Christian Minard finds herself expelled from school -- because the person she married is another woman.
In a letter from earlier this month that Minard shared with CNN, an administrator at Southwestern Christian University noted that he'd been told of Minard's same-sex marriage and saw pictures of it posted to Facebook.
Did Minard sign the school's morality covenant?

Located in the metropolitan Oklahoma City community of Bethany, Southwestern Christian University's website states the school's three core values are scholarship, service and spirit.
"We eventually fell in love and decided to get married," Minard said.
"Once I graduated," Minard said, "I was willing to go wherever life took me."
"And now I have a strong faith in God.
And I believe you can still have faith in God and live a gay lifestyle."
