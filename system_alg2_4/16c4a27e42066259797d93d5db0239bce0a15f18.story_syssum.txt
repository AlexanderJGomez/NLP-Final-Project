A disgruntled Abrahamian drops his bronze medal before leaving the arena during the presentation ceremony.
The IOC said Abrahamian violated two rules of the Olympic charter, one that bans any sort of demonstrations and another that demands respect for all Olympic athletes.
"The awards ceremony is a highly symbolic ritual, acknowledged as such by all athletes and other participants," the IOC said.
Also expelled for doping violations have been Spanish cyclist Maria Isabel Moreno and Vietnamese gymnast Thi Ngan Thuong Do.
A weightlifter at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics was stripped of his bronze medal after rejecting it during the medal ceremony.
Samadov later apologized, but the IOC upheld its decision to disqualify him, and he was later banned for life by the sport's governing body.
