Utah will reopen its five national parks by Saturday, as well as three other nationally run locations.
If the federal government shutdown ends before then, the State will receive a refund of unused monies" an official press statement explained.
October is an especially profitable month for Utah's national parks, since optimal weather attracts a high volume of tourists.
In the event that the federal government shutdown drags on longer than the 10 days that have been accounted for, the state of Utah insists it would be able to make additional payments to keep the parks operational.
