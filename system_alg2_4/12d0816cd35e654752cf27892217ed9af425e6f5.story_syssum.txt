The FBI joined the search for the killer of 3-year-old Riley Fox last month.
Fox searched for his daughter for 40 minutes inside and outside their Wilmington, Illinois, home and then called police, according to authorities.
Her body was found later that day in a river in Forked Creek, Illinois, just 4 miles from the family's home.
According to Zellner, Fox says that the night his daughter disappeared, he had gone to a street fair while the children's grandparents looked after them.
Fox has said the front door was wide open when he awoke, Zellner said, as was the back door.
"From the beginning, we believed that someone was already inside the house waiting when Kevin got home with the kids that night, " Melissa Fox said.
Indeed, five months later, Will County sheriff's officers arrested and charged Kevin Fox with the sexual assault and murder of his daughter.
"For weeks before her disappearance, I couldn't shake a feeling of uneasiness, strange noises at night outside our house, as if someone were lurking and watching us," Melissa Fox said.
Last month, the FBI joined the investigation at the request of Will County State Attorney James Glasgow.
The family is offering a $100,000 reward, and the FBI is offering $10,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for Riley Fox's death.
