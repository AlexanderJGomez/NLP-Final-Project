Natalie Dylan, 22, said she has put her virginity up for auction through the Moonlite Bunny Ranch.
But as to why men would bid so much money on virginity, she said she has no answer.
"I honestly don't know what they see in it," she said.
There's no right or wrong to this."
Through the 1950s in America, women were expected to remain virgins until marriage, Carpenter said.
Abstinence-based education programs also took off around that time, with government support, she said.
The new part is the Internet," Carpenter said.
Some think Dylan's auction may be indicative of a shift in the way society treats sexuality.
Kiara Daines, a 17-year-old from Detroit, Michigan, said she's saving herself until marriage for personal and religious reasons.
Many people say losing one's virginity has different implications for men than women.
The importance of a woman's virginity may vary in different cultures, but generally there's not the high value there used to be, Ray said.
Generally people have been supportive, Dylan said.
Honestly, even if I didn't do this, I'd always be the girl who thinks prostitution is OK," she said.
