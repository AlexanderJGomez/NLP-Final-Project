It was the first confirmation that the "Be on the Lookout" or BOLO lists used criteria targeting liberal groups after an inspector general's report made public last month said the IRS had used words such as "tea party" to determine possible extra scrutiny.
In a statement, the Michigan Democrat  questioned why the Treasury inspector general who initially disclosed the IRS targeting, J. Russell George, focused only on BOLO lists that contained conservative labels.
In response to Levin's statement, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Dave Camp said the inclusion of "progressives" on a BOLO list did not prove that liberal groups underwent the same extra scrutiny of conservative groups cited in the inspector general's report.
However, Werfel's review showed that other inappropriate lists continued to be used until as recently as this month by the unit that handles tax-exempt applications.
He immediately suspended use of any BOLO lists by the unit that handles tax-exempt applications, his review said.

The White House ordered the review by Werfel when he started the job on May 22 in the aftermath of George's audit that found targeting of some conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status.
The IRS admitted there was unfair targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status starting in 2010, but officials said the action was a bureaucratic shortcut in its Cincinnati office rather than an exercise of political bias.
As part of his review, Werfel said 80 groups awaiting IRS action on their applications for tax exempt status for more than 120 days could self-register with the agency as long as they certified under penalty of perjury that they would comply with applicable laws and regulations.
Confusion over defining what constitutes political activity versus social welfare activity contributed to the targeting by the IRS, Werfel said.
Werfel said the IRS would continue checking on tax-exempt groups to ensure they were following the law.
