London's Metropolitan Police said a 70-year-old man "accepted a caution for assault" at a police station Monday afternoon but did not name Saatchi.
"This afternoon Monday 17th June, a 70-year-old man voluntarily attended a central London police station and accepted a caution for assault," the spokesman said.
Sunday People, part of the stable of tabloids published by the Mirror Group, published the photos Sunday of Lawson and Saatchi at a restaurant.
"About a week ago, we were sitting outside a restaurant having an intense debate about the children, and I held Nigella's neck repeatedly while attempting to emphasize my point," Saatchi told the paper.
Nigella's tears were because we both hate arguing, not because she had been hurt," he added.
Lawson's Facebook page is filled with messages from fans expressing their support for her.
With the furor making headlines, UK domestic violence groups made the point that domestic abuse is an enduring and widespread issue.
Horley said that perpetrators of domestic violence "frequently try to minimize or deny their behaviour," but that violent incidents rarely occur only once and can escalate to more extreme behavior.
"Last year, almost 50% of the women we supported had been strangled or choked by their abusers."
