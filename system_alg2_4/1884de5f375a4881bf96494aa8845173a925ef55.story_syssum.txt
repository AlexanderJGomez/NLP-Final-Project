Perhaps that's why the man known for his extreme frugality and scruffy appearance decided in the years before his death that he'd do a little giving of his own.
"The estate of Robert Read made its first distributions to Brattleboro Memorial Hospital and the Brooks Library in the amounts of $4.8 million and $1.2 million," Read's attorney said in a press release.
After the garage was sold, Read could have taken some time to relax, but "he didn't take to retirement very well," Rowell said.
Though his jobs never yielded large salaries, Read enjoyed investing in the stock market, always putting his money into "dividend producing stocks," Rowell said.
Besides his frugality, Rowell described Read as a quintessential "Vermonter."
He was also a very private man.
