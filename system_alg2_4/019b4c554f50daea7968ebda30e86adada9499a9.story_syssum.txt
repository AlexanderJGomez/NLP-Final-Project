In the second quarter of this year, Portugal's economy outperformed many other countries in the European Union with growth of 1.1%, thanks in part to its exports, which rose by more than 5%.
As I get a tour of the factory, one of its co-owners, Jorge Ferreira, tells me the company has been in "pre-alert crisis since the 1970s"-- a time when the canned fish sector went into a deep crisis and many factories closed.
Ferreira says: "Our products are low priced and they have been the option for many people who have had their wages reduced, so in the last few years we have observed an increase in the quantity sold of our product."
To secure these key distribution deals, Jorge tells me he shows off the factory -- the canning process, the sterilization of the product and the fresh fish itself, which arrives at the port just outside the factory door -- to Chinese distributors.
Inside the factory she cannot feel the crisis; outside however, it's a different matter.
The coalition government may have known that it was too early to call this a turnaround, because they did little to play off these numbers.
As a result the government is expected to reveal a new batch of austerity measures when it announces its budget on October 15.
There are reasons to be optimistic.
For now, pate and bread may be the most appropriate economic aperitif.
