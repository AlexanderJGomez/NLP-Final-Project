Debbie Rowe said she married Michael Jackson to avoid the taboo of having childrien out of wedlock.
Rowe's lawyer said this week that she was not asking the Jackson family for more money in exchange for dropping a possible custody challenge.
"Debbie's a very caring, wonderful, warm person," said Marc Schaffel, who met first met Rowe when he worked for Jackson.
"I said, 'So, be a dad.'
'Let me do this.
You need to be a dad, and I want you to be.'"
Jackson later agreed to additional support.
Rowe gave up parental rights to Jackson in 2001, but she changed her mind more than two years later and sought temporary custody of the children.
"It's not that they're not my children, but I had them because I wanted him to be a father," she said.
"If one of her horses is sick, Debbie will stay up all night long caring for them.
"Debbie doesn't run out to all of the social events," he said.
Debbie is just as happy at home in her very modest, humble, horse ranch."
"She doesn't react well with the paparazzi," he said.
One letter sent Tuesday demanded the New York Post retract its report that Rowe had agreed to drop her custody claims for $4 million.
Rowe also filed a lawsuit this week against a woman who claimed in a TV interview to have e-mails from Rowe saying she didn't really want to raise the children.
