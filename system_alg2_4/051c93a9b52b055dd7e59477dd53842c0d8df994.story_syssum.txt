(CNN) -- Few female Chinese artists have attained the level of international recognition that sculptor Xiang Jing enjoys.
A seated, slouching and vacant-eyed nude woman with a scar on her abdomen, sagging breasts and fat rolls, critic Gao Shiming, a dean at the China Academy of Art, has described the work as an expression of "fatigue ... emptiness and helplessness."
Xiang says her work is always a kind of ongoing philosophical inquiry.
But, she says, "after a while, if you work on a deeper level, you will discover that whether male or female, you're ultimately dealing with human nature.
Raised in Beijing by an editor and film studio director, Xiang studied at Beijing's Central Academy of Fine Arts, graduating in 1995.
One of the first artists to make an impression on her was Tian Shixin, a sculptor from Guizhou whose work Xiang first saw when she was at high school.
"I don't think art is like design, when one can have an inspiration here or an inspiration there."
"Every time when I work on something, I would eat very little and sleep very little and become very, very thin."
Although her sculptures are strikingly lifelike, Xiang says she isn't aiming for realism.
"I want my art to awaken the sensibility of each onlooker, to awaken his body, so that his body can experience the sculpture.
And contemporary Chinese art has been born and developed within these last 30 years."
In fact, an artist heralded by critics and collectors as exemplary of exciting new developments in a still-developing world, says she often feels out of step.
The ways for us to get to know the world have become more and more diverse.
However, I think there should be another part that should look inward ... into an inner world ... a world that exists within us.
