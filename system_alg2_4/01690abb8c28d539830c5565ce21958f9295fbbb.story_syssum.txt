(CNN) -- The first patient to be diagnosed with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, in the United States is recovering well and should be able to go home from the hospital soon, doctors said Monday.
He told his doctors that the hospital had MERS patients, although he does not remember working with any of those infected.
No patients at the Indiana hospital had close contact with the MERS patient, who was in a private triage unit and admitted to a private bed on a general medical floor within three hours of showing up at the facility.
"There was a possible thought initially that it was pneumonia," or some other kind of respiratory virus, Kumar said.
Both the family and health care workers have all tested negative for the virus and all are on home isolation, officials said.
Doctors will run a second test on both populations since the virus is thought to have a 14-day incubation period.
The patient was not symptomatic at the time of travel, according to the doctors.
Scientists believe MERS spreads through close contact with a patient -- meaning someone would have to have come in contact with some of their bodily fluid.
There are no travel restrictions to the Arabian Peninsula; however, the CDC suggests people who visit there monitor their health and watch for any flulike symptoms.
"MERS picked the wrong hospital, the wrong state, the wrong country to try to get a foothold," said Dr. William VanNess, Indiana state health commissioner.
