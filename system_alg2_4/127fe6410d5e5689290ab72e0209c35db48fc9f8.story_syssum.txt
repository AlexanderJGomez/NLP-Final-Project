(CNN) -- A Southwest Airlines jetliner sustained substantial damage when its nose gear collapsed during landing in New York and it skidded down the runway, injuring 10 people.
Southwest, the largest domestic airline, did not respond to efforts by CNN to confirm the e-mails.
Kathy Boles, a passenger, said a "strong jolt" shook the cabin when the gear failed and the nose slammed into the tarmac at about 5:40 p.m.
Another passenger said it felt like the plane crashed and then skidded to a stop.
It was towed to a hangar.
Southwest said in a statement that it was working with the NTSB and Boeing.
Initially, the FAA said the crew reported a possible nose gear problem before landing but later amended that to say no issues were noted ahead of time after a review of air controller tapes.
Nose gear problems on commercial jets occur from time to time, but the crew normally would be alerted to any issue during approach by warning lights and would have time to abort a landing or come in on just the back wheels.
It has more than 600 of the workhorse aircraft in its fleet.
