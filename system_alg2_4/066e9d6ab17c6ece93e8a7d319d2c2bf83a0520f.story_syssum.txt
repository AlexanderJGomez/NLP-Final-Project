People in cars and on bikes whizzed by Moustafa Mohamad as he sat on a sidewalk in Washington one day not so long ago.
He hoped that somehow his presence on the sidewalk would help relatives and friends nearly 9,400 miles away, in his hometown -- the besieged Syrian city of Kobani.
A third told people how long he had been on hunger strike.
The 15th day of his hunger strike began like most others before that.
He and a supporter, a Kurdish activist from Washington, unfurled banners.
This one said "ISIS Slave Sale: $500.00 for Kurdish Women."
Most of the passers-by in Washington have no doubt heard news of the horrors ISIS has inflicted on people in Iraq and Syria.
Many of his friends and family lived in Kobani when ISIS attacked this year, he said.
He said ISIS also held two of his cousins for a time.
"Two of the boys who escaped told the media that ISIS was forcing the children to undergo lessons in Sharia and jihadist ideology, and one of these boys said that ISIS beat the children who misbehaved," Human Rights Watch said.
Thousands of miles away in Washington, Moustafa Mohamad hoped his hunger strike cast a spotlight on the suffering of people like the Kurdish teenagers kidnapped by ISIS.
On Day 18, a supporter surprised Mohamad with a rocking chair to replace his weathered folding chair.
On his 22nd day of hunger strike, Mohamad held strong, exclaiming, "My stomach has stopped ordering me around!"
So the next day, surrounded by friends and supporters, Mohamad enjoyed a bowl of lentil soup there on the sidewalk he had occupied for more than three weeks.
Mohamad mulled the question a few weeks after ending his hunger strike.
So he reached people that way, too.
