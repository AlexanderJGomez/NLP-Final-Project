Four of her children -- including Janet, Jermaine, Randy and Rebbie Jackson -- had taken their mother to an Arizona spa, but kept her whereabouts secret from their other siblings and Michael Jackson's children -- Prince, 15; Paris, 14; and Prince Michael II, 10, who's also known as Blanket.

There was a "scuffle" inside Katherine Jackson's Calabasas, California, home last Monday after Randy, Jermaine and Janet approached Michael Jackson's children in what witnesses said was an attempt to convince them to leave with them.
"Given the circumstances of the last two weeks, and in order to protect the children and Mrs. Jackson, the Executors believe that it would not be appropriate to allow the following individuals to enter the residence or its grounds and we instruct the security to preclude the following from entering the residence or the grounds: Randy Jackson and any of his children, Janet Jackson, Rebbie Jackson and any of her children, Jermaine Jackson, his wife and any of his children, Janice Smith, or anyone else who was involved in the recent events that led to Mrs. Jackson's separation from and inability to communicate with Michael's children, or any agents or representatives of any of these individuals," Weitzman wrote.
"Katherine Jackson is completely free to talk to whomever she chooses and is free to come and go from the house with anyone whom she chooses," Schultz said.
The list of people banned from the property was prepared by estate lawyers and sent at the request of TJ Jackson after "certain members of the Jackson family showed up unannounced at the ... residence of Michael Jackson's mother and children, causing a very public disturbance," according to a statement by the estate lawyers.
Prince, Paris and Blanket approved of the arrangement, Katherine Jackson lawyer Perry Sanders said.
