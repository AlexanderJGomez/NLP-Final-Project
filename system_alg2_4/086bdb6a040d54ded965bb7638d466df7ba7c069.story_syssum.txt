On Thursday, French president Francois Hollande told a delegation of professional French football club leaders he wouldn't abandon the government's plan for a 75% tax on salaries reaching more than a $1.35 million.
It's estimated the tax could increase their costs by up to 30%.
If it goes ahead it would France's first football "strike" since 1972.
But PSG could be at a further disadvantage in future given Monaco are exempt from French taxation laws and the principality club's tax expenditure would be $67.5 million less than the French champions per year.
"French teams will be at a disadvantage with regard to English clubs who only pay 40% tax," former Monaco chief executive Tor-Kristian Karlsen told CNN.
"Monaco and PSG have raised the popularity and exposure of French football outside France," added Karlsen.
"In the short term clubs would have to buy cheaper players for lower transfers and would pay lower salaries to avoid paying the 75%," said Karlsen as he outlined a grim future for French football.
And given France's economic problems -- it has only just emerged from recession -- some members of the French football community remain uneasy about the proposed strike.
"I'm not totally for (the strike) personally, what worries me of course is that there is this tax, but, all French people suffer from having to pay taxes.
