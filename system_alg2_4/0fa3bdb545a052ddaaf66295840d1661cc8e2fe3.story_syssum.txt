She said she did not witness any sexual abuse.
"You have to wait," attorney Joe Amendola said just before entering the Pennsylvania courthouse and calling witnesses for a second day.
Dr. Elliot Atkins testified that he had diagnosed Sandusky with histrionic personality disorder after interviewing the former coach.
Histrionic personality disorder is part of a class of conditions called dramatic personality disorders, which are marked by unstable emotions and distorted self-images, according to the Cleveland Clinic.
Early in the trial, Amendola implied that Sandusky would take the stand.
Ron Kuby, a veteran criminal defense attorney, said there has been a "tsunami of evidence against him" and suggested that the former coach should take the stand.
Prosecutors wrapped up their case Monday morning with brief testimony from the mother of one of the alleged victims.
The defense then opened its case with a former Penn State coach who testified about Sandusky's stellar reputation in the community.
The defense called five other witnesses who also said Sandusky had a stellar reputation in the community.
One told jurors that Sandusky -- whom he met, like many of the accusers, through the Second Mile nonprofit for disadvantaged youths that the ex-coach founded -- had threatened him if he told others about the abuse.
On Monday, prosecutors dropped one of the 52 counts against Sandusky because the statute he was charged with wasn't in effect on the date of the alleged incident.
