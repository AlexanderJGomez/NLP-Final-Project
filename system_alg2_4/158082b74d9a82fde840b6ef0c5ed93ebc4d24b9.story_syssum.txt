LONDON, England (CNN) -- Harry Patch -- the last surviving British soldier from World War I -- died Saturday at the age of 111, Britain's Ministry of Defence said.
He fought and was seriously wounded in Ypres, Belgium, in 1917 at the Battle of Passchendaele, in which 70,000 of his fellow soldiers died -- including three of his close friends.
After the war, Harry returned to his work as a plumber and later became a sanitary engineer.
They married in 1919 and had two sons.
Patch didn't speak about the war until he turned 100, the Ministry of Defence said.
In 1998, a television producer with an interest in the war talked to Patch, who then made the decision to speak of his memories, the Ministry of Defence said.
"In speaking about his experiences, Harry began at last to come to terms with his war, and was at peace with himself and his memories," the Defence Ministry said.
Patch later laid a wreath at Langemark Cemetery for the German war dead.
Patch wrote a book detailing his life in 2007, called "The Last Fighting Tommy."
Dannatt said.
