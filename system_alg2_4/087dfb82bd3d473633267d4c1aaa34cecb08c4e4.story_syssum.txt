Lawyers for McDonnell and his wife met with prosecutors in the city of Alexandria on Monday as the Justice Department sought clarity over previously undisclosed gifts given to the governor and his family by the chief executive of a troubled dietary supplement company.
It's between Republican Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, who has his own ties to the man behind the McDonnell scandal, and Democrat Terry McAuliffe, a heavyweight political fundraiser, businessman and close friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton.
It has been a stunning turn of events for McDonnell, a well mannered former star in Republican politics who rose from state legislator to Virginia attorney general to governor.
But things came apart this year over revelations about the first family's ties to Jonnie Williams of Star Scientific, a friend and campaign contributor.
Maureen McDonnell also bought stock in the company and promoted its products at a luncheon at the governor's mansion in Richmond.
McDonnell said he has already repaid Williams tens of thousands of dollars and said he has broken no laws.
Andrew McBride, a former U.S. attorney in Alexandria, told CNN this would be a very difficult case for prosecutors without clear evidence of a quid pro quo.
An ethics investigation of Cuccinelli's relationship with Williams cleared the attorney general of any wrongdoing but revealed that Cuccinelli put the executive in touch with an attorney who could help him win grants from a state agency.
