Already banned twice in his career for biting an opponent, the Uruguay striker was seemingly at it again in his country's key World Cup victory over Italy.
"Suarez is a sneak and he gets away with it because FIFA want their stars to play in the World Cup," Chiellini told Sky Sports Italia.
But Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez insists he did not see the incident when he addressed the press in his news conference.
"I didn't see that.
"There seems there is animosity against this football player," he added.
The Uruguayan, who plays his club football with Liverpool, was banned for 10 games in April 2013 after being found guilty of biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic.
At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, he deliberately handled the ball on the goal-line to deny Ghana a place in the semifinals of the World Cup.
"Before the game people in England laughed about my attitude over the last few years," he told reporters following the game.
He was voted Player of the Year by his fellow colleagues and also named as the journalists' Player of the Year too -- awards that reflected a feeling that Suarez had put behind him his troubled past.
Meanwhile, Italy coach Prandelli says he will step down following another World Cup disappointment.
Giancarlo Abete, the president of the Italian Football Federation, also announced his resignation while stating he hoped to convince Prandelli to stay on.
Los Ticos, which won both of its previous games, will play its next game in Recife on Sunday.
