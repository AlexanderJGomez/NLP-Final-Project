(CNN)A former U.S. Army enlistee who posted on Facebook about "the adrenaline rush" of dying in jihad was arrested Friday and charged with trying to detonate a car bomb at Fort Riley military base in Kansas, authorities said.
The criminal complaint said the FBI questioned him March 24, 2014 about comments posted on Facebook, such as, "Getting ready to be killed in jihad is a HUGE adrenaline rush.
NOT because I'm scare to die but I am eager to meet my lord."
Booker said "that detonating a suicide bomb is his No.
The plan was for confidential informants to build a bomb and for Booker to drive to Fort Riley and detonate it, the complaint said.
On Friday, the informants and Booker drove to what Booker thought was a little-used utility gate near Fort Riley, the complaint said.
He said he thought Booker would carry out his plan but did not contact authorities, the complaint said.
If convicted, Blair faces a maximum of three years in prison.
