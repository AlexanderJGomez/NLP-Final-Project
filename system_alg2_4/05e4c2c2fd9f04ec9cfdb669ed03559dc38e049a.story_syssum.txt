Now the Air Force figures it's time for drones to get a lot smarter, especially as they take off or land.
Planes in the air have to coordinate with Air Traffic Control for the order in which they can safely land, taking precautions not to get in anyone's way until it's their turn.
Drones can't.
On Tuesday, the Air Force Research Laboratory at Ohio's Wright-Patterson Air Force Base said it'll soon solicit engineers to design an algorithm to allow drones to "integrate seamlessly" with piloted planes for takeoff and landing.
But a capable algorithm would let the drone process Air Traffic Control information like basic airfield maps to know that there's no actual danger from the oncoming piloted plane.
As Wired mentioned on Wednesday, FedEx is starting to think about an airfleet of linked-up drones that can fly in formation at the direction of a piloted aircraft.
