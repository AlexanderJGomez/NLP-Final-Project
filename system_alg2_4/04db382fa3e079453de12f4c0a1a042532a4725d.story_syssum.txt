Reporters who had been hastily convened for the news conference, which took place outside the heavily fortified Green Zone where the U.S. Embassy is located, learned that the militia was releasing a man they said was U.S. soldier Randy Michaels.
During Saturday's news conference, the man was wearing a U.S. military uniform and accompanied by two members of Sadr's political party.
The man said he had been abducted in Baghdad on June 18, 2011, by "Yom al-Maoud under the direction of Sayyed Muqtada al-Sadr," also known as the Promised Day Brigade.
Maha al-Douri, a lawmaker and a member of the al-Sadr movement, said at the news conference that the man had been in captivity for nine months, consistent with the reported June 2011 abduction date.
Bahaa al-Aaraji, the head of Sadr's Ahrar political bloc, said the man was "captured in battles" but had no further information.
Another U.S. official with knowledge of Hultz, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he returned to Iraq in 2006 as a civilian contractor.
Sometime after returning to Iraq, Hultz moved into private business.
