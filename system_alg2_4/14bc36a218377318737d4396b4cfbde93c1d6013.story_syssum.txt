(The Frisky) -- Dan had a big grin in his profile picture, like he'd just said something super funny.
!
He told me about his knee injury, his love of almond butter and Alpine air.
Understated sexy 30-something outfit, yes!
It was.
he asked me, twice.
he asked, shoving pasta in his face.
"I try and avoid that getting raped and robbed in the park after dark thing," I said.
"I hate it when they do that," Dan said.
"Surely a strong, modern woman like you would like to pay?"
Dan asked.
I sighed and mentally scribed the "thanks, but no thanks" message I'd write to him tomorrow.
I had a lovely time last night.
But--
As is often the case in this fallen world, there is more that at least one of us--me--must say.
So.
I'm writing, though, because several factors--specifically, that phrase in my profile about me seeking "[someone] who'd like to move in that direction"; plus your frequent mentions of running; plus your markedly small dinner last night--leave open the possibility that you've decided to embark on and commit to a process of transformation.
Dear Dan, There are so many things I'd like to tell you.
Yeah, thanks for sending me that message.
Thanks.
P.S.
Dan doesn't deserve my heated words, or the three minutes of my life it'd take to write them.
I don't need a guy to tell me that.
