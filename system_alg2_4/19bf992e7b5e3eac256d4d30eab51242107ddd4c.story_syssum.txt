FORT CAMPBELL, Kentucky (CNN) -- The 101st Airborne's senior commander in effect ordered his soldiers Wednesday not to commit suicide, a plea that came after 11 suicides since January 1, two of them in the past week.
Suicides on Fort Campbell have to stop now."
"Suicide is a permanent solution to what is only a temporary problem," Townsend said.
Don't take away your tomorrow."
But Townsend's message -- called a Second Suicide Stand-Down event -- is likely to be ineffective, said Dr. Mark Kaplan, a professor of community health at Portland State University in Oregon, who has researched veterans' suicide and served last year on a Veterans Administration blue-ribbon panel on suicide risk.
"It sounds like an order," he told CNN in a telephone interview.
Soldiers who acknowledge they are considering suicide can suffer severe repercussions, such as losing opportunities for promotion and access to firearms, he said.
The role of alcohol too must be addressed if the rate of suicide is to be lowered, he said.
Using a simple battery of questions, you can suss out people who might be at risk, which is far more important than telling somebody, 'Don't take your life,' " Lichtenstein said.
The problem is not limited to Fort Campbell.
