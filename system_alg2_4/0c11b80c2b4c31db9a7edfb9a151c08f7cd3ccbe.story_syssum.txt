From the Swat Valley in the north to Sindh province in the south, as many as 15 million Pakistanis have been affected by torrential monsoon rains that have washed away villages and bloated rivers, authorities said Wednesday.
It said 1,588 people have been injured and 352,291 people have been rescued.
For many parts of southern Pakistan, the worst is yet to come.
And Pakistanis will be forced to endure the consequences of damaged infrastructure and crops lost to flooding for months.
Gul, who set up a temporary stall on the road, said prices of fresh produce, including tomatoes and cucumbers, have doubled.
He has already lost work and money is tight, but with the cost of food soaring, he said he and his family will simply have to eat less.
Although the death toll is lower, the 14 million people affected are more than those affected in the 2005 Pakistan earthquakes, the 2004 Indonesia tsunami and the January earthquake in Haiti combined.
Holmes said thousands of villages and at least 288,000 homes have been destroyed.
Millions of hectares of crops have been washed away in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (KPK), Punjab and Sindh, and seed stocks have been destroyed, "severely compromising the possibility to plant staple food crops in September for hundreds of thousands of farmers," Holmes said.
"Millions more are expected to suffer from the combined impact of continuing torrential rains and unprecedented water levels in the rivers," Holmes said.
U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates on Wednesday authorized 19 Marine and Navy heavy-lift helicopters to Pakistan to relieve six U.S. Army helicopters that have been taking part in flood relief since Saturday.
Gates said the Pakistanis will decide the speed of distribution.
Also Wednesday, Germany said it was increasing aid for flood victims to about $12.8 million.
"Whatever amount the U.S. will give as donation, we will give the government of Pakistan more."
Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari has taken much of the heat.
