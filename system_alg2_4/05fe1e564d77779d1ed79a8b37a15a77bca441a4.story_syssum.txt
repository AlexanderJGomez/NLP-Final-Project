(CNN) -- A 56-year-old married woman has won half of the second-largest Mega Millions jackpot in U.S. history and has taken the cash option, which after taxes, will be about $120 million, Georgia Lottery President Debbie Alford said Wednesday.
Alford gave a few details about Curry, saying she is married and had her daughter check online for the winning numbers after a radio announcer mentioned 7 was the Mega ball number.
It will take one to two weeks before Curry will get her check, Alford said.
Curry told lottery officials she hadn't had time to think about what to do with the money.
Twenty ticket holders will win $1 million after matching all the numbers except the Mega ball.
The prize rises with each miss, and no one had won it since organizers increased the pool of numbers to choose from -- making astronomical odds even longer -- in October.
The odds of hitting the jackpot, which were 1 in 176 million, are now 1 in 259 million.
It's now 1 to 75.
