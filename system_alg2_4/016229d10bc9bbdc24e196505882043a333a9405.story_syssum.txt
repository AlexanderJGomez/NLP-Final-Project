'Okhai Ojeikere to the world one last time.
Over the last five years, Silva has been working tirelessly to complete an extensive monograph on Ojeikere.
Silva recalls Ojeikere's passion and enthusiasm for the project and, holding it close to her heart, she says she's determined to finish what they had started together.
He was like a father to me.
Born in a small rural village in West Nigeria in 1930, Ojeikere would become one of Nigeria's most celebrated artists.
The 1950s saw a young Ojeikere searching for a vocation.
"You're getting a sort of history of Nigeria at a very important, transitional period, just on the cusp of independence," says Silva.
I'm a professional.'
This is when he started to take photographs with more artistic intent, explains Silva.
The "Hairstyles" series, for which he is so critically acclaimed, features over 1,000 photographs of Nigerian styles since 1954.
The images communicate a transition from the normal photographs depicting Africa, says Silva.
Silva's monograph is just one tribute to Ojeikere.
"As a Nigerian, he wanted to document that moment in Nigeria when it was a time of colonial rule changing over to democracy," says Fox.
He used photography which is a very modern medium to document these moments of social change."
