(CNN) -- On Friday, Pope Francis announced the canonization of two of his predecessors: Pope John Paul II (pope from 1978 to 2005) and Pope John XXIII (1958-1963).
The Vatican verified his first miracle, the curing of a French nun of Parkinson's, from which he also suffered, just two months after his death.
Why does a pope become a saint?
Over the first 1,500 years of Catholic history, people generally became saints through popular acclamation rather than through a formal papal process.
Pope John Paul II, in fact, oversaw the canonization of more people (483) than had been canonized in the previous 500 years, in part to lend the weight of Vatican authority to saints that had emerged throughout the global Catholic world.
By the time of the great medieval reform movements, most popes did not become saints and were not expected to do so, as sanctity became reserved for those not so deeply involved in worldly affairs.
John Paul II's sainthood has been promoted by many of the more conservative elements within the Catholic world.
