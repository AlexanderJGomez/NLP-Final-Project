Forstall, a senior vice president in charge of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS, will act as an adviser to CEO Tim Cook until departing some time next year, according to a news release from the company.
"When he says stuff, people listen."
The Apple press release did not say what Forstall plans to do when he leaves the company.
Federighi, the vice president of Mac software, will now oversee both Mac and iOS.
Almost universally lauded for its smooth, easily navigated design, iOS was dinged by many last month for a wonky Maps app and other problems.
"The amazing products that we've introduced in September and October, iPhone 5, iOS 6, iPad mini, iPad, iMac, MacBook Pro, iPod touch, iPod nano and many of our applications, could only have been created at Apple and are the direct result of our relentless focus on tightly integrating world-class hardware, software and services."
Forstall has been with Apple since 1997 and, in addition to guiding iOS, is one of the original architects of the company's desktop and laptop software, Mac OS X.
