Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said he doubts there would be a doctor that would think three consecutive life sentences "is not a deterrent," but admitted that there might be criticism that Gosnell didn't get death.
Judge Jeffrey Minehart, who rendered the decision, also sentenced Gosnell on Wednesday to 2Â½ to 5 years in the case of 41-year-old Karnamaya Mongar, who died of an anesthetic overdose during an abortion at Gosnell's West Philadelphia clinic.
Gosnell also was sentenced to 10 to 20 years each on two counts of conspiracy to commit murder.
Defense attorney McMahon, in an impassioned, 2Â½-hour closing argument, said said that none of the infants were killed.
McMahon said Gosnell knows that "some of his methodology was wrong" and that it was "wrong to perform abortion past 24 weeks.
David Misko said Gosnell is "more of a predator than a monster."
O'Neill, a medical school graduate, was not charged with performing illegal abortions.
A grand jury report from 2011 says the "people who ran this sham medical practice included no doctors other than Gosnell himself, and not even a single nurse," yet they still made diagnoses, performed procedures and administered drugs.
McMahon argued that Gosnell offered access to health care for people who were poor and without health insurance.
