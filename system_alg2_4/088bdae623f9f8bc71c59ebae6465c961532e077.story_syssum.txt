Coach Nicola Vaughan-Ellis with athletes from Great Britain's powerlifting team.
Our responsibility as coaches is to be the best we can be," Vaughan-Ellis told CNN.
In the run up to the 2012 Olympic Games in London, the desire to develop high caliber coaches is ramping up in the UK, said John Neal of Ashridge Business School, where Vaughan-Ellis took the coaching course.
But coaches also need to make sure they make the best decisions for their athletes.
"We prepare our athletes to be the best in the world.
The program is flexible so coaches can focus on the skills they want to improve.
Neal estimates that about 160 coaches have completed the coaching program since it was launched.
But in return, the business school gets a unique perspective on decision making that is fed back into its executive education programs, Neal said.
She says one of the advantages of the program is that it helps coaches deal with pressure by teaching them how to cope with and embrace change.
That's an invaluable skill in athletics.
