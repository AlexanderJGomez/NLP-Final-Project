For her, and many decorators who contributed to this week's "inviting bedrooms" Open House assignment, the feel of bedding is important.
Whether it's crisp, white sheets from a store like Target or expensive, vintage-looking throws from Anthropologie, decorators say it's important to feel like you're sleeping on a cloud.
Pillows are key, decorators said, and they must be chosen carefully.
"I think every bed needs several good pillows besides the decorative kind," said Clark.
"My husband and I love our Tempur-Pedic pillows that mold to the shape of our neck and head," she said.
"Don't do it!"
"I feel like a bedroom can be uncomfortable if it's too formal."
And according to the logic of most bedroom decorating schemes, designers say the bed and headboard are more important than the rest of the furniture.
CNN iReport head-honcho and home decor blogger Katie Hawkins-Gaar is similarly proud of the impact her DIY headboard has on her master bedroom.
"After making a custom headboard, it's like we have a brand new bed!
Clark also finds that lamps are an indispensable ingredient to an inviting bedroom.
Soft light makes a bedroom cozier, she said.
The only thing it seems decorators can't agree on when it comes to bedrooms is whether to put a TV in the room.
"I know for so many a TV in the bedroom is a big no-no, but I have to have a TV in the bedroom.
If you can swing it, no home office or TV in your bedroom."
