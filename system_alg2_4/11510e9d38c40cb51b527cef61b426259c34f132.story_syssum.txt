Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Large explosions and the sound of jets over Tripoli Thursday night indicated NATO has likely increased the intensity of its air strikes on Moammar Gadhafi's key command and control military sites.
NATO now has the use of armed U.S.
Rebels, who have complained that NATO was not being aggressive enough to protect civilians, said Thursday they had gained control of a key border crossing into Tunisia.
The Tunisian state-run news agency, TAP, also reported the rebel takeover of Wazen after early morning fighting.
Also Thursday, a third ship chartered by the International Organization for Migration made its way back from the besieged city of Misrata to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi in the east.
Another said, "US and UK with your loss, you shared with us the price of freedom."
France and Italy announced Wednesday that they will send military officers to Libya to advise the rebels.
Italy will send military advisers to train the rebels in self-defense tactics, Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman Maurizio Massari announced.
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday she has recommended that Obama authorize the U.S. government to send up to $25 million in non-lethal commodities and services to support Libyan rebels, including the Transitional National Council.
Clinton said Washington has "a lot of confidence in NATO" and is pleased with the performance of America's allies in the conflict.
At least 27 people have been killed and 142 have been injured in Libya this week, according to an opposition spokesman who wanted to be identified only as Mohammed for safety reasons.
Mohammed said rebels have "annihilated" Gadhafi forces and have defeated snipers in the city in the past few days.
