Oracle Team USA, the reigning America's Cup champions, have revealed their unlikely "secret weapon" in the hugely prestigious sailing race is Airbus.
"If you look at it closer, sailing and flying share a common DNA," said Airbus President and CEO, Fabrice BrÃ©gie.
And much like aircraft, these feats of design have rigid sails, rather than conventional material ones.
"The America's Cup is a boat race, but the design technology and engineering are very often the winning factor," said team skipper Jimmy Spithill, who knows what he's talking about -- he also has a pilot's license.
Back across the Atlantic, work has already begun collecting data on the Team USA boat, with over 300 on-board sensors providing real time information to a main server.
Much like its planes, Airbus will be analyzing the data closely.
Already, the company has introduced a ridged texture much like shark's skin on its plane's wings, to improve air flow.
And somewhere between sky and sea, the next America's Cup will take place.
