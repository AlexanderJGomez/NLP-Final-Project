London, England (CNN) -- Pop singer George Michael was jailed Tuesday to serve an eight-week sentence after pleading guilty to a charge that he drove while under the influence of drugs.
Prosecutor Jonathan Efemini told the court Tuesday that when police got to the car, they found Michael wide-eyed and appearing "spaced out."
Another London fan, Anne Fallon, 41, said, "It's really sad.
I hope he can get the help he needs."
Michael was found guilty in 2007 of unfit driving through tiredness and prescription medication and received a two-year driving ban.
Michael has used prescribed medicine for many years, Chawla said, and earlier this year decided to stop taking them completely.
"His creativity, so long hidden by the [drugs], is reemerging," Chawla said.
