Donna Rose says transgender people don't fit the stereotypes society often tries to impose.
He will go by the name of Chaz.
Transgender people -- that is, people who may not experience or express their gender in ways that are necessarily typical for the physical sex of their body -- have been part of the fabric of cultures for as long as history has been recorded.
Despite what others choose to believe, transsexual people are no longer relegated to hiding in safe little shadows for fear that society will detect them and punish them.
In a very real sense, transgender people are no one thing.
This is a journey that each of us is on -- trans and not -- and the simple fact of the matter is that the transgender journey may appear unique, but the end goal is a universal one: Happiness.
It may come as a surprise for many people in this country to recognize that many of us who are transsexual are not embarrassed, ashamed or otherwise apologetic of who or what we are.
This is not a journey about surgery.
It is not a journey about being "fixed."
Chaz will face hurdles.
Things are changing -- slowly but surely.
Because transgender people are here to stay.
These are not things to fear.
It is not one of becoming something you're not; it is of accepting what you are.
That is not something to fear.
