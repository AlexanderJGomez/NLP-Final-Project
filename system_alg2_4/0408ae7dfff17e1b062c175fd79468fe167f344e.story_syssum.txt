(CNN) -- Seattle Seahawks routed Denver Broncos Sunday 43-8 in one of the most one-sided contests in Super Bowl history to win the coveted Vince Lombardi trophy for the first time.
"This is an amazing team," Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said.
The franchise owner Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder, said it was an "amazing feeling" to win the 48th edition of the Super Bowl.
Manning shook his head as he returned to the bench and he proceeded to spend much of the opening quarter warming his seat as Seattle took a stranglehold.
Towards the end first quarter Manning was intercepted by Seattle safety Kam Chancellor at the Denver 39.
It was scarcely believable that a team which had set an NFL scoring record with 606 points in regular season had failed to make a 20-yard play during the opening half and Super Bowl history was against a team coming back from such a deficit.
It got even worse straight from the kickoff as the quicksilver Percy Harvin returned for fully 87 yards for the Seahawks to effectively end the game as a contest.
Seattle quarterback Wilson had played a quietly effective game and his pass found Jermaine Kearse, who eluded some more weak defense to add the fourth TD towards the end of the third quarter before Demaryius Thomas finally got Denver on the scoreboard.
By contrast, it proved a miserable night for his Denver counterpart John Fox, whose hopes of a reported $1 million winning bonus were in tatters almost from the first play, while the result will throw Manning's future in doubt, with talk of retirement.
