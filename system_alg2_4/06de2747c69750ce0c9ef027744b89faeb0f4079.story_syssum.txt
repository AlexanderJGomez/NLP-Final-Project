Egyptian authorities arrested Greste, Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Baher Mohamed of Al Jazeera English on December 29.
Mohamed Fadel Fahmy's brother, Adel Fahmy, told CNN that his brother's lawyer had confirmed he was among the defendants named in a statement by Egyptian prosecutors.
Adel Fahmy said the family was trying to stay strong.
The government is trying to save face, but they're making things worse.
Greste wrote in a letter released by Al Jazeera on Saturday that his detention was an attack on media freedoms.
The network did not say how it obtained the letter from Greste, who has previously worked for CNN, Reuters and the BBC.
