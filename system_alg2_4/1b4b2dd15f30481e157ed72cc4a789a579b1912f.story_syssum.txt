(CNN) -- A "faulty" flight instrument contributed to the crash of a Turkish plane last month in the Netherlands, an accident that killed nine people and injured more than 60 others, Dutch safety authorities said on Wednesday.
The plane was on automatic pilot when it crashed.
He said that if such instruments don't function, automatic pilots should not be used for landings.
In the immediate aftermath of the crash investigators said the plane fell almost vertically to the ground indicating the aircraft did not have enough forward speed.
Turkey's flagship airline is well-rated internationally for its overall safety record and the Boeing 737-800 has a good safety record.
