Paraguay's President on Saturday named a new interior minister and national police chief following clashes between police and peasants that left at least 17 dead.
Curuguaty Hospital director Gustavo Gonzalez told the state-run Paraguay Agency of Public Information that seven policemen and more than 10 farmers were killed.
Three of the police officers were flown to Asuncion for treatment, the official news agency said.
"All the resources of government security and strategic air are working at this moment to restore calm and tranquility to this region of the country," he said.
"I have ordered the armed forces to develop their specific mission in support of the police operation."
