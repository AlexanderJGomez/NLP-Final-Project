Paul Walsh, boss of the world's largest spirits producer, told CNN: "We have to have less regulation and more focus on a competitive edge.
"Europe continues to become a smaller piece of the overall pie," said Walsh, who is focusing on faster growth markets, such as Latin America, Africa and Asia.
"We have to do a far better job in educating our population on the imperative of staying in Europe," said Walsh.
Diageo won't be putting any pro-Europe stickers on their bottles; Walsh believes the educating should start within the business itself.
