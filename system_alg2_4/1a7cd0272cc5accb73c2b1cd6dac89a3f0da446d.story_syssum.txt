Since Apple introduced its iPad Mini on Tuesday, some commenters on CNN, Twitter and elsewhere have expressed skepticism about the need for the new device.
The Mini is slightly larger than rival tablets from Amazon and Google and about two-thirds the size of the current iPads.
In other news, Apple announced the iPad Mini today."
The original iPad and its first wave of rivals measured about 10 inches across, but more recent entries such as Amazon's Kindle Fire and Google's Nexus 7 have been 7 inches -- small enough to slip into a coat pocket.
"My conclusion: the iPad Mini will be for literary snobs, and the Kindle Fire will be for dumb-dumbs who read airport garbage books.
Kindle Fire owners will read E.L. James, and iPad Mini owners will read E.L. Doctorow.
The Mini weighs less than half as much as a full-size iPad.
"As for whether iPad Mini is an addition or a replacement for iPad owners, it's probably both," added Brunner, who has also worked at Apple.
"Some crazy people will want both, and some will find its size more compelling for everyday use.
"I COULD get the iPad Mini, or I could literally just keep using my iPhone and see no difference," said Krista Doyle on Twitter.
Then again, people in 2010 expressed doubts about the original iPad, calling it little more than a bigger iPod Touch.
