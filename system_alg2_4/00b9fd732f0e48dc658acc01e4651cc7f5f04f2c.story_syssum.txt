(CNN) -- Jeff Yeager says the economic downturn is an opportunity for people to simplify their lives and be content with less.
Jeff Yeager: Well, you know, I'm about 50 years old.
Collins: All right.
As a fellow Midwesterner, I share your cheapskate thoughts already.
And again, I don't really talk about a life of sacrifice.
You know, in this economy, we hear a lot of stories about how to get more stuff for 20 percent less.
Collins: OK. Wow.
Really?
Collins: OK.
Collins: OK. Well, very good.
I've got to push back for a second, because a lot of people will tell you you can be happier with a cell phone because you're out of the office and you're with your family more, still able to still do business.
Yeager: We can debate all that, but 10 or 15 years ago, none of us had it, and nothing awful happened.
All right.
Collins: OK. Give up meals prepared outside your home.
You can cut that by 80 percent by cooking those same meals at home and you know, maybe recapture some family time around the dinner table.
Collins: Yes, yes.
Yeager: Yes.
Yeager: And again, less than 2 percent of the clothes we throw away are worn out.
Collins: All right.
Back in my day, if you have a child in school, consider having them live at home while they go to school.
Now, of course, most kids go away to school, take out student loans.
Let's skip the money step!
