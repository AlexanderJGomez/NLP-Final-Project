(CNN) -- Kanye West wants his listeners to know that he is "a close high" to God.
'/I said "S*** I'm chilling/trying to stack these millions'/I know he's the most high, but I am a close high."

In interviews after the accident, West credited God with his survival.
He'd go on to pose on a 2006 Rolling Stones cover as -- you guessed it -- Jesus Christ alongside the headline "The Passion of Kanye West."
Like many talented artists, West said he was funneling his pain into his music, and despite the various styles he's adopted over the past nine years, religion has been a consistent topic in his personal and professional life.
"I just think God has put me in a really good space.
He added, "I believe in God, but I don't buy into any particular, specific religion.
I just believe in God.
