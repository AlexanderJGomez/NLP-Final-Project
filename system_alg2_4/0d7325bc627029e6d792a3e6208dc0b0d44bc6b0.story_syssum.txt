Nor is it about the board.
But in place of chanting "Close the university," on this occasion the students, faculty and others assembled on the quad claimed the right to open the university as their own and called for the right to select their own leader -- their own president.
In today's story, the students and faculty are saying that they are the university, an entity to be protected from a seemingly intrusive force: the Board of Visitors.
It was the crime of insult.
When the president was furtively fired without a legitimate process, we witnessed a back-of-the-hand slap by Marie Antoinette.
Process becomes substance.
In the case at the University of Virginia, the leader of the board, Helen Dragas, was exposed as having disregarded "the way we do things."
I cannot help to think how ironic it is that this battle has two women in opposition, Sullivan and Dragas.
In this case, the fact that the media have not made much about the women in the showdown demonstrates how far we have come in contemporary America.
