LONDON, England (CNN) -- French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner's declaration that France had to prepare for the possibility of war against Iran over its nuclear program was not conventional diplomatic behavior.
Kouchner is a humanitarian as well as a patriot, with a strong commitment to human rights.
Bernard Kouchner did not come to his position with any of former President Chirac's instinctive distrust of the United States.
But they are all of a piece with France's new high-profile style under the presidency of Nicolas Sarkozy.
Certainly Mr Kouchner is making clear that France no longer takes the view once expressed by President Chirac that a nuclear-armed Iran might be inevitable
Neither is saying that military intervention against Iran is imminent or inevitable.
