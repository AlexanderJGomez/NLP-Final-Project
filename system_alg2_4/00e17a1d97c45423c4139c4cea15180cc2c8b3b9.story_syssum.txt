The sublime scenery of the Shimanami Kaido (Island-Wave-Sea Route) runs from Onomichi in Hiroshima Prefecture down to Imabari in Ehime Prefecture.
Cycling gives you the freedom to stop for a photo halfway across a bridge or detour to investigate lighthouses, shrines and natural wonders most automobile travelers zip past.
As of March, Onomichi is home to Japan's first hotel designed exclusively for cyclists: Hotel Cycle in the Onomichi U2 building, just five minutes' walk from the JR station.
As for Onomichi itself, the town was built on a hillside overlooking the sea, so the best way to see it before you head onto the Shimanami Kaido is to catch the ropeway to the top of Senkoji Hill and enjoy the panorama.
You'll see the splendid Senkoji Temple, which dates from 806 AD, one of the oldest temples in Japan.
There are just 10 stools inside, so you may have wait a while.
Citrus-related products abound: cakes, jams, honey, sauces, juices.
As you breeze across the routes magnificent bridges (seven of them), a labyrinth of misty islands unfolds below.
Kosanji Temple on Ikuchijima Island is a must-visit.
Built in 1936 by Buddhist priest Koso Kosanji in memory of his mother, this wonderland of temples, pagodas and natural beauty took more than 30 years to complete.
Shinkansen bullet trains depart Tokyo regularly for Shin-Onomichi station -- the trip takes about 4.5 hours.
By car, the tolls are about 4,000 yen one way.
