Former flight engineer George Hopkins says he remembers vividly being hijacked to Cuba in 1968.
Pena Soltren is one of the men accused of hijacking Pan Am Flight 281 on November 24, 1968, and taking it to Cuba.
And he sticks a .38 right in my nose, right between my eyes, and I could tell it was loaded because I see the bullets around the cylinder.
"There was no doubt in my mind he would pull the trigger if I'd have done something very foolish," he said.
With the plane now heading to Cuba, the hijacker lowered his gun.
"He said don't worry about it, we've done this before," Hopkins said.
The hijackers left the plane after it landed, but Cuban authorities held Hopkins and the rest of the crew on board for about six hours before they were allowed to fly back to the United States.
Hopkins wonders now whether he would even recognize Pena Soltren.
This is the first time I've even said anything about it for five to 10 years.
