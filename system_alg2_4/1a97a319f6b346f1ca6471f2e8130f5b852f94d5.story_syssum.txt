He has a point -- gun policy is a back burner debate these days, largely because Democrats who had pushed for tighter gun laws concluded it's bad politics.
After the 1999 Columbine shooting, Democratic Vice President Al Gore played a central role in trying to pass ill-fated gun control legislation.
"Democrats finally figured out that this was an issue that they were getting walloped on in many Western, Southern states and many swing states," Manley said.
"For many Democrats, it's smart politics not to get into the gun control debate," he said.
But Senate Democrats wouldn't hold a vote, and Giffords' Republican colleagues in the House said at the time new laws were useless.

In the wake of the Colorado movie massacre, the NRA issued a statement steering clear of gun politics.
But the NRA is still active and not afraid to throw its weight around on topics that even tangentially involve gun policy.
When it comes to presidential politics, the NRA and the Obama campaign both know full well that he could win or lose re-election in battlegrounds like Virginia and Ohio, where the NRA has significant sway over some swing voters.
"You'll have us to blame for your defeat in November," he said, rallying the crowd.
