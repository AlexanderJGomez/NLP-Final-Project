By early Saturday, police were nowhere to be seen in the capital of Cairo, with military forces deployed on streets all around the nation for the first time in more than three decades.
"His time is over," the 19-year-old law student said early Saturday from Raml Square in central Alexandria.
"We haven't seen this many people on the streets at the same time."
When protesters circled the Ministry of Information in Cairo on Friday, they were greeted by police, who responded with sharp cracks of gunfire.
Mohammed Mansour, a resident of the Shubra neighborhood of Cairo, said that he and fellow demonstrators had been "beaten and assaulted by police" since Monday, when the popular unrest began.
In Cairo and Alexandria, many protesters greeted troops with embraces and cheers, some even shaking hands with soldiers.
"If the army comes out, that means the government ... is no longer in control."
The Muslim Brotherhood sent its followers onto the streets after Friday prayers, the first time Egypt's large and venerable -- but illegal -- Islamic opposition called for protest during this round of demonstrations.
"We are one of the richest Arab countries, and we want to live," said a 20-year-old student named Mohammed, whose last name was withheld to protect his identity, from Alexandria.
He said Egyptians should press on with their protests, following the lead of their fellow African nation Tunisia.
