"The reason the guys don't serve and volley is mainly because of the spin on the ball that is given by the string and also by the strength of the guys and their technique," Lendl told CNN.
"There are only a handful of guys that can do it right now -- Roger (Federer) being one of them," Lendl said.
"He used to (serve and volley), but I think the conditions of the grass have changed so much -- the balls are probably heavier, the courts are much, much slower, so there is far less serve and volley," Henman told CNN.
Sampras concurs with Lendl that the state-of-the-art equipment used by today's players has hastened the decline of serve-volley.
It's definitely a lost art, and it's unfortunate."
Sampras would not be the only one saddened if the era of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic -- so often hailed as a golden one for tennis -- also came to be defined by the erosion of one the game's most exhilarating skills.
