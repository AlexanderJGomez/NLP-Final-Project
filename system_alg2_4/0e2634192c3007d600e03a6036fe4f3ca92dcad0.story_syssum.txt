Mumbai, India (CNN) -- I normally don't dwell on what I am going to wear before I go on a shoot.
Knowing I would have to get close to human waste while filming, I opted for a pair of old water-resistant hiking boots.
I was not.
Ganesh Shinde, 42, has been doing this job since 2007.
He's a contractor who works for the city of Mumbai, earning just $5 a day.
I saw child after child carrying a mug of water come to the road where we waited with Shinde.
"Now I am used to it," Shinde says, admitting he found it hard when he first started the job.
Shinde has no gloves.
Those who clean gutters use bamboo sticks to clear jams, while standing in the middle of waste matter that can come as high as their chest.
Often, scavengers have to enter manholes too to clear blockages and it's not uncommon for them to drink a quick swig of alcohol before starting their job.
"They have to numb their senses," Shinde explains.
According to the Mumbai based research organization Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), 80% of the manual scavengers die before they turn 60 because of health problems.
Most manual scavengers are Dalits -- people belonging to the lowest strata of India's caste system.
Shinde says it's hard to get a cup of tea.
"It's just easier if I walk home," Shinde says.
"Not this work," she tells me, "no way.
India's current prime minister, Narendra Modi, hopes to change the future not just for Shinde's daughter but for millions of Indians who are forced to live with unsanitary and unhygienic conditions every day.
On October 2, he's launching a Clean India mission -- a nationwide movement that aims to solve India's sanitation problems in five years.
