Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court ruled for drug manufacturers Tuesday, deciding that a case brought by a Pennsylvania family who says their child was injured by a vaccine cannot be heard outside of a court created to hear such claims.
At issue was whether such liability claims can proceed in separate state courts, if the vaccine-related injuries could have been "avoided" by better product design and if federal officials had approved another, allegedly safer drug.
They claimed she was in fine health as an infant in 1992 when given a series of DPT shots -- a combination of vaccines to prevent diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough) and tetanus.
The family alleges another vaccine owned by Wyeth -- known as Tri-Solgen -- had proven in earlier tests to result in fewer potential side effects.
The "vaccine court" rejected the initial claim, so the family tried to revive the lawsuit in separate state and federal courts.
A federal appeals court eventually ruled for Wyeth, now owned by Pfizer Inc., concluding all design-defect claims were barred under the statute.
Wyeth and other drug manufacturers say their products are generally safe, but side effects can occur in very rare cases.
They also say the vaccine industry is generally not profitable, but the health benefits for society in general have kept them in the business.
The Georgia Supreme Court in 2009 became the first appeals court in the United States to allow families to sue outside the special vaccine court.
That case involved Atlanta-area parents who claimed their son, Stefan Ferrari, suffered severe neurological damage 12 years ago from booster shots by Wyeth and GlaxoSmithKline that contained the mercury-based preservative thimerosal.
Lawmakers at the time recognized the vaccine supply was suffering under rising company costs from potential liability claims.
The current high court case is Bruesewitz v. Wyeth (09-152).
