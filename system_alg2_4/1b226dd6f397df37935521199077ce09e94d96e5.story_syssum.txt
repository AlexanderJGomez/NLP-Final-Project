A man purported to be the notorious leader of the so-called Islamic State appeared at a mosque in Mosul, calling on people to carry out a holy war, according to witnesses and a video posted to the extremist group's website.
In the video, the man purported to be al-Baghdadi urges people to follow his call to create a "caliphate," an Islamic state, in Iraq and Syria, and wage "jihad" during Ramadan -- the holy month of fasting for Muslims that began last week.
During the sermon, the man said Muslims are sinners if they did not seek this goal of establishing an Islamic state.
Al-Baghdadi's appearance comes days after ISIS declared him as the leader of its new "caliphate," or Islamic state, extending from Aleppo in northeastern Syria to the Diyala province in Iraq.
The video identifies the man as Al-Khalifah Ibrahim, the name al-Baghdadi now goes by with his followers since ISIS declared the creation of the so-called "Islamic State" -- a move that enraged many Muslims.
"The emir of the believers, he will give the sermon," said one of the men who arrived with al-Baghdadi.
Those who accompanied al-Baghdadi took over the first row in the mosque, she said.
There were a number of gunmen who blocked the door."
He was released in 2009.
