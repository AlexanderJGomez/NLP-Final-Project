That blueprint will focus on manufacturing, energy, education and middle-class values, according to a video released on the Obama's campaign website and Democratic sources who have been briefed on the address.
Given the treacherous state of the economy, the president's campaign aides are attempting to make the theme of the upcoming election a choice about the role of government and the future of the middle class -- not a referendum on the president's handling of the economy.
One Democratic official said the president will offer to work with Congress if Congress agrees to work with him.
Democratic sources told CNN on Sunday that the bullet points of Obama's blueprint will focus on American manufacturing, including "insourcing" -- or bringing back jobs from overseas.
The address will include new proposals to prepare American workers and students for the jobs of the future.
Obama will also suggest job training for the long-term unemployed and veterans, the sources said.
"We can go in two directions," Obama said.
The day after the speech, the president will begin a three-day swing to states that are expected to be battlegrounds in the upcoming election.
