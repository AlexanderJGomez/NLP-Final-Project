(CNN) -- The mother of a 25-year-old woman killed in a Boston hotel more than a week ago said Friday that she will remain haunted by her daughter's death for the rest of her life.
Philip Markoff, 23, a second-year student at Boston University's School of Medicine, is charged with killing Brisman on April 14 at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel.
They say Markoff may have met her through the online site.
He has his family's support.
She was held at gunpoint and bound, prosecutors said.
McAllister said Markoff "is the wrong man" and "was set up."
Authorities believe the motive in Brisman's death was robbery, Conley told reporters.
The robbery was interrupted when the woman's husband entered the room.
