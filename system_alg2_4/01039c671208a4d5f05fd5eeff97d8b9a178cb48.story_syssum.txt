Facebook even created a help page just to say this: "Facebook is a free site and will never require that you pay to continue using the site."
And if you go over your mobile phone's data limit while using Facebook, you'll have to pay for that, too.
We will always keep Facebook a free service for everyone.
But a false viral story making the rounds may have some people convinced otherwise.
That was where the most recent "pay for Facebook" story originated, and it's where this doozy comes from, too.
In fact, the more cynical among us may think these sites are intentionally trying to drive traffic by pushing out seemingly real stories about hot topics.
The good people at Snopes, the Web's BS meter since 1995, are all over this one, as is PolitiFact.
So there's that.
What actually happened was that the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics held a September 18 debate on whether Pluto should be restored to its full glory and four days later released the results of a vote by the audience.
"The People Have Voted: Pluto is a Planet!"
"Pluto Is a Planet Again, According to Harvard Astronomers," another blog announced.
So, if you know otherwise, just don't tell us.
