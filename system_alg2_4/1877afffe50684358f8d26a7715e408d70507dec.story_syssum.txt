(CNN) -- Gunmen on a motorbike killed a Russian military instructor and wounded a second Tuesday in Yemen's capital of Sanaa, two senior police officials said.
The two victims were advising Yemen's army as private security contractors, said the police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Last month, a German security expert was shot dead as he walked out of a Sanaa supermarket.
U.S. counterterrorism officials have said that AQAP strives to attack targets outside of Yemen.
