That's the message from Eric Post, lead scientist of a new report into the effects of climate change on life in the Arctic.
The report found that flora and fauna of the Arctic are responding in various ways to the region's changes in climate over the last 150 years, and more recently the 20 to 30 years where seasonal minimal sea ice coverage has declined by 45,000 square kilometers per year.
The report found that some native Arctic species have also benefited from climate change, including wild reindeer on the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard.
With the decline in caribou comes a knock-on effect to native Inuit hunters, according to the report's authors.
said Post.
