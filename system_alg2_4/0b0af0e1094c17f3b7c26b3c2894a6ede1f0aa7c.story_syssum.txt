(CNN) -- Robert Redford says bigotry, fear of change and a determination to personally destroy President Barack Obama have paralyzed the U.S. government.
"At a certain point, I think, when things really get awful, when things get really bad and all seems to be lost -- there's no hope, there's no possibility -- then a lot of people quit," Redford said about his character.
"It's so divided now with the people that are so narrow and so limited that they would take us back into the past," Redford said.
I think it's a group of people that are so afraid of change, and they're so narrow-minded that some people -- when they see change coming -- get so threatened by change, they get angry and they get terrorized, and then they get vicious.
I think that's who these people are.
"They wanted, if it meant destroying the government, anything to keep him from succeeding.
But, unlike his latest film title, all is not lost, Redford said.
I've got to do something,' " said Redford, referring to the U.S. senator from Maine.
Women must save the country "because a lot of men that were in control were behaving stupidly," Redford said.
"I think it's time to give more women a chance."
