The U.S. should be prudent in exporting this natural resource, which has led to resurgence in domestic manufacturing, but I believe that the liquefied natural gas we do send overseas should be shipped on U.S.-flagged tankers and crewed by U.S. licensed and unlicensed mariners.
U.S. natural gas, globally, is abundant and cheap, making it an attractive commodity for other nations that are net importers of energy resources.
In 1951, we had 1,200 ships in the U.S. foreign trade.
Everyone agrees that the U.S. is the greatest naval power in the world.
First, recognizing at present that there are no American shipyards building liquefied natural gas tankers, how can we require such exports to be carried on U.S. ships that are not being built?
Opportunities must be seized when they become apparent.
We are a maritime nation, and we can build liquefied natural gas tankers in America.
