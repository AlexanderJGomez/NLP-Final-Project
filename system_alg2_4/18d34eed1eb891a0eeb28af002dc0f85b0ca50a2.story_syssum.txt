New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Authorities have completed an autopsy of Ram Singh, one of the men accused of gang raping and fatally beating a woman on a New Delhi bus.
He was murdered," Singh's father, Mangi Lai, told CNN affiliate CNN-IBN on Monday.
Last year, Tihar Prison recorded 18 deaths, including two suicides, according to CNN-IBN.
The gang rape, and the woman's subsequent death from injuries, prompted angry protests over the country's treatment of women and handling of sexual attacks.
Many Indian women have stories of sexual harassment and abuse on public transportation or on the streets, according to the Indian Council on Global Relations.
