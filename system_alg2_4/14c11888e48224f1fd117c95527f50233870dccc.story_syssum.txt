(CNN)  -- A paramedic accused of plotting to extort $25 million from actor John Travolta after his 16-year-old son died in the Bahamas told a jury Wednesday the boy had been dead for some time before the ambulance service was called.
Pleasant Bridgewater are on trial on charges they attempted to extort money from Travolta after his son's January 2 death from a seizure.
The paramedic, however, asked Travolta to sign a statement releasing the ambulance company from liability.
Time was of the essence," Travolta testified earlier in the trial.
In her statement, Bridgewater said she advised Lightbourn not to sell the document because she was trying to protect the Travoltas and the Bahamas.
Lightbourn said Wednesday that he asked attorney Bridgewater to assist him in negotiations with Travolta's attorneys.
Travolta's attorney testified the negotiations between Lightbourn and himself were all part of the Bahamian police sting.
Defense attorneys have attempted to convince the jury that Travolta's attorney came to the Bahamas to "set up" their clients.
Travolta and his wife, actress Kelly Preston, are not expected back in court.
