Isa Saharkhiz and his son Mehdi haven't seen each other in nearly a decade.
"He told me that 'you are released now,'" Saharkhiz said.
Since 2009, the younger Saharkhiz has led a one-man digital campaign from his home in New Jersey aimed at liberating his father.
Iranian security forces first arrested Isa Saharkhiz, 59, during the summer of 2009.
Security forces used brute force and widespread arrests to crush the street protests, while also rounding up top officials from Mousavi and Karroubi's political campaigns, including Isa Saharkhiz.
Saharkhiz later received a sentence of three years in prison for conspiring against the government and insulting the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
"They put me out without any shoes, any socks, and very few clothes."
As the elder Saharkhiz languished in prison in 2009, his son Mehdi became an opposition activist from the relative safety of exile in New Jersey.
His father was stationed in New York for several years in the 1990s while working for IRNA, the official Iranian news agency.
Four years after his arrest, the elder Saharkhiz said there was no formal reason given for his release.
Last month, he called for a negotiated end to Tehran's long feud with Washington over its nuclear program.
Though optimistic about Rouhani's presidency, Saharkhiz warned that Iran was a "double state," where true power lies in the hands of Supreme Leader Khamenei and senior military commanders.
"There's a lot of hope from what Rouhani did in the U.S. and there's a lot of good response from the people," Mehdi said.
"Maybe in a few years I will be able to go back, but it's a really big risk," he said.
"I will support freedom in Iran, and maybe criticize the leadership in Iran," he said.
"It will be a very emotional time," Isa Saharkhiz said.
