"That's where I was born, right under that tree," says Mhlongo, as he points out to a large ebony tree amidst the wildlife haven of South Africa's Kruger National Park.
Mhlongo, 49, is one of South Africa's very few senior trackers, honing the traditional skills of trailing animals in the Londolozi game reserve.
"That's the first thing people relate to but then I think people know South Africa's history -- they know the troubles we've come through and when they see two guys, one black, one white, that have connected on such a deep level, they like that and that shows South Africa has a lot to offer," he adds.
Today, Mhlongo and van den Heever use their vast knowledge and experience to pass on their Bushveld wisdom to younger generations.
Mhlongo says he is passionate about teaching his valuable skills to aspiring trackers.
"It is very important to share the knowledge with other people, to give them the same skills like we have," says Mhlongo.
