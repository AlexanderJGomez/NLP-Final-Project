Two others were killed, and a third person was injured in the hospital attack.
Dr. Jerry Umanos practiced medicine in inner-city Chicago before moving to Afghanistan in 2005, according to the U.S. hospital with which he was affiliated, Lawndale Christian Health Center.
He was always a light for Christ," she said.
Umanos worked at the Kabul hospital as well as at a community health center, the only two training programs for Afghan doctors in the country, according to his biography at Lawndale's website, which noted that he "felt called" to go to Afghanistan nearly a decade ago.
Two of those killed Thursday were a father and son, said Suraya Dalil, Afghan minister of public health.
"Any such attack on civilians at a hospital is despicable and cowardly," she said in a statement.
The CURE hospital in Kabul has about 100 beds and about 37,000 patients annually.
"Jerry and I worked closely for years to develop and implement training programs that provide local Afghan women with basic health education and skills to provide critical health services and best practices in their communities," said Evan A. Russell, a medical student at Johns Hopkins University and co-founder of Empowerment Health, a nonprofit group focusing on Afghan women and children.
And last month, five militants set off a deadly car bomb and then stormed a guesthouse used by foreigners in Kabul, the Afghan Interior Ministry said.
The militants held several foreigners hostage, including three Americans, a Malaysian and a person from an unspecified African country.
