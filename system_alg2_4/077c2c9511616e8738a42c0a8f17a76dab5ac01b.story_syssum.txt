In exchange for that flexibility, those states "have agreed to raise standards, improve accountability, and undertake essential reforms to improve teacher effectiveness," the White House said in a statement Thursday morning.
"We've offered every state the same deal: We've said, if you're willing to set higher, more honest standards then we're going to give you the flexibility to meet those standards," Obama said.
New Mexico also requested such flexibility from the No Child Left Behind law, and the Obama administration is working closely with that state.
And last month, Kline again criticized Obama for having "the audacity to circumvent the people's elected representatives by granting No Child Left Behind waivers with special strings attached," according to a press release from his office.
Georgia State School Superintendent John Barge described the waiver for his state as "wonderful news for Georgia's students, educators and parents.
Bush signed No Child Left Behind into law in 2001.
Secretary Duncan says the law drives down standards, weakens accountability, causes narrowing of the curriculum and labels too many schools as failing, the White House said in its news release.
To get the waivers, states had to adopt and have a plan to implement "college and career-ready standards," the White House said.
Based on standards set by the existing law, more schools were listed as failing last year than in any previous year since the law's passage.
"This is going to take some time, but we can get it done."
