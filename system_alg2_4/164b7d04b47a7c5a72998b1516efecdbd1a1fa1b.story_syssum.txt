The Nigerian government says that more than 200 girls abducted by Boko Haram in April are to be released as early as Monday, after it signed a ceasefire agreement with the Islamists.
Now, after the government made the announcement of their possible release, the hashtag has reawakened with messages of hope and anticipation.

Over the weekend, gunmen believed to be Boko Haram fighters attacked two villages and a town, killing at least eight and kidnapping others.

On April 14, Boko Haram militants raided the village of Chibok and kidnapped an estimated 276 teenage girls from a boarding school.
Three weeks later, a man claiming to be a Boko Haram leader threatened to sell the girls into slavery.

In spite of many promises to find and free them, the girls have remained in the terrorists' hands.
