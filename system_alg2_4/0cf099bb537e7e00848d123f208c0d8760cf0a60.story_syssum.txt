(CNN) -- By 2050, minorities will be the majority in America, and the number of residents older than 65 will more than double, according to projections released Thursday by the U.S. Census Bureau.
By 2050, 54 percent of the population will be minorities.
The projections are based on Census 2000 results and assumptions about future childbearing, mortality rates and net international migration, the bureau said.
The African-American population is projected to increase from 41.1 million to 65.7 million by 2050, going from 14 percent of the U.S. population to 15 percent.
The Asian-American population is expected to increase from 15.5 million to 40.6 million, or from 5.1 percent to 9.2 percent of the population.
Whites will comprise 46 percent of the U.S. population by 2050, down from the current level of 66 percent, the bureau said, as the group is projected to lose population in the 2030s and 2040s.
Meanwhile, the number of those age 85 and older is expected to more than triple, from 5.4 million in 2008 to 19 million by 2050.
Waddington said.
Of those, 235.7 million are expected to be minorities.
Of those, 39 percent are projected to be Hispanic, up from 22 percent in 2008, and 38 percent are projected to be white, down from 56 percent in 2008
â€¢ The working-age population will become more than 50 percent minority in 2039, and by 2050 will constitute 55 percent of the population.
And things like the baby boom generation couldn't be predicted."
