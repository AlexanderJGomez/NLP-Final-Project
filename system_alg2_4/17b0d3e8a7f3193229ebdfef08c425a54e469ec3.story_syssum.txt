In a series of books starting in 1976 and in his 2002 TED Talk, biologist Richard Dawkins has explored the implications of Darwin's work.
Dawkins argues that there is no doubt that Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection is true and, unlike some other scholars of the subject, says belief in evolution is not compatible with faith in religion.
There's no room for a God in the world as he sees it, and he believes atheists should be forceful in opposing religion.
Darwin himself was very slow to make his theory of evolution by natural selection public, taking 15 years from his early insights on the subject to the publication of the book -- and publishing it then only after naturalist Alfred Wallace had independently come up with the idea of evolution.
In an interview by e-mail last week, CNN asked Dawkins about Darwin and religion.
T.H.
Dawkins: Yes.
Dawkins: I think it stems from the far greater popularity of religion in America, but that only pushes the question back a stage.
CNN: You maintain that science is corrosive to religion and that religion undermines science.
Religion teaches us to be satisfied with non-explanations, and this is viciously corrosive of science and of the life of the mind generally.
CNN: You make the argument in the TED Talk for atheists to assert themselves boldly and overcome the cultural stigma against opposing religion.
Dawkins: Yes, I am happy to say I do think so.
