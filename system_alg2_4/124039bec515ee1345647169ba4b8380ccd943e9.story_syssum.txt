When I interviewed Dr. Thamer Al-Musawi, he told me his clinic is offering new hope to their patients.
Only two other clinics in all of Iraq have been given access to the same technology.
Round the clock medical care may not sound like anything special, but in Iraq, where the power grid is unreliable and blackouts are frequent, most clinics can open only a few hours a day.
Before we visited, someone tampered with a key circuit board and that's preventing the clinic from using electricity still being stored in the batteries.
He fully expects the solar panels will be powering the clinic again within a few days.
