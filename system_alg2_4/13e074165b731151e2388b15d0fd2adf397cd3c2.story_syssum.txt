(CNN) -- Researchers managed to create embryonic stem cells through cloning, a breakthrough in the field that was announced May 15 in the journal Cell.
While we are continuing discussions with the authors, we do not believe these errors impact the scientific findings of the paper in any way."
Neither OHSU nor Cell editors believe these errors impact the scientific findings of the paper in any way.
The researchers are also sending more information to Cell, including photos and original data.
Normally, an embryo is created when sperm enters the egg and it starts to divide.
But, in the Cell study, Mitalipov and colleagues began with skin cells from an 8-month-old baby that had a genetic disease.
Then, within several days, embryos genetically identical to the baby were created, from which stem cells were derived.
However, Mitalipov said the embryos created in his study, from skin cells and eggs, would not grow babies.
