The U.S. announcement came after North Korea recently threatened a pre-emptive nuclear attack on South Korea and the United States in response to stepped-up U.N. Security Council sanctions over its latest nuclear test last month.
Military and White House officials have said current U.S. missile defenses are adequate for the present level of threat, and President Barack Obama said in an interview with ABC News last week that he didn't think North Korea could carry out a missile attack on the United States.
But Hong said Monday that China believes that the anti-missile issue "matters to global strategic balance and regional stability.
The United States and other Western nations called the launch a test of ballistic missile technology, and the U.N. Security Council tightened sanctions on the regime in Pyongyang.
North Korea responded angrily to the U.N. measures, vowing to carry out its third nuclear test.
