Chaifetz posted the recording online Monday, which has since led to disciplinary actions, including the removal of at least one teacher, school officials said.
Chaifetz said he reached out to school officials to report the alleged actions of the teacher and her aides.
"The school district was as horrified as I was," he said.
He said his son can be heard screaming and crying in the recording.
CNN cannot independently confirm that claim.
