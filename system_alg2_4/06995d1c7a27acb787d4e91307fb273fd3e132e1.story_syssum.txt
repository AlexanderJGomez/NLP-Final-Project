Plate had already had the conversation about the drug with his daughter.
I know we all do stupid things as kids, but to have an outcome like this is dreadful," said Plate, one of the thousands of readers who took the time to comment on the CNN.com story.
What if that were my daughter?
While parents like Plate sympathized with the Bauers, others said it would never happen to their kid.
"Honestly, if my child was seriously showing signs of wanting to smoke pot, or even just try it, I'd probably buy it for them myself and make them do it at home, in a safe environment, just to make sure they're responsible," commenter Rob Doerr wrote.
Emily's stepfather, Tommy Bryant, welcomed the conversation because he wants to raise awareness of the drug, even if some of the comments weren't so kind.
While Bryant knows there will be critics and people out there questioning his parenting, he said he's just thankful to have more time with his daughter.
Why or why not?
