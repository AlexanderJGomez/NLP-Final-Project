Rock Hill, South Carolina (CNN)A South Carolina judge on Wednesday threw out the convictions of the Friendship Nine, who were jailed in 1961 after a sit-in protest in Rock Hill, South Carolina, during the civil rights movement.
"Offense: trespassing.
Retired state Supreme Court Justice Ernest Finney, who was the men's defense attorney in 1961, entered the motion to have the sentences tossed out.
I move for the convictions entered in 1961 to be vacated."
He went on to say, "The record is abundantly clear: There's only one reason these men were arrested.
It was wrong today.
...
The men, named after the Rock Hill, South Carolina, college that eight of them attended, were looking to make a statement about the plight of the segregated South.
On the morning of January 31, 1961, just after 11 a.m., the Friendship Nine arrived at McCrory's 5-10-25 Cent Variety Store in downtown Rock Hill.
Rather than pay the $100 for their release, the men felt they could make a more profound statement by accepting the full punishment for trespassing: 30 days of hard labor.
