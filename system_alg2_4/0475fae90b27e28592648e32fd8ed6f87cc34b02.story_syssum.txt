The president expressed dismay and anger over the bonuses to executives at AIG, which has received $173 billion in U.S. government bailouts over the past six months.
Obama was referring to the bonuses paid to traders in AIG's financial products division, the tiny group of people who crafted complicated deals that wound up shaking the world's economic foundations.

Obama said he would work with Congress to change the laws so that such a situation cannot happen again.
"I would suggest the first thing that would make me feel a little better toward them [AIG executives] is if they follow the Japanese example and come before the American people and take that deep bow and say, 'I am sorry,' and then either do one of two things: resign or go commit suicide," he said.
"There's no reason why those at AIG shouldn't do the same," he said.
You could write a tax provision that's narrowly crafted only to the people receiving bonuses.
The committee is trying to determine whether Congress can force AIG to renegotiate the bonuses, which the company says it is legally required to give employees under contracts negotiated before the company received its first infusion of bailout dollars in September, according to the committee aide.
Both aides said it is unclear what authority Congress might have to force AIG to take back the bonuses.

"Previously, AIG had agreed at our request to make no payments out of its $600 million Financial Products deferred compensation pool," he said.
"Finally, we demand an immediate status report as to whether the payments under the retention plan have been made," he said.
