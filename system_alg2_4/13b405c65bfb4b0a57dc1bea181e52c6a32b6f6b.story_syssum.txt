(CNN) --     More than 5,000 patients of a South Dakota urology clinic may have been exposed to hepatitis and HIV when the facility reused single-use medical products, state health officials said Friday.
"We witnessed the practice while we were in the facility," during a January inspection, said Barb Buhler of the South Dakota Health Department.
"They used the bags and tubing on multiple patients," Stahl said.
He said the workers at the clinic told the inspectors they'd been reusing bags and tubing since the clinic opened in 2002.
He said that the clinic had been inspected seven times since it opened, and no one had noticed that the clinic was reusing equipment.
Fluids from patients can retreat into saline bags and tubing while the equipment is used, and reusing the tubing or saline bags could put patients at risk for contacting diseases from previous patients.
