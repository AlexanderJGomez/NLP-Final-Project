Italian authorities also said two weeks ago that divers found what they thought were human remains on the ship's Deck 4.
Rebello, 33, was a cruise waiter who was last seen helping passengers off the ship.
Authorities say the ship struck the rocks off Giglio Island after the captain, Francesco Schettino, ordered the liner to veer more than four miles off course to salute a former sea captain who had retired on Giglio.
Schettino faces charges of manslaughter, causing a maritime disaster and abandoning ship with passengers still on board.
Schettino also has told the court that the ship would not have crashed had his helmsman turned it in the direction that Schettino told him to 13 seconds before impact.
