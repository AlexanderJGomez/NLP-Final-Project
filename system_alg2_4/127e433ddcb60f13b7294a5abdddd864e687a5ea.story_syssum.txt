Robin Stearns created a Web site to draw employers' attention to her jobless husband, Michael.
Then an idea came to her: Why not make him stand out by starting a Web site devoted to helping him find a job?
"He's such a great candidate, he would be an asset to any company."
The site features a picture of Robin Stearns holding a sign begging for somebody to employ her husband.
"Don't resort to the shotgun approach," Forster advises.
Michael Stearns said he plans to follow up on the job opportunities.
Robin Stearns, who declined to discuss her job because she wants to focus on her husband's job search, says a lot of their friends have been victims of the economy.
"At least until I get a job," Michael Stearns said.
