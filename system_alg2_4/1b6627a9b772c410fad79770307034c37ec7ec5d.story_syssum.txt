The free service lets users synchronize documents, photos and applications between Apple devices over the Internet.
When iCloud drops this fall, Apple will join Amazon.com and Google, two major players that have already begun rolling out storage services.
ITunes Match will allow people to pay $25 per year to sync as many as 25,000 songs not purchased through the iTunes Store between their computers and gadgets.
Amazon's Cloud Drive and Google's Music Beta require users to upload their entire libraries to each service before they can be accessed from Web and mobile jukeboxes.
Music files bought from Amazon can be automatically stored in a user's Cloud Drive.
Google does not have a music store.
ICloud will only store photos for 30 days.
Amazon's Cloud Drive can also store photos and video, but those files do count against a user's total.
Google Docs can keep a gigabyte of files free and charges 25 cents for each extra gigabyte.
Google also has an e-book store and has begun offering video services beyond YouTube for home movies.
Apple will also have websites for accessing e-mail, calendar and other features, as well as allowing Windows-PC users to sync photos to a folder.
