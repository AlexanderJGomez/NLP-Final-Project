The one movie I wrote in my mind a hundred times and on paper nine or 10 times, though, was "42."
Of course, it wasn't called that 20-odd years ago when I was under contract to be the Jackie Robinson biopic's screenwriter.
Well, once upon a time, I was encouraged to bring Robinson's life story to the screen, only to be discouraged by the way reel life turns out.
I spent many hours with Rachel Robinson cramming to learn details of the life they shared.
Who was I to do Jackie's story (and hers) justice?
The man I mean is, naturally -- well, not Jackie Robinson, but an equally monumental gent.
We fought to get it made.

In 1990, TNT airs one called "The Court-Martial of Jackie Robinson," based on an experience in the U.S. Army.
I spend all morning and afternoon in New York at the Jackie Robinson Foundation, conferring with Rachel and doing research.
I hear my producer tell my partner: "He's not putting in enough time on this!"
The producer wants it one way.
We write it both ways.
I read in Bill Rhoden's column in The New York Times that director Spike Lee is teaming up with Rachel Robinson to do a Jackie movie.
I had long thought Lee to be the right man to do the right thing by 42.
Cut to 1997.
Cut to 2013.
Rachel, you made it.
I give it thumbs-up and, hey, I haven't even seen it.
