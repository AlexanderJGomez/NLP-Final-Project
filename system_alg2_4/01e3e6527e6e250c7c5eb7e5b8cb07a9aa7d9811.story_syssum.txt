(CNN) -- As Michael Ballack finally calls time on his 17-year professional career, German football can bask in the knowledge they boast the best two teams in Europe.
"In Germany we have a situation now where Dortmund and Bayern are far, far more away from the other teams, and that's what we don't want to see in the Bundesliga," said Ballack, who has 98 Germany caps to his name.
Bayern Munich is heading away a little bit so we will see how it develops in the future."
"If you take Bayern Munich, they just bought six months ago Javi Martinez for $52 million, now Gotze for $49 million.
So that's a lot of money and it's not possible I think to do it for any other club in Germany.
But if you see this Bayern Munich team now, I can't really see where he needs to change.
"But on the other side, like I said, you can't really change a lot because everything works well.
Mourinho managed Ballack at Chelsea and has now returned to London for a second stint after his three-year tenure at Real Madrid ended in disappointment.
And Ballack, who won one Premier League title and two FA Cups in his four years at Chelsea, and three Bundesliga crowns with Bayern, says his time with Mourinho was a golden spell in his career.
What we have as players, is another picture.
And that's what I can say is special, because his attitude, his personality, if he comes in front of the group if he talks to us.
