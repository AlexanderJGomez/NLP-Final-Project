Federal authorities have filed the first criminal charges in the investigation of the deadly terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, people briefed on the matter said.
The investigation of the attack that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans  continues, these people said, as investigators try to build their case against Khattala and others who authorities believe were involved.
But people close to the case said the investigation has moved significantly in recent months.
The investigation is led by agents from the FBI in New York and has included some members of the Washington field office, who have traveled to Libya to interview hundreds of witnesses, those briefed on the investigation said.
U.S. law enforcement officials said it's not unusual for the FBI not to seek to interview defendants in a case while they collect other evidence.
"It's been frustrating for many of us that it hasn't moved faster, but it is a very difficult working environment for our agents," said Schiff.
But Schiff said there has been progress.
A lot of missing pieces still, but we are finally making progress," said Schiff.
