Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy, known as the "Lion of the Senate," died Tuesday at 77.
But Kennedy stood up to the Nixon administration in 1971 and alerted the world to the bloodshed that was engulfing then-East Pakistan.
The United States turned a blind eye to reports of atrocities committed by the Pakistani army to suppress the independence movement -- even as U.S. diplomats urged the administration to speak up.
Our government has failed to denounce atrocities," Consul General Archer Blood wrote in one of many telegrams from Dhaka to the U.S. State Department questioning American policy.
The report, "Crisis in South Asia," spoke of "one of the most appalling tides of human misery in modern times."
America's heavy support of Islamabad is nothing short of complicity in the human and political tragedy of East Bengal."
On December 16, 1971, Bangladesh gained independence after a 10-month struggle, in which 1 million to 3 million Bengalis were killed.
On the university campus stood a banyan tree where Bengalis student leaders had planted the seeds for the independence movement -- and which the Pakistani army had destroyed as a symbolic gesture.
During his visit, Kennedy planted a new tree there.
