Partial totals of what was spent so far show that between the candidate, his party and well-heeled outside groups, the "Red Team" spent more money on the effort to elect Republican Mitt Romney than the "Blue Team" did to re-elect President Barack Obama, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that monitors the influence of money on politics.
Combined, the candidate, the national party, and outside spending groups, like conservative issue-oriented nonprofits and super PACs, had spent more than $1 billion on Romney's effort.
No matter who spent more, Allison worries that the amount of money involved in this election will dramatically change politics.
Allison believes money may have made the most difference in congressional races.
"At the presidential level, candidates are able to raise enough money to get their message out and drive their own narrative," Allison said.
In a CNN analysis of spending in a dozen key Senate races, most of the candidates who won spent the most money.
After winning a bruising Republican primary, Thompson was seen as an early favorite -- partly because Wisconsin has recently leaned much more 'red.'
The primary had left Thompson cash poor while Baldwin was able to outpace him in fundraising.
Thompson raised $7.36 million and spent $6.04 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
The groups spent $15.5 million against Baldwin, $1.2 million for her.
In the Senate race in Indiana, for instance, Republican Richard Mourdock outspent Democratic opponent Joe Donnelley by about $7 million.
Mourdock ran a strong race, but took a hit in the polls when, at a debate, he made a controversial remark about rape and abortion.
Baldwin will become the first female Senator to represent Wisconsin and the nation's first openly gay person to win a Senate seat.
It looks like the money she spent on the race may have made a difference, too.
