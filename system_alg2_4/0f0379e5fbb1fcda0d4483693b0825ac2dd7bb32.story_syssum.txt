(CNN) -- Lionel Messi's sixth hat-trick of 2010 helped Barcelona demolish Almeria 8-0 on Saturday night, but three goals from Cristiano Ronaldo kept Real Madrid on top in Spain ahead of next Monday's "Clasico" clash between the La Liga giants.
Pedro embarrassed the onrushing Diego Alves eight minutes later as he easily won the race to a long ball in the 35th minute, then soon after Messi netted from the winger's low cross at the second attempt after the goalkeeper parried his first.
The home side had conceded only 10 goals in 11 games -- the third best defensive record in the league behind Real and Barcelona -- but coach Juan Manuel Lillo was sacked after the match.
Spain striker Llorente reduced the deficit five minutes before halftime from close range with his ninth league goal of the season, but Real restored their two-goal buffer 11 minutes after the break.
Aritz Aduriz put Valencia ahead in the 20th minute with a deflected shot as Villarreal -- who had won all five previous home matches this season -- conceded at El Madrigal for just the second time.
Valencia lost Lithuania defender Marius Stankevicius to a second yellow card with 10 minutes to go, but held on for the draw ahead of Wednesday's Champions League clash with Turkish side Bursaspor.
