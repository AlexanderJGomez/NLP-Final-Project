In his second debate with Mitt Romney, the president delivered a comeback performance that will stand as a model for future debaters of how to right a listing ship.
But by the end of the debate, he had checked off pretty much every item on his list of "Things I Should Have Done in Denver."
He appeared to draw strength from the 82 citizens on the stage, strength that grew as the evening progressed.
Clearly this was not the role Romney intended to play.
The town hall debate was a particularly inappropriate setting for Romney to display this side of himself.
Obama's big moments were more positive, especially, and unexpectedly, on the topic of Libya.
"It's not as big as yours," came the answer, "so I don't look at it that often."
The governor's response might have been written by the staff of "Saturday Night Live:" "President Bush and I are different people and these are different times," he said.
Before this debate, I wondered whether Obama would acknowledge the elephant in the room: his shoddy performance in Round 1.
