A: I don't like hockey.
B: I like hockey.
Me, I am B.
I grew up in Chicago, right now the hottest town on ice.
Why?
Because they don't lose?
That's how it looks in the National Hockey League's standings, at least.
A hockey game no longer can end in a tie.
So, even if you lose a game in extra time -- as the Blackhawks have -- you didn't "lose."
Hey, you obviously know your hockey!
The team is the talk of the town.
On national TV's sports news, the two smokin'-hot teams have been basketball's Miami Heat (beating almost everybody they play) and hockey's Blackhawks (kinda sorta technically not losing to anybody they play).
I do not know if you know who Chicago's hockey stars are.
He is from Stara Lubovna, Slovakia, where everybody probably watches him on CNN with no clue who LeBron James is.
Together with some sharp teammates, not the least of whom is Patrick Sharp, these guys have got Chicago rocking and rolling.
I checked with Jay Blunk to find out just how big things there are.
Tickets have become some of the hottest regular season tickets in history."
You see, it wasn't so long ago my boyhood favorites the Blackhawks were skating on (insert "thin ice" cliche here).
A popular team to watch had disappeared off the radar.
They had Ditka's Da Bears, followed by Jordan's Da Bulls, followed by a 2003 Cubs team that could have won the World Series and a 2005 White Sox team that did.
On the nightly news, sportscasters gave time to highlights from games of the Chicago Wolves, a minor-league team, almost as much as they did the Blackhawks.
The Blackhawks hadn't won a Stanley Cup since 1961.
I was a hockey guy.
So you can see, almost as exciting as winning 2010's Stanley Cup was, why the 2013 superstart of the Blackhawks is a sight to behold.
Hockey isn't for everybody.
