Motherhood has changed a lot since I grew up in the 1960s.
(My mom says she even smoked in the hospital after delivering my sisters and me.)
Back then, we didn't have playdates.
Lyz Lenz, a mom of two in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, says part of her wishes she was raising children in the early '80s, like her mom.
What's different today, says Joanna Mazewski, a mom of two in Coconut Creek, Florida, is the level of paranoia.
"Now you have attachment parenting, then you have 'tiger moms,' and people tell you to co-sleep.

Janis Brett Elspas, a mom of four in Los Angeles and host of the blog Mommy Blog Expert, said technology can be very powerful for parents today -- when it's used properly.
Another difference between parenting then and now, moms say, is a loss of freedom and independence during childhood.
Shannon Bradley-Colleary, a mom of two in Los Angeles who grew up in the '60s and '70s, remembers playing outside by herself as a kid.

"The reality is now we know more about what happens in the world ... so that obviously increases your perception of the world being much less safe," said Kaplun, the Miami mom of two.
We need to let our kids chart their own course and make their own mistakes, said Mazewski, the Coconut Creek mom of two.
What do you think are the biggest differences between parenting today and back in the '60s, '70s or '80s?
