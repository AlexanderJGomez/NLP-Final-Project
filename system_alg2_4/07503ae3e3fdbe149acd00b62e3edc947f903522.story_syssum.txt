One day after Ai Weiwei was released on bail, the dissident artist remained at home, unable to speak with anyone about why he was detained or what awaits him now.
Ai's release came without much fanfare.
A group of journalists and supporters gathered at his home and studio, hoping to be able to speak to him.
"I'm sorry I can not talk.
He also has accused the Chinese government of trying to silence dissidents.
Beijing police accused him of evading a "huge amount" of taxes, Xinhua reported in May, more than a month after he was detained.
Observers in Beijing said it may not be coincidental that Ai's release on Wednesday took place on the eve of Premier Wen Jiabao's upcoming visit to Hungary, Britain and Germany, where Ai enjoys wide support among artists and politicians.
Some Chinese netizens tried to camouflage their postings.
International reporting on Ai, including on CNN, was blacked out.
"He's got to keep quiet and behave according to the criteria of the Chinese police for the foreseeable future," Cohen said.
Beijing police told state media that Ai had been released on bail because of his good attitude in confessing his alleged crimes and also said he was suffering from a chronic disease.
Relatives and human rights groups said they believe Chinese authorities targeted him because of his irreverent commentary on modern Chinese society, though the Chinese government denied his activism had anything to do with his detention.
