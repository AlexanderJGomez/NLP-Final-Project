(CNN) -- More than 12,000 California prison inmates are now taking part in a hunger strike launched to demand better conditions and a reduction in the use of solitary confinement, corrections officials and organizers said Thursday.
Inmate demands include an end to long-term solitary confinement and halting what's known as the "debriefing" policy, in which inmates are required to provide information on prison gangs to get out of solitary.
The Corrections Department said the strike is organized by prison gangs and that inmates will face disciplinary action for taking part.
"Mass hunger strikes, work stoppages and other disruptions have the potential to impact programs, operations, staffing, safety and security," a statement from the agency read.
