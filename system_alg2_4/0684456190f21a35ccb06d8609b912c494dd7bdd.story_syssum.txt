"I can announce to you that, after a successful police raid against the terrorists hiding out in Jakarta yesterday, we can confirm that one of those that was killed was Mr. Dulmatin, one of the top southeast Asian terrorists that we have been looking for," Yudhoyono said.
Indonesian media had been reporting that Dulmatin was killed in a shootout in Pamulang, Banten province, on Tuesday.
Police have arrested 15 suspected militants, and one has been killed.
He said militants were seeking to establish camps similar to those run by Jemaah Islamiyah in the the southern Philippines.
