Nance, a third-year student at the Art Institute of Dallas, was found stabbed to death Saturday in her apartment.
"She was a very talented animation student," Stockton said.
Nance beat out about 60 other applicants to win the partial scholarship to the institute, Stockton said.
Eugene Reyes said officers entered her apartment Saturday and found her body.
Reyes said officers are in the process of interviewing people.
"We are waiting for DNA."
"It's just a tragedy."
