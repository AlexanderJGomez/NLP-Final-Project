Thomas Perez has climbed America's "ladder of opportunity" and now can help others do the same, President Barack Obama said on Monday in nominating the assistant U.S. attorney general as labor secretary.
Perez's nomination comes as the economy continues a sluggish recovery from recession, with unemployment hovering near 8%.
Obama and Democrats call for a combination of stimulus spending, budget cuts and reforms to the tax system and entitlement programs to reduce chronic federal deficits and debt while maintaining government support for education, research and other areas they consider vital to economic development.
In nominating Perez, Obama called on him to continue efforts by Solis and her team on helping returning war veterans get jobs, improving worker safety in coal mines and other steps to strengthen workers' rights.
"Mr. Perez has also had a controversial tenure at the Department of Justice where he has demonstrated a fundamentally political approach to the law."
Perez, who has overseen the agency's civil rights division, has been active in several high-profile cases in recent years.
Perez also became involved in a controversial 2008 voting rights case after it drew attention from Republican legislators and became the target of a Justice Department inspector general's report.
Though Perez had not yet been confirmed to oversee the civil rights division when the decision was made, he said in testimony to Inspector General Michael Horowitz in May 2010 that politics played no part in the decision.
Before rising to the Justice Department position, Perez led Maryland's Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation.
