Elizabeth Alexander says poetry can help solve problems by looking at them from a fresh angle.
After the president's speech, Elizabeth Alexander will read a poem she is writing for the occasion.
to get from here to there.
Alexander: I think that the fact that President-elect Obama has decided to have a poem in this ceremony is a wonderful affirmation to the power of language, the way in which poetry gives us distilled and mindful and careful language that can both give us a moment of pause, a moment of contemplation and that can also ... look at the world from a slightly different angle.
...
Alexander: By writing and teaching.
Alexander: It's amazing, isn't it?
I can't tell you how many older people have said to me, "I never thought I'd live to see this day."
...
Alexander: I do believe that it can.
Also the felicity of art ... the way in which it makes you draw a breath and look at the world in a different way is very useful to the process of thinking through new solutions.
So those are the challenges of writing something that makes sense at this moment on this particular day.
Alexander: I think what I was trying to say is that at the end of the day, demographics doesn't really tell you about how your work is going to be received.
That's been a real gift to me; it's made me try not to assume too much about who thinks what and who is able to gain something from work.
Alexander: Jazz is the music that I know deepest and love the most, and I mean jazz across the board because that's an incredibly diverse art, and also I must say, R&B, funk and soul speak very powerfully to me.
Alexander: Can you imagine?
