The decision came during a two-day IOC Executive Board meeting in Berlin, at which board members also decided to propose golf and rugby for inclusion in the 2016 Olympic Games.
Boxing was the sole (Olympic) sport with no women involved.
Rogge pointed out that women's boxing has around 200 athletes who could potentially compete in 2012, while softball has only around 120.
Softball and baseball were considered for inclusion in the 2016 Games along with squash, karate, roller sports, golf and rugby, but the board decided to consider only the last two.
"They have global appeal, a geographically diverse line-up of top iconic athletes and an ethic that stresses fair play."
