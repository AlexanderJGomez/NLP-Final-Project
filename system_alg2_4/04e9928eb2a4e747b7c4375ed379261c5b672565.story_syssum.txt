Brisbane, Australia (CNN) -- Emergency services and Australian military personnel stepped up the search Friday for dozens of people still missing in Queensland as authorities and residents tried to assess the damage caused by the state's worst flooding in decades.
More than 20,000 homes were inundated after the normally subdued Brisbane River turned into a raging torrent as weeks of rain pushed it to more than 4 meters at high tide early Thursday.
Residents in Brisbane were being urged not to enter floodwater because of the risk of illness after sewage plants along the river were inundated.
The Brisbane River, which slices through the city, peaked Thursday at 4.6 meters (more than 15 feet), about a meter below predictions and below the level set by the last major flood in 1974.
Bligh said 11,900 homes in Brisbane were fully flooded and 14,700 were partially flooded.
Queensland police have arrested 10 people on 18 charges of looting, Atkinson said.
Some 600 members of the Australian Defence Force were helping and more were expected, said Bligh.
Soon after Christmas, water from torrential rains swamped the northern city of Rockhampton, 600 kilometers (370 miles) north of Brisbane, triggering a massive recovery operation to rebuild the town.
One man was seen walking in the murky water up to his chin.
By late Thursday, the brown, murky water had risen more than half a meter above the second floor.
They were among more than 1,000 people who slept Wednesday night on inflatable mattresses at the center.
Numbers are expected to fall in coming days as people find alternative accommodations.
Elsewhere in the city, floodwater rose to rooftops, submerging houses and creating a logistical and financial headache for homeowners waiting for the water to drop so they could check the damage.
