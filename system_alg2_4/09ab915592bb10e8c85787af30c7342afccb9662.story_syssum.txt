Throughout my childhood, I never thought I was anything other than "female" because that's what I was labeled and raised as.
While I felt more aggressive than other girls, I didn't think that anything other than male and female could exist.
Thus, no one ever told me there was anything wrong with my body (that didn't happen until a gynecological visit when I was twenty), and I grew up loving it just the way it is.
I still do.
Still, I had no name for my difference.
I didn't think being intersex was a bad thing to be.
When asked why he supported "corrective surgeries" he answered, "Society can't accept people of different colors, and now we're supposed to accept somebody with genitalia that don't match what their gender is?
Intersex folks are not some new invention that people need to be "ready for:" we exist and always have.
I look forward to one day telling my god-daughter about how it used to be for us, and to hearing her say, "Wow, I can't believe some people had problems accepting intersex.
Humans can be so weird."
