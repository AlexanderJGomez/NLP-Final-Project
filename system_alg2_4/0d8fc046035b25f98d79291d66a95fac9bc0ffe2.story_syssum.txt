(CNN)Iraqi forces battling to wrest Tikrit from ISIS are now in control of the city, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said Tuesday on Iraqiya TV.
Tikrit had been under ISIS control since June.
The airstrikes made it possible for the Iraqi forces to move through the city.
Iraqi forces have tried multiple times to win back Tikrit since ISIS conquered the city as part of its campaign to amass an expansive Islamic caliphate but failed until now.
The Iraqi forces were aided by a coalition made up of mostly Shiite militiamen and volunteers.
The victory in Tikrit sets the stage for Iraqi forces to take back an even bigger prize: Mosul.
