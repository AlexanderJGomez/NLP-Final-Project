Guillem Valle, camera in tow, drifts to the sea floor to capture an intimate portrait of a Badjao man.
As highly skilled divers, the Badjao are able to walk along the seafloor hunting for fish and pearls.
"The project is a question," Valle said.
Despite the pull toward a more modern way of living, there are still Badjao who choose life at sea.
Valle wanted his photographs to reflect the essence of their statelessness, to create a sort of "imaginary stateless nation."
"I wanted to show who they are," he said.
This project was the first time Valle photographed underwater.
"The sea must be calm and the water must be clean," he said.
Around the third day, Valle began to gain the trust of the Badjao and they, in turn, began to understand the type of image Valle wanted.
The soft light and the way the Badjao pose in the water reflect the "imaginary stateless nation" Valle wanted to convey, causing the viewer to examine the relationship between place and identity.
