McLaughlin had struggled with weight his entire life.
He went out for lunch and dinner with his new American co-workers in an attempt to socialize and make friends -- sacrificing all hopes of eating healthy.
"I would eat and drink a lot, which played havoc with the weight."
It was tough to stop going out to eat for lunch and dinner, McLaughlin says.
Between the two of them, McLaughlin says they would split three bottles of wine with dinner.
Now he follows the Slimming World plan and prepares his meals at home.
"Now I tend to drink wine only, and I enjoy and savor the taste instead of just drinking for the sake and experience," McLaughlin says.
"And a lot of things I eat aren't that bad for him, either."
"It's hard to go to the gym after work," he says.
In the last three years, McLaughlin has lost 140 pounds.
When he first moved to New York, his only hobby was eating and drinking -- now he spends his weekends researching farmers markets to visit, chili festivals, wine stores and fruit-picking spots.
