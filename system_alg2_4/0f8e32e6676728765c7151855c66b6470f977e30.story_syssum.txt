A backlash from Democrats over add-ons to a massive government spending bill is throwing passage of the measure into doubt and once again raising concerns about a government shutdown.
The $1.1 trillion spending bill authorizes funding for virtually all agencies through September, but some Democrats on Capitol Hill are vowing to oppose the legislation, arguing that the addition of some key policy changes amount to a giveaway for big special interests.
Pelosi's position is critical because House Republicans need Democratic support for the measure to pass.
Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second ranking Democrats who is in charge of counting votes, said he didn't know if he would support the compromise or how many Democrats would.
That has been one of their passions, second only to repealing the Affordable Care Act, and it means that the Wall Street interests -- the big banks, you know -- they're back on top as far as the House Republicans are concerned," he said.
"The Congress is very concerned about taxpayer funding of political activities," Boehner said.
She said there was a joint effort with the RNC to appeal to the Federal Election Commission to raise the cap for donors for conventions, but she did not support putting this provision in the funding bill.
Democratic aides say it's still early to gauge how many members will vote no on Thursday, but acknowledge that the deal was brokered by Democrats and Republicans over several weeks.
McCarthy said about those Democrats vowing to oppose the spending measure.
Still Republicans insist that there won't be a shutdown over this issue, and indicated they would consider a short-term funding bill through early next year -- when they will have full control of Congress -- if this bill fails.
