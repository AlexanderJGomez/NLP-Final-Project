It's as relevant today as an HBO movie as when it premiered on the stage in New York City in 1985.
ACT UP, the coalition that Larry founded to address the crisis, coined the phrase "silence equals death" as its rallying cry, and it was no exaggeration.
Worldwide, another than 1.6 million people will die of AIDS this year.
And, just as in 1985, it is silence, fear and stigma that continue to drive the epidemic.
Gay and bisexual men comprise only 2% of the American population, but they represented 30% of the nation's HIV infections in 2010.
I hope HBO's production of "The Normal Heart" will compel a new generation to act up.
As Larry so forcefully taught us nearly 30 years ago -- and as he and Ryan Murphy, the director of the new HBO film, continue to remind us today -- we must speak out against injustice, act with compassion, and fight for equality.
If enough of us raise our voices, we can finally begin to end this epidemic.
