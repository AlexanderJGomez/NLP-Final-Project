Captured in waters off Washington State in 1970, Lolita is an orca -- a killer whale.
Can a killer whale be a slave?
It's a crime," Kaamil said.
Like a second lump of sugar, a whale named Hugo who had been captured from the same free-living whale community two years earlier, shared Lolita's teacup for 10 years.
Free-living orcas never do anything self-destructive.
Unlike any other known creature, unlike elephants and humans, orcas like Lolita never leave their birth family.
Free-living orcas frequently live into their 50s or beyond (they can live up to a century).
Before the captures they totaled about 120 whales.
But when the whales removed as babies would have been the next maturing generation, rebuilding hit a wall: too few females.
The whole U.S. resident population now has just two-dozen females of reproductive age.
The proposal is to move her into a vastly larger open-water net-pen in her home waters of Washington State.
There, she can be in vocal contact with her family.
Kaamil said.
