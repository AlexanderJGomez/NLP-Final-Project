(CNN) -- Qantas, Australia's national airline, grounded its Airbus A380 fleet indefinitely after one of its planes suffered a midair engine failure on Thursday.
"I am not sure what actually happened with the debris and why parts of the engine left the aircraft and fell into the ground," Joyce said.
"I do apologize," the pilot said.
We're making a left turn now to track back toward Singapore and as we progress with this we'll keep you informed, but at this stage everything is secure, the aircraft is flying safely and we'll get back to you very shortly with further information.
Pictures of the Airbus A380 after it landed showed the cowling torn off in the back half.
Passenger Meg Graham said she heard a loud bang within minutes of the plane taking off.
"We all stayed pretty calm," he told CNN.
Airbus will at some point deliver another 14, the airline said.
Lufthansa, which operates three Airbus A380s, told CNN it is planning to carry out additional precautionary checks on the engines of the planes.
