(CNN) -- Black voters allowed themselves to be used by Sen. Thad Cochran to win the Republican primary runoff for Mississippi's U.S. Senate seat.
The runoff was triggered because no candidate garnered 50% of the vote in the first primary, which Cochran lost to McDaniel by some 1,000 votes.
The tea party has become code for "racist" among many black Americans, who overwhelmingly vote Democratic.
It's true these same voters will likely vote for the Democratic nominee in the fall.
While I don't agree with how Cochran won and wish blacks were more informed about their vote, Cochran bothered to ask blacks to vote for him, something that apparently makes some Republicans cringe.
Many blacks would say the Republican Party only works in earnest for the white vote.
Come November, I doubt Cochran will really care about earning the black vote and taking the Republican message of equal opportunity and economic empowerment to blacks.
Cochran demonstrates what many black conservatives already know: GOP candidates will only reach out to black voters, kicking and screaming, as a last resort to win.
This isn't the path to future Republican victories in truly competitive national races in a country where census data show the white population declining while minorities are growing.
