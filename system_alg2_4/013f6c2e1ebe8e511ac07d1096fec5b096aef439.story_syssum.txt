I've consistently faced "random" selections for extra screening at the airport after I decided to wear the hijab, or Muslim head covering.
One time, the woman in front of me had a hairdo that could pose more of a security threat than any head scarf could.
The TSA uses the hijab to profile Muslim women, and passengers can now expect a full-body pat-down, an appallingly invasive "enhanced pat-down search  that could include the chest and groin, or a planned "mind-scan"  that would track people's reaction to terrorist symbols.
Do they seriously have a blank check on our bodies?
Radio host Mike Gallagher said, "There should be a separate line to scrutinize anybody with the name Abdul or Ahmed or Mohammed."
For people who aren't affected by racial profiling at airports, imagine this: The TSA implements a new rule to counter drunken driving, which kills over 13,000 Americans every year.
Thirty-two million Americans report that they have been the victims of racial profiling.
You also run into problems when you justify profiling nearly one in every four people in the world.
There are some people who don't know Muslims and are numb to realizing the effects of profiling.
According to the Pew Research Center, people who know Muslims are less likely to have negative views of them.
There are some Americans who think Muslims are terrorists and some Muslims who think that other Americans are willfully ignorant.
Religious profiling boxes Muslims into a category separate from Americans.
