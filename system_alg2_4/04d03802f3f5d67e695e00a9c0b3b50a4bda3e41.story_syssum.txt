(CNN) -- The Department of Energy is putting federal money behind the development of small-scale nuclear reactors that supporters say are cheaper, safer and easier to build, though the design still needs federal approval.
The total amount of the award has yet to be calculated, but the government will pay up to half the project cost and will work with the companies to get the new reactors licensed and operating within 10 years, the Energy Department said.
"You don't have to build a 1,000- or 1,500-megawatt power plant and hope that demand catches up," said Genoa, the NEI's senior director of policy development.
The industry and the Energy Department say that would make SMRs a good choice for small utilities.
"What Fukushima has shown us is that existing nuclear power plants don't have the personnel or resources to cope with severe emergencies," said Lyman, a physicist and senior scientist with the watchdog group.
"The SMRs are without a doubt going to be more expensive than even large reactors," he said.
But he said the experience of other industries, such as aerospace or the U.S. nuclear submarine program, shows costs can drop significantly over the life of a program.
