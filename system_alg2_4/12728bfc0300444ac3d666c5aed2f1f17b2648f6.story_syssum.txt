The CDC had hoped that about 40 million doses of H1N1, or swine flu, vaccine would be available by the end of October.
As of Wednesday, 11.4 million doses of flu vaccine were available to be ordered and 8 million doses had been ordered by state health departments, the CDC said.
Georgia, for example, is going to get less than half of the amount of H1N1 vaccine that it was expecting to receive this month, state Public Health Commissioner Dr. Rhonda Medows said.
A little more than half of the available doses are flu shots, she said, and the other doses are the nasal flu spray, which is approved only for healthy people between the ages of 2 and 49.

Children and young adults ranging in age from 6 months to 24 years are among those health officials say should be the first to get the H1N1 vaccine.
Health care workers, pregnant women and people with underlying illness also should be among the first to get vaccine, they say.
