Kennedy Space Center, Florida (CNN) -- The space shuttle Endeavour landed at Kennedy Space Center in Florida early Wednesday, completing its 25th and final mission -- the next-to-last mission for NASA's 30-year-old space shuttle program.
It first went into service in 1993.
"The retirement of Endeavour and the shuttle fleet will not end the human need to explore," Kelly said in comments from space that were posted on NASA's website.
"Look how majestic it looks rolling out to the launch pad," said astronaut Sandy Magnus to reporters.
"Look at that and see what we can do when we put our minds to it."
