"I never really worked very goal-oriented," he admits.
An unconventional upbringing in a New Hampshire log cabin with no electricity or running water gave way to a skiing career in which, for Miller, his natural talent and love of the sport always won out over, well, winning.
He was a great athlete before his injury and was really having a hard time sort of adapting, which is a really tough process when you're injured like that," says Miller.
Shaw-Doran serves as director of equipment development for Turtle Ridge, and Miller has called on friends and associates from across the sporting world to create and adapt equipment to help adaptive skiers and adaptive athletes in other sports.
It turns into a bit of pandemonium on the way down," Miller says.
"When we build some of our ski equipment and you give it to a kid who never had the chance to go up and experience what it is to ski down a giant mountain and you watch how life-changing that can be for them, I think it's really -- it's pretty incredible."
The sentiment seems to fit with Miller's general philosophy of focusing on how the sport makes you feel, rather than the end game, a feeling he believes everyone is entitled to, regardless of ability.
