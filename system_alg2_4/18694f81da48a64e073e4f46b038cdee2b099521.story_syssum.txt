Hong Kong (CNN) -- Disgraced Chinese politician Bo Xilai has confounded expectations by delivering a cool, considered denial of charges leveled against him during a keenly-anticipated corruption trial that has captivated China.
CNN: Before Bo Xilai's trial, many commentators predicted it would follow a tight script but that doesn't appear to be the case.
Li: Bo as a person, as a leader, is unpredictable.
It will be the authorities' problem if they didn't prepare for that.
Li: Of course there would have been deals made before, otherwise the leadership would not be willing to pursue the charges.
In July, they put forward only three charges: Bribery, corruption and abuse of power.
He made a lot of people nervous about his self-promotion campaign -- that's the real reason, not about corruption.
Now the leadership is in an awkward position -- the charges of corruption will not resonate too well and they can't go back to the other charges.
Li: If you follow the reaction in China most people think that Bo did well, including people who really do not like him.
Some people who previously really hated him now tend to forget all the awful things he allegedly did.
There are a lot of rumors that he was very emotional and out of control in jail.
Bo Xilai and his defense lawyer came across very well -- that was also a surprise, in many ways.
Of course the prosecution didn't buy that, but when people judge, at least the civilian people, they buy that argument.
Li: The Bo case has revealed the fundamental flaws of the political system and the widespread phenomenon of corruption and power abuse.
The leadership wants to move forward.
But the sentencing now can't be very severe because of the nature of the charges and how poorly they've conducted this trial.
The worst is probably the life sentence, and the most lenient probably 15 years.
