Bayern were 3-0 up after an hour against ailing champions Wolfsburg as Dutch forward Arjen Robben scored in the second minute from Thomas Muller's left-wing cross and defender Daniel van Buyten headed his sixth goal this season from Ivica's Olic pass on 26.
The result gave Bayern 45 points from 21 matches after a seventh successive victory, while Wolfsburg are now 20 points off the pace and just six above the relegation zone.
Fourth-placed Hamburg remained nine points behind the leaders after also dropping two points in a 3-3 draw at Cologne.
Stuttgart continued their climb up the table with a 2-1 win at second-bottom Nuremburg that lifted them to eighth thanks to Roberto Hilbert's 87th-minute winner.
Palermo moved up to fifth place, two points above Juve, with a 2-1 victory at home to Parma.
Edison Cavani headed in Fabrizio Miccoli's free-kick to put Palermo ahead after 63 minutes, but Jonathan Biabiany leveled nine minutes later with a controversial goal which came while the hosts called for treatment for their scorer.
