"Our rocket crew is ready," continued Nkoloso, explaining that his aspiring troupe of space explorers had been gearing up for their interstellar journey in the headquarters of the academy he'd set up on the outskirts of Zambian capital Lusaka.
From within what he called the "Academy of Sciences and Space Technology," Nkoloso said, he'd been studying Mars through telescopes.
"The first one on the list was the Zambia space program," says De Middel who, after a decade of working as a news photojournalist, had decided to embark on a new career as a visual storyteller.
In the self-published book, De Middel self-consciously conjures up the story of the unofficial space program piece by piece.
"I was working in a very free way," says De Middel, sitting at the caf√© of the Photographer's Gallery in London, where The Afronauts is being exhibited.
"You don't have to be American and work for NASA to dream of going to the moon; you can be an African -- he [Nkoloso] was a school teacher and thought that could be done."
Creating The Afronauts, which was sold out in just a few months, De Middel worked more as a movie director, trying to make the best of the resources around her.
De Middel, who's never been to Zambia, acknowledges she's not "an expert in Africa" -- nor in space.
"I always kept in my mind that I don't know a lot about African history and I am approaching a subject that can be sensitive or can be offensive for some people," says De Middel.
If anything, De Middel says, the extraordinary tale of the forgotten Zambian space program presented a chance to talk about Africa from a different perspective.
"He had a fascination for the universe that we all share," says De Middel.
