(CNN) -- Aviation isn't known as the most eco-friendly industry.
After a large-scale redesign of many of its 737 aircraft, the carrier found itself with an excess of 80,000 leather seat covers -- enough to fill the Empire State Building.
Southwest dubbed the initiative "Luv Seat: Repurpose with Purpose," and reached out to potential partners to take the used leather, but found that there were few takers.
Rather than just donating the goods and leaving it there, the airline decided to take a more holistic approach, giving the materials to NGOs that will use them to provide job training and health education.
The leather is finite, but the skills these young people will learn will hopefully take them through their lives," says McInnis.
Scott Hamlin, the founder of upcycling company Looptworks and Southwest's only U.S. partner, says the reason companies are resistant to using second-hand materials is that there's no financial imperative.
According to Hamlin, who will create special-edition bags from the leather, each bag uses 4,000 gallons less water than if created using virgin leather.
"The circular economy starts to work when the value of the carbon emissions and water starts coming into play, like in the UK, where they will soon start having tax benefits for low-carbon companies," he says.
It's a trend that's only likely to grow.
"This is a new area for us, and with the leather, we're just dipping our toe in the water," explains McInnis.
