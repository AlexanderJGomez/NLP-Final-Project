(CNN) -- It's a cliche.
He was an ex-con, who spent years in solitary confinement because he was deemed too great a risk to the prison community.
"From the beginning, his son just seemed to have this bad streak, a streak of cruelty, and anger," Colorado Gov.
Ebel grew up on a quiet street in Lakewood, Colorado, near Denver.
He was the son of Jody Mangue and Jack Ebel, an attorney and former oil executive.
As a teenager, Ebel was sent to a boot-camp-type program in Samoa, where according to one person who knew him there, almost everyone avoided him.
Authorities have said the bullets that killed Clements came from a gun that was found with Ebel, who had handwritten directions to the prison chief's house in his car.
No clear motive has emerged in either case.
According to Mangue, Ebel's life took a sharp turn after his sister's death.
Mangue and Ebel's father kept in close contact, sending letters, cards and visiting their son when they could.
Mangue wrote about the bright moments of her son's childhood.
The family kept her for 15 years.
Ebel was released from prison in January, after serving seven years -- three for felony menacing, robbery and assault, another four for assaulting a guard.
That time was hard for Ebel, Frey said, and it may have made things worse.
He never liked being told what to do and his time in isolation really only compacted that," Frey said.
