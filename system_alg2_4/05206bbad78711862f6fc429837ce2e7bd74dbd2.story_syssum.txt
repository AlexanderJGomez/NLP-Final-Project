Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- The central business district of Bangkok dodged severe flooding Saturday afternoon, but surrounding areas of the bustling capital faced further inundation at the next high tide.
Massive runoff was flowing south to the sea through Bangkok, as high tides pushed the water in the opposite direction.
Health concerns were rising with the water.
As floodwater entered homes, some Bangkok residents still in the city made plans to leave.
The Bangkok Post reported that government buses had evacuated a number of elderly residents from the northern and eastern suburbs, and would pick up residents of the capital on Saturday and take them out of Bangkok.
Another Bangkok resident said she was worried about abandoning her house, which has been flooded for five days, and would not leave.
Thailand's Ministry of Public Health had transferred 280 of the capital's 520 patients in severe condition to 22 hospitals upcountry, the MCOT news agency reported.
