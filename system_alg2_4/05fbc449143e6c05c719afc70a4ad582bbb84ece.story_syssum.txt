Apologies are all well and good, but this one brings to mind two trite but true sayings: "Too little, too late" and "Actions speak louder than words."
But Francis is not the first pope to meet with sex abuse victims or even the first to offer an official apology for what has to be one of the gravest evils in the church.
In March, editors of the National Catholic Reporter, which has been covering sex abuse by clergy for nearly three decades, implored the Pope in an open letter to make meeting with victims a priority.
Of course, a good apology includes not only acknowledgment of personal and/or corporate responsibility for the victim's pain, but also a promise to fix things, or at least to not continue to inflict that pain.
"The Pope says the church should 'make reparations' to victims.
That's secondary.
If that's true, it will be the victims who will be the real saints, not the apologizers.
