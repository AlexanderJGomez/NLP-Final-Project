Havens told Billboard that his breakthrough at Woodstock came after another artist's equipment got stuck in traffic.
"It was 5 o'clock and nothing was happening yet," Havens told Billboard.
Havens, a Brooklyn, New York, native, told CNN in 1999 that music enabled him to leave his rough neighborhood to head to Greenwich Village and the music scene there.
"I came up in Brooklyn singing doo-wop music from the time I was 13 to the time I was 20.
"It was the songs that actually changed my life," he says.
They were just so powerful.
Stephen Stills of Crosby, Stills and Nash said Havens was an inspiration for the natural gravel in his singing voice.
He added that he thought Havens' style was probably a little too arcane to appeal to a mass audience.
"But he sure knew what to do when they were begging for someone to go on first, when all those people showed up at Woodstock," Stills said.
