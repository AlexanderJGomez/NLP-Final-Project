MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Criminal charges were filed against the co-owner of a Florida clinic where a teenager claims she sought an abortion, but instead gave birth to a baby that the woman allegedly threw in the trash.
Authorities were unable to file more serious charges against Gonzalez because they could not prove the baby's exact cause of death.
The baby's mother, Sycloria Williams, sued the clinic, its staffers and Pierre Jean-Jacques Renelique, its doctor, last month.
She was 18 at the time.
In the affidavit, police said they found out about the incident when they received a tip the following day.
Six days after the first search, police received another tip that the infant's remains were placed back inside the clinic.
However, according to the police affidavit, the medical examiner could not definitively say that the baby had been born alive.
In December 2007, Gonzalez was convicted of unlicensed practice of medicine for actions between August and December of 2004, and is serving five years' probation, according to the affidavit.
However, because the 2006 incident preceded her probation term, she is not accused of violating her probation.
