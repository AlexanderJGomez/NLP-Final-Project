Now, the question is how President Barack Obama will respond.
Obama will be presented with final options regarding actions against Syria in the next few days, a senior administration official said Monday.
The administration also wants it to be a quick response to the use of chemical weapons, the senior administration official said.
A U.S. strike "can't just be one and done," but should be part of a plan to remove al-Assad, he told CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360."
"And yet, here we are again.
The result could be "a Vietnam-type problem, where we kind of back our way into this, if we don't come up with a plan about how to win."
The Obama administration is expected to declassify the intelligence assessment backing up its assertion that the Syrian regime was responsible for last week's chemical weapons attack, another senior administration official said.
The official insisted that all other options were under consideration by Obama but put no time frame on a decision.
A senior administration official told CNN on Monday that the goals of any coalition military action would be to punish al-Assad and show him that there was a cost for using chemical weapons while preventing him from doing so again.
Last month, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey provided Congress with a list of declassified U.S. military options for Syria that emphasized the high costs and risks of what he said would amount to "an act of war" at a time of deep budget cuts.
There is no indication that the missiles would strike at actual chemical weapons stockpiles.
"It's almost inevitable that the president will authorize some form of military action," Miller told National Public Radio in an interview broadcast Monday.
"It cannot simply be a couple of cruise missiles into a storage shed somewhere," Miller said, adding that the goal was to deter al-Assad rather than topple him or radically shift the balance in Syria at this time.
