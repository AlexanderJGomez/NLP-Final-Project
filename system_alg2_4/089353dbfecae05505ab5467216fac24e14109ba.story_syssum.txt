If we could see off camera, we might see Bieber's attorney subtly shaking his head in frustration.
Counsel would know what Justin may not want to "beliebe": You only hurt yourself at a deposition when you bicker with the questioning attorney.
What is a deposition?
But a deposition is not a trial.
An argumentative witness like Bieber is a dream come true for his opponent.
Watch, for example, when he answers: "Guess what?
You can't answer if you don't know the question:  Bieber can be seen interrupting questions to answer.
And, if a question hasn't even been finished yet, a witness can't possibly limit the answer to the question asked -- he doesn't know what the question is yet!
Wait until the question is complete; pause and ask yourself if you understand the question; if you do, ask yourself if you know the answer to the question; if you do, only answer the question asked.
Bieber."
At a deposition, the lawyer asks the questions, not the witness.
At a deposition, "relevant" subject matter is any question "reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence."
Bieber may not like the questions, but he takes his chances with the judge if he refuses to answer.
Bieber's opponent benefits from each additional word Bieber says, because that's part of another sentence the singer needs to testify consistently with at trial.
A: Oh yeah, sure.
For the most part, you're on your own: Bieber's lawyer actively objected to protect his client, but deponents often feel like their lawyers aren't getting involved enough.
He can object "for the record," which means the judge can later decide if the answer is ultimately admissible at trial.
Bieber appears on the video to really think about the meaning of the questions and his answers.
If he could carve out his other behavior, in some respects, he's not half-bad as a deponent.
