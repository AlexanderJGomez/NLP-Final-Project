By the way, this "cheap" food is also contributing to the most costly epidemic of diabetes and obesity in human history.
They can open when they choose, serve what they like and hire whom they want.
Education reform movements are often based on the fast-food model of quality assurance: on standardization and conformity.
Human aspirations reach much higher and if the conditions are right they succeed.
