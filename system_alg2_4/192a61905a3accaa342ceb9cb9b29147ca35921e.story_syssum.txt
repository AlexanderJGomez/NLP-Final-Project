Intuit, which also makes TurboTax, maintains the two personal-finance tools in tandem, and recent updates to each, such as the free Mint iPad app that launched on Wednesday or the major new version of Quicken that hit stores last month, are indicative of how different their audiences think about their money.
Quicken comes in many flavors and can cost anywhere from $30 to $150, with one advertisement for a Quicken credit card shown infrequently.
Mint seems to push out updates to its website and mobile apps constantly, but the iPad version was a long-awaited release for many people who use the service regularly.
At least three versions of Quicken 2012 appear in the top 50 for software sold on Amazon.com, but an Intuit spokeswoman declined to provide sales data.
About a third of Quicken customers buy a new version every year, and another third upgrade every three years, said Eddy Wu, an Intuit senior product manager.
"Most people don't like to do all that manual data entry," Wu said.
If people choose not to use these features, they can bask in the safety of keeping everything on their own machines.
When it struggled to make inroads and then failed in its $1.5 billion bid to acquire Intuit in 1994 due to federal antitrust concerns, Microsoft retreated.
