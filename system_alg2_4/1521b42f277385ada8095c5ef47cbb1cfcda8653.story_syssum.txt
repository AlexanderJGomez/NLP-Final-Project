(CNN) -- The little-known South African Louis Oosthuizen shocked the world of golf as he stormed to his first ever major win on Sunday with a runaway seven-shot victory at the British Open at St. Andrews.
Oosthuizen, who also has a home in Manchester, England, was born in Mossel Bay, South Africa.
"It was unbelievable what he (Ernie Els) did for me," Oosthuizen told the official British Open website.
But despite hitting a 57 during a practice round on the par-72 Mossel Bay Golf Club course, along with gaining his European Tour card in 2003, his early performances in the paid ranks were less impressive.
The South African responded to the early setback by making 2007 his best year so far on the golf circuit, winning three titles on the Sunshine Tour including the Telkcom PGA championship.
A victory of sorts in America was next, as the South African won the Par 3 Contest at the 2010 Masters in April, but he missed the cut in the tournament proper at Augusta.
Having missed the cut at the British Open in 2004, 2006 and 2009, few, if any, envisaged him collecting the trophy at the end of play on Sunday.
