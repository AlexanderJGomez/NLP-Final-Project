His body was "set afire," according to his family, who said they twice met with a coroner.
"Beating is not the cause of death," said Meredith, who confirmed he'd met twice with McMillian's family.
They said McMillian had told "family and close friends that he was very concerned for his personal safety."
McMillian's Facebook page shows a glimpse at a man who was politically ambitious.
His campaign motto: "Moving Clarksdale forward."
He received the Thurgood Marshall Prestige Award from the Thurgood Marshall College Fund five years later.
