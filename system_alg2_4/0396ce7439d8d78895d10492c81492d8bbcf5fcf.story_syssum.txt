(CNN) -- At least 150 people drowned when a boat leaving Libya capsized off the Tunisian coast this week, the U.N. refugee agency said Friday.
The passengers were mostly migrants from West Africa, Pakistan and Bangladesh who were fleeing fighting in Libya, the refugee agency said in a statement.
"Desperate passengers rushed to one side, seeking rescue by the Tunisian coast guard and fishing boats that had approached the vessel," and the boat capsized, the agency said.
More than 30,000 migrants and refugees from Tunisia and Libya have risked the dangerous journey to Lampedusa.
"Just last month, hundreds died as a vessel carrying about 600 people broke up shortly after departing Tripoli."
