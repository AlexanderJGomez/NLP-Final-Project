Police said that a man broke into the Mosman, Australia, home of the woman, later identified as Madeleine Pulver, on August 3 and attached what she then believed to be a bomb.
"The information that I have is that the suspect was surprised" to be arrested, said Assistant Commissioner David Hudson.
But Hudson said that he is an Australian citizen who frequently traveled to the United States on business.
The suspect is expected to be arraigned Tuesday morning in a U.S. court, said Hudson.
The alleged crime occurred in Mosman, a wealthy suburb about eight kilometers (five miles) from Sydney where many well-connected people, sports stars and celebrities live, resident and Australian news reporter Dave Kirwan told CNN.
"You've seen that today."
