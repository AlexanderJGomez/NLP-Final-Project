Last year, I was covering the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington when I came across a stall selling old political pins.
To them, he was the archetypal Republican in Name Only -- a liberal in conservative clothing.
That's partly a reflection of political reality; they lost the presidential election and only control the House.
Of course, principle is an admirable quality.
In domestic policy, Nixon bowed to the liberal consensus of his era.
The Philadelphia Plan was opposed by many Democrats, not just by Southern conservatives but also by labor leaders who saw it as a challenge to seniority programs.
But Nixon won re-election in 1972 partly on a reputation as a peacemaker with whom the Democrats could not compete.
When that war was concluded, Nixon was widely regarded as having saved the world from a superpower confrontation in the Middle East and he was greeted by enthusiastic crowds in Egypt.
Had Watergate not reduced his political capital so early in 1973, there's a chance Nixon would have pushed ahead with his agenda of a New Federalism and undone much of the liberalism of his first term.
Aside from Watergate, that's why he's so unpopular with the contemporary conservative movement.
As president, his ambition to build a permanent New Majority depended upon walking a line between the radicalism of the left and the racialism of the far right.
Today, it's difficult to talk about Nixon as a model for contemporary Republicans because his political reputation is so tarnished.
Considering that record, moderate Republicans in pursuit of the White House have every cause to get misty-eyed when they hear the name Richard Nixon.
