(CNN) -- Michael Jackson was the pride of Gary, Indiana, growing up, and on Friday, his hometown paid tribute to the late entertainer with a memorial and celebration in his honor.
Gary Mayor Rudy Clay noted Jackson put the city on the world's map and bid farewell to the star.
"Gary, you will always have a special place in my heart," Jackson said in the video played on the stadium's jumbo screen.
After being surrounded by TV crews and photographers, Joe Jackson made his way to the stage, thanked everyone for attending and said it was good to be home.
"This is a pleasure to be back to see so many people here," Joe Jackson said.
