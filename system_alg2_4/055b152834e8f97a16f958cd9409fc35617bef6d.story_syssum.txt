WASHINGTON (CNN) -- There's not much to cheer inside the once venerable Secret Service lately, but veterans are thrilled that at this moment of crisis that "Father Joe" agreed to take the helm.
One likely knock on Clancy that has been mentioned since his temporary appointment is that he was in charge of PPD at the time of the infamous Salahi gate crashing incident in 2009.
There was some talk of Clancy coming back when Sullivan left and before Julia Pierson was appointed, for either the number one or number two job, but he preferred to stay in the private sector at the time.
Secret Service insiders think that it would be a mistake to bring in an outsider.
They were worried the outsider thing would be immediate.
