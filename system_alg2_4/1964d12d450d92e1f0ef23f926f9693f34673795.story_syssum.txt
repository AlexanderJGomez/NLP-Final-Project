Aberdeen, Maryland (CNN) -- The man who abducted the mother of Baltimore Orioles legend Cal Ripken Jr. from her Maryland home restrained her and appeared to have used her credit cards, a law enforcement official said Wednesday.
Aberdeen police said that they have no knowledge of a ransom being demanded or paid, and that Cal Ripken apparently wasn't contacted.
He also said police don't know of any relationship between the suspect and the Ripken family.
Police are looking for a white male with a light, thin build in his late 30s to early 40s last seen wearing a light-colored shirt, glasses and "camo pants."
"This has been a very trying time for our family, but we are grateful and relieved that mom is back with us, safe and healthy," the statement said.
He died in 1999.
