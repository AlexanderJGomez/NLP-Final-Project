"Twilight" stars Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart won for best kiss, an honor they received for the previous installment as well.
"Thanks, you guys, for giving us best kiss again," Stewart said.
"Bridesmaid" star Melissa McCarthy won for best comedic performance.
"Right now, I have no idea what's going on," Woodley said backstage.
