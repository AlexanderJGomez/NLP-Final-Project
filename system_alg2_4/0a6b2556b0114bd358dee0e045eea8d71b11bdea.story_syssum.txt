"I'm just happy to be alive," said passenger Jarrod West, who slid down holding his black Chihuahua.
A loud pop initiated the brush with disaster, said West and other passengers who spoke with KCAL from the airport in Long Beach, California.
Actor Jackson Rathbone was on the flight with his wife and child.
It grew so thick that passengers could no longer see the people seated next to them, said passenger Jonathon Hubbard.
Fortunately, not far from its departure airport, the plane made a sharp turn back toward it, Rathbone said.
"I thought this was it."
Then flight attendants prepared the passengers in the event of a hard landing.
He did good," West said.
"I took the exit door and just threw it out the plane and just jumped out," he told KCAL.
Passengers were led to a room, where they were debriefed, Rathbone said.
There was no statement on the Flight 1416 incident on JetBlue's website.
Rathbone and his family went home to celebrate their living through Thursday's scare with a wine and champagne tasting, he said on whosay -- they opened a half-dozen bottles.
