(CNN) -- Eleven people died as Hurricane Sandy pummeled Cuba on Thursday, state media reported.
We have never had a storm hit like this," said a woman named Dulce, a doctor in the city of Santiago.
Residents in Santiago spent Thursday assessing the extent of the damage.
Bahamians and their guests hunkered down Thursday night as Sandy, a Category 2 hurricane, tore through the islands with 100 mph wind and the potential for up to 12 inches of rain.
It is a "small storm" with "mediocre wind," he said.
As of 8 p.m.
ET, the eye of the storm was 105 miles (170 kilometers) east of Nassau, sparing the Bahamas' largest city the worst part of the storm.
"This could be like the 'Perfect Storm' 21 years ago," he said of the potential damage.
Even hundreds of miles away, the storm kicked up powerful surf off Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
"I went in the water, I did about three somersaults ... strong rip current," he told CNN affiliate WSVN.
On Friday, more high waves and rip currents are likely along the coastal beaches of Florida's east coast and into southern Georgia, as well as tropical storm force wind gusts up to 50 mph.
The five-day forecast from the National Hurricane Center predicts the center of the storm will shadow the East Coast in the coming days, with Sandy potentially making landfall as a tropical storm in New Jersey the day before Halloween.
In the Dominican Republic, Misael Rincon, a CNN iReporter, couldn't sleep as Sandy's rain beat down on Santo Domingo because he knew his neighborhood is prone to flooding.
Some cars were submerged, and people with trucks were charging motorists $5 to pull their vehicles to higher ground, he said.
