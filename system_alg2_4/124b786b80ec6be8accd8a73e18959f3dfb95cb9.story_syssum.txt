But how many years are lost?
Non-smoking adults who were extremely obese -- defined as having a BMI of 55 to 55.9 -- lost nearly 14 years on average.
Researchers analyzed 20 large studies, which included more than 9,500 extremely obese adults and more than 300,000 people with a normal BMI.
And a simple blood test could be the key, according new study published Thursday in Alzheimer's & Dementia, a journal of the Alzheimer's Association.
Researchers used blood samples from 1,148 people.
People in need of a kidney often wait years for a deceased donor match.

The Academy is also calling for a national registry the will require mandatory reporting of concussions.
