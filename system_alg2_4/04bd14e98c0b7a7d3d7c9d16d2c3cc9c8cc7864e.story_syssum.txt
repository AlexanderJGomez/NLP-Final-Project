Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actor Charlie Sheen on Friday declared "we are at war" following canceled production of the hit CBS sitcom "Two and a Half Men" and his impending loss of $1.2 million per episode.
"They kept telling me how to live my personal life," said Sheen, making repeated references to money he brought to the network.
"I was told if I went on the attack, they would cancel the show and all that, so I'm just sort of seeing if they're telling the truth or not," Sheen told Jones.
It's not clear if "Two and Half Men" will return for a ninth season.
A Warner Brothers spokesman said that at least 250 members of the cast and crew will be out of work during the canceled production.
"This bootleg cult, arrogantly referred to as Alcoholics Anonymous, reports a 5% success rate.
Bulls**t!
The actor also went after show co-creator Chuck Lorre.
"
Sheen's father, actor Martin Sheen, told Sky News earlier this week he likened Sheen's addiction to having cancer.
That's what we do for him."
"I healed really quickly, but I also unravel really quickly, so get me right now guys," Sheen said.
Sheen was "very, very intoxicated, also apparently in a lot of pain" on the morning of January 27, according to a 911 call from a doctor who had just talked to the actor.
CNN's Alan Duke, Aaron Smith and Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report.
