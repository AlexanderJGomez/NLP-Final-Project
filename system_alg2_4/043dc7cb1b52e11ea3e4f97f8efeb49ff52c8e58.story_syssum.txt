His comments inspired Twitter users to tweet the hashtag #YesAllWomen: They shared examples of what "women must fear" even if "not all men" engage in those behaviors, according to the person believed to have created the hashtag Saturday.
#YesAllWomen is the latest Twitter hashtag to draw attention to violence against women in a global conversation that has spread from social media to college campuses and into the White House.
More unique is the conversation's focus on misogyny and its negative impact on women and men, Maxwell said, pointing to tweets from men as evidence.
#YesAllWomen's forebears include #everydaysexism, which evolved from the website Everyday Sexism.
It has been tweeted more than 520,000 times in the past year, according to social Web search engine Topsy.
It has drawn comments from celebrities such as Kerry Washington, Neil Gaiman and Patton Oswalt.
In fact, Rodger's killing spree shows that men can also be victims of hostility toward women: Four men were among those killed, including his two roommates, "the biggest nerds I had ever seen," Rodger said.
Sklar said his words echoed sentiments voiced by men's rights activists in online forums and social media platforms, especially Twitter.
It's an extreme case of something we see and experience regularly as part of our lives, but it's shocking and jarring and scary to see it taken to these lengths," said Sklar, who founded the women's network TheLi.st.
The hashtag also forced discussion of the intersection of mental illness and misogyny in violence against women, especially in mass shootings, which are overwhelmingly perpetrated by white men.
It created a virtual space for women to share their stories, Chemaly said.
