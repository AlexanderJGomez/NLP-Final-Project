Editor's note: Below is an excerpt from Nancy Grace's new novel "The Eleventh Victim."
What was it?
He couldn't just leave the body lying there like that.
He looked at her lying there in the moonlight.
She got straight into his car with a big smile when he offered her a ride.
It was the only thing about her he could stomach.
The shiny pink lip gloss she was wearing had thickened in spots across her lips and some had smeared onto her front teeth.
What was it?
Like a delicate souffl√© or performing his specialty, decorating with boiling-hot spun sugar, perfection was achieved only by acute attention to detail.
It was his favorite brand --it was actually the only twine he would ever consider using -- just shipped in from France.
The wrist?
No.
No.
Sometime during their "date," fresh, damp dirt and a little grass had smeared horizontally across her mouth and worked its way up into her nose.
As he stood there at the foot of her body, staring into her face, her own eyes stared away from him and straight up into the sky, her lips still slightly parted just as they had been in life...just as they had been at the zenith, that incredibly beautiful and intimate moment when she exhaled her last breath into the night.
He squatted down and gently picked up her left hand.
He placed the hand back gently across her stomach.
