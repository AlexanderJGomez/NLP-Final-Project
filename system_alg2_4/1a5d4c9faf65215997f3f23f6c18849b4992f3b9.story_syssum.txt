Cairo (CNN) -- The man who held Egypt in an autocratic grip for three decades is apparently soon going free.
"It may not play as big there as it does here," she said.
He was convicted last year on charges of inciting violence against protesters during the popular uprising the led to his ouster and, eventually, the elections that brought Morsy to power.
Egypt's general prosecutor has said he will not appeal to keep Mubarak in custody, state media reported, clearing the way for him to be released.
Mubarak ruled Egypt, the most populous Arab country, for three decades until demonstrators opposing his rule forced his ouster in 2011 as part of the Arab Spring revolutions across Africa and the Middle East.
Despite the release, there's no possibility of his return to power, Wright said.
"For many Egyptians, Mubarak's release will be met with a shrug.
As for the timing of the court's ruling, some Egyptians may see a conspiracy behind it in which the old regime seeks to reassert power following Morsy's ouster, Trager said.
The group called for a retrial of the former president, with new evidence before the court, and for Morsy to be put on trial as well.
