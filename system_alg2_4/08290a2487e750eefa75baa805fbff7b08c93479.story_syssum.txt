(CNN) -- A copyright dispute over royalties from an acclaimed film, "Raging Bull," can go the distance after the Supreme Court on Monday allowed a lawsuit to move ahead.
The case on the merits will now be heard in lower federal courts.
She claimed ownership over the original screenplay and the subsequent rights to the story.
Federal copyright law gave Paula Petrella the sole right to renew the copyrights before the term expired, which she did in 1991.
Paula Petrella claims she is the sole owner of the book and the original screenplay, and that the subsequent film infringes on those copyrights.
The companies say having an open-ended period to file copyright claims makes it hard to make future business decisions.
"If the rule were, as MGM urges, 'sue soon, or forever hold your peace,' copyright owners would have to mount a federal case fast to stop seemingly innocuous infringements, lest those infringements eventually grow in magnitude," she said.
Copyright experts say the high court's ruling will make it easier to press decades-old copyright claims.
The case is Petrella v. MGM, Inc. (12-1315).
