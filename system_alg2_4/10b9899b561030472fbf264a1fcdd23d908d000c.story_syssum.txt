An increasing number of people are pooling their resources to buy up and then share grandiose luxury products like yachts and private jets through fractional ownership initiatives.
"It's great to bring clients and business contacts on the boat because the boat is a place more small ... more intimate," yacht owner Dino Ballestra told CNN.
"We're helping the industry to become more efficient by allowing owners to charter their aircraft through the victor platform and allowing people who want to charter a jet -- not own a jet -- and take all the benefits of flying private to and from destinations," explained Flyvictor founder, Clive Jackson.
Customers are never guaranteed to get exactly what they are after but if they're lucky they may be able to pick up a bargain.
"It's the high cost ... that drives people out of yachting," he said.
You spend more time managing the boat than your business," he added.
People don't want to be tied down to an asset they use infrequently.
