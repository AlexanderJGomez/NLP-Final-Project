Jackson, Mississippi (CNN) -- LaShawn Traylor was rushed to the hospital as Hurricane Katrina was carving its way through South Florida on August 25, 2005.
But LaShawn Traylor slipped into a medically induced coma and was put on a ventilator inside Methodist Hospital in east New Orleans, Louisiana, not far from the city's Lower 9th Ward.
I thought we'd be back in a few days," Lionel Traylor said.
"I couldn't imagine how serious it was."
The bottom floors of Methodist Hospital filled with water.
Doctors and nurses were using their hands to keep the ventilator pumps going and patients alive.
"I thought I was going to die," Traylor said.
She'd been told that Lorenzo was taken to Children's Hospital.
"I thought Lorenzo was dead already," Traylor said.
LaShawn Traylor says, "a nurse told me she didn't think I was going to make it."
Traylor was in a line of female patients evacuated from the Methodist Hospital maternity ward.
But moments later we broadcast her story, and Traylor and the picture of her baby boy were loaded onto a plane bound for Texas.
"I thought Lorenzo was with her and when I first saw her she told me 'I don't know where the baby is' and that's when my heart sank," said Lionel Traylor.
In a September 14, 2005, posting on the website of U.S. Rep. Michael Burgess of Fort Worth, the congressman's staff detailed the efforts to track down Lorenzo.
The family tried to return to New Orleans, the city both LaShawn and Lionel Traylor had always called home.
"Going back to a city that needed to be rebuilt was just too much for the kids, leaving New Orleans was really hard," said LaShawn Traylor.
"Life is better now," says LaShawn Traylor.
"What Katrina did for me was a wake-up call; it made me start to live my life in a better way.
