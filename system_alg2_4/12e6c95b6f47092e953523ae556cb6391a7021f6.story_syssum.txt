Dr. Mitra Roses of the Pan American Health Organization said some hospitals were performing between 30 and 100 amputations a day after the earthquake.
She had just discovered that a 2-year-old girl cannot feel her left foot and may need an amputation.
"What I fear is that if I can't walk, I can't go to school and I can't go to church," said a boy who lost his foot in the earthquake.
Amputees may have trouble getting to work, she said, and the problem is compounded if those people perform manual labor, which requires greater use of their limbs.
Like the boy who lost his foot, they may not be able to go to school, putting them at risk of losing education.
Stuart said.
Before the earthquake, Haiti had only one facility that produced prosthetic limbs.
There were about 800,000 Haitians with handicaps and disabilities before the earthquake, Doubt said.
Anticipating the need, the group Physicians for Peace has begun to collect prosthetics, crutches, canes, walkers and wheelchairs.
"We can reuse the components."
"I'm fully aware that they're not going to need the limbs for weeks, but it takes weeks to coordinate," Mills said.
Handicap International is also expanding its staff to around 100, and they will train local prosthetic technicians to meet the needs of amputees in the long term, Stuart said.
"Prosthetics need to be fitted -- they're not off the shelf -- so you need technicians there," Stuart said.
