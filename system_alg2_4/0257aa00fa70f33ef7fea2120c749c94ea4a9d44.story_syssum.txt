WASHINGTON (CNN) -- On their son's last night as president, a melancholy former President George H.W.
"We will miss coming and going, but it's time to move on," said the former president, who was a frequent visitor during his son's two terms in office.
Barbara Bush, who was first lady from 1989 to 1993, said the hardest part of the night was saying goodbye to the White House residence staff a second time.
In addition to the inauguration, the former first couple was to attend a final dinner at the White House with current President Bush, first lady Laura Bush and the first couple's two daughters, Barbara and Jenna.
