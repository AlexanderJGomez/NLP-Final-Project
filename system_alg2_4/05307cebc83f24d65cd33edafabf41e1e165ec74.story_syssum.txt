Suraya Pakzad tells CNN any deal between the U.S. and Taliban moderates should consider women's concerns.
Pakzad is one of several Afghan women's rights advocates who are in the U.S. capital this week to address a move the Obama administration is considering: reaching out to Taliban moderates in an effort to bring peace to Afghanistan.
"It makes me scared and everybody has the fear that one day [the Taliban] will be back again," Pakzad said.
When the Taliban were driven from power in 2001, Pakzad's Voice of Women Organization emerged from secrecy to expand its efforts to give women rights in the home, schools, the workplace, and the legislature.
But even now, women are still targets of domestic violence, and Afghan girls have been attacked for attending school.
"This is not custom.
She said she hopes that one day, Afghan women will secure the same rights that American women have achieved.
