(CNN) -- Small waves lap at the hulls of the ocean-going container ships as they approach the South African Port of Ngqura.
It's this combination of maritime port and landside infrastructure just outside the city of Port Elizabeth that is making the operation boom.
"We started off in October 2010 ... and from there on it's grown -- from one ship a week, sometimes we do between five and 10 ships a day now," he continues.
But a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers blames "comparatively high tariffs payable by vessels calling at South African ports" for the decline in shipping business.
"The Coega industrial development zone has a very important role to play in the economic growth of the area," says Christopher Mashigo, business development executive manager at the Coega Development Corporation.
A further 13,000 people received training there.
As well as individuals gaining skills and jobs, small and medium size businesses in the area are also benefiting from the zone.
"Up to this far even other companies, they're flocking to the Eastern Cape and mainly because Coega is heading most of the projects here in the Eastern Cape and then it has helped our business to grow as well.
The port is allowing some small business owners to grow their existing operation, but it's also leading to the beginnings of totally new businesses.
"Also there's no women that is an artisan in painting, so hopefully I'll be the first."
