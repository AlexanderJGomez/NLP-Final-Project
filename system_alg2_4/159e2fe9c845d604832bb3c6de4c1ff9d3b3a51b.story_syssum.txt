LONDON, England (CNN) -- Dean Still had been researching and developing cleaner, more environmentally-friendly wood-burning stoves for almost two decades when, while working for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, he spotted a coal stove for sale on a street corner near Tibet, China.
"I knew we could change it to a wood-burning stove.
Shen's factory began producing the new wood-burning stoves last year.
Others are sold in Argentina, Chile, the Marshall Islands, Madagascar, South Africa and Tanzania.
According to the World Health Organization, about half the world still cooks with biomass or coal, using open fires or traditional stoves.
ARC say tests performed on the stoves indicate major breakthroughs for both the environment and health in the developing world.
