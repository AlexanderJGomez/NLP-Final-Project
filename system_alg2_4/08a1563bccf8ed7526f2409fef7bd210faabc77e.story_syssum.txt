(CNN)Private spaceflight company SpaceX scrubbed a scheduled rocket launch Tuesday, in which it planned to attempt the pioneering step of landing the rocket's first stage on a floating platform.
"During the terminal count engineers observed drift on one of the two thrust vector actuators on the second stage that would likely have caused an automatic abort.
Traditionally, rockets have been designed to fall back to Earth after separating from the spacecraft they lifted, and then burn up on re-entry or crash into the ocean.
The company has twice attempted soft landings of the Falcon 9's first stage on water.
Landing on the platform "is significantly more challenging" than the water landings, the company said.
As for the target, "X" marks the spot: The company will try to land the rocket stage on the SpaceX logo painted on the center of the floating platform.
The timing of the next launch attempt will depend on how serious the problem is, he said.
