2 Petra Kvitova secured her first WTA Tour title of 2012 by defeating former French Open champion Li Na in Monday's final of the Rogers Cup.
She played very well in the second set.
Kvitova's triumph in Montreal was all the more impressive considering the 22-year-old suffers from asthma, which usually adversely affects her performances in North America due to the summer humidity.
Desite the loss, Li showed glimpses of the form which made her China's first grand slam singles champion at Roland Garros last year.
At the start of the second set Li, who has returned to the top 10 of the world rankings of the back of her performances in Canada, won 16 points in a row.
