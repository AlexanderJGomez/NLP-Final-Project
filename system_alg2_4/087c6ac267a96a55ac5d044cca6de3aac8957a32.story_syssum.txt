Dozens of armored military vehicles combed the streets of Rio on Saturday, video from CNN's Brazilian affiliate TV Record showed, as authorities prepare for another incursion into some of the city's notoriously dangerous shanty towns, including the Alemao favela complex -- a virtually impenetrable labyrinth of slums in the city's north.
At least 35 people have died, 174 arrested and 123 detained since violence broke out Sunday as a response by drug gangs to an increased police presence in the crime-ridden slums, known as favelas, police said, according to the official Agencia Brasil.
Gangs continued to torch buses and exchange fire with police Friday throughout the city's northern neighborhoods as more than 800 federal troops arrived to support Rio's civil authorities who are often outnumbered and outgunned by the powerful criminal groups.
According to local reports, the conflict began November 21 when disgruntled drug traffickers decided to launch an attack against Rio residents to protest the government's crackdown on their organizations.
But for the first time, Santos said, they will side with the police.
Brazil's President Luiz Inacio da Silva said his government will do all it can to support the government of Rio de Janeiro in its fight against drug gangs.
"The world's eyes are on Rio de Janeiro, praying that we find a solution to the security crisis, but also intent on knowing whether we are handling this as civilized people," Costa said.
