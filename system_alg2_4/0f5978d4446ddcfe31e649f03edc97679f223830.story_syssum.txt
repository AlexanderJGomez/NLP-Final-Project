There's still a Sunshine State for folks like us -- it's "Old Florida."
Sometimes thought of as "Forgotten Florida," I'm talking about the more northerly portions of the state.
They all thrive by crystal-clear rivers and springs.
And you can enjoy it all without devastating your wallet and facing large or pretentious crowds.
1.
Art is a big part of the town, with all manner of public displays popping up.
With such a relaxed atmosphere, Cedar Key has a bit of a Key West vibe -- minus the all-night party atmosphere.
2.
Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park
Do not skip the 15-minute-or-so boat ride from the parking area to the animal displays, where they take you down a narrow, blackwater creek.
3.
Alexander Springs is one of several in Ocala National Forest, a true gem of a wilderness that will evoke memories of "The Yearling" if you ever read that Pulitzer-winning novel.
4.
Way down upon the Suwannee River, far, far away from Florida's more crowded tourist sites, lies a pretty little state park not so far from Georgia and an easy jump off Interstate 75.
5.
Apalachicola oozes "Old Florida" charm.
Set alongside a namesake bay and river, this town has one foot in the workday world of harvesting the Gulf's riches and the other foot in artsy boutiques and the like.
I stayed across the bay in nearby Eastpoint, which is even smaller, more blue collar and boutique-free.
6.
Dune restoration and preservation are emphasized, and the park is a short drive from Eastpoint and Apalachicola.
7.
In the same general area as St. George, you can't go wrong with this park, either.
8.
Wakulla Springs State Park
9.
Amelia Island and Fernandina definitely have a Georgia/Carolinas kind of feel -- in a good way.
Downtown Fernandina is definitely the most upscale of the places on this list, but it still had a down-to-earth charm.
For my last meal in "Old Florida," I skipped the seafood and ate at The Happy Tomato.
What other parts of "Old Florida" have you explored and would recommend?
