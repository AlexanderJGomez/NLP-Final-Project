The 114-page report released by the Connecticut Office of the Child Advocate profiled the developmental and educational history of Lanza, the young man who carried out the mass killings at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012.
The report was dedicated to the 20 first-graders who died at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012.
In an email dated December 11, 2012,  three days before his attack, Lanza wrote to an unnamed chatter: "The inexplicable mystery to me isn't how there are massacres, but rather how there aren't 100,000 of them every year."
Adam enrolled in Sandy Hook Elementary School in the first grade after his family moved to Newtown, the report said.
It was during this late elementary school period that major mental health red flags were raised, the report said.
Warning signs like the book and Lanza's increasing anxiety were improperly addressed by Lanza's mother and educators, the report said.
The report singled out a period of homebound education during which Lanza was taken out of school during his eighth-grade year as an especially dangerous health care decision that contributed to his isolation and deterioration.
Calls for medication went unheeded by Nancy Lanza, however, whom the authors described as accommodating to her son's aversion to medication.
The report also noted that it appeared Nancy Lanza made no effort to curtail her son's access to guns in the house in the months leading up to the shooting, despite Adam's severe mental deterioration.
