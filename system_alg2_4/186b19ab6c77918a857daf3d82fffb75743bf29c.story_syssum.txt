Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN)  -- High in the hills above the Haitian capital, artist Levoy Exil paints at his terrace studio.
It's now apparent that among the earthquake's widespread destruction were museums, galleries and other places that contained Haiti's artistic treasures, including Exil's work.
"There is no art museum run by the government of Haiti," said Georges Nader Jr., who runs a gallery near the Nader museum opened by his father.
What will happen now?
"They're painting their lives.
They're recording their history," said Camille Scully, executive director of Iowa's Waterloo Center for the Arts and co-president of the Haitian Art Society.
One key figure who's been weighing in on the need to save what can be saved is Gerald Alexis, a leading Haitian art historian, critic and curator.
Haiti's art "will tell future generations who they are and where they come from," Alexis said.
In Port-au-Prince, Nader has been frantically trying to rescue the thousands of pieces his father lovingly collected over four decades.
Nader pulled out an oil-on-cardboard floral still-life painted by Hyppolite in 1945 that now looks more like a jigsaw puzzle with pieces missing.
"This?
The cultural loss can hardly compare.
On the second floor of his gallery, he and his staff have been collecting damaged pieces, their vibrant colors dulled by the dust.
So far, Nader has rescued about 1,000 pieces; 70 percent need restoration.
And, perhaps it will fuel a new wave of art that reveals the resilience of people here.
Now, he said, he will paint people screaming, piles of bodies and tents blanketing the city's open spaces.
High above the misery, Exil, too, said he will paint again.
He will make beauty blossom from the ugliness below.
For the future of Haiti.
