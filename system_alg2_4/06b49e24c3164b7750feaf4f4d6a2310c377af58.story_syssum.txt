"Friends that were on tour with me 20 years ago, 10 years ago, are now family guys married with kids," he said.
I want to surf better in 10 years.
For Slater, it's a journey that began as a child growing up in the surfing town of Cocoa Beach, in Florida.
They were just surfing and traveling and that's really been the goal my whole life."
"Surfing is my religion, if I have one," he said.
Some guys say it's like being in the womb.
"This section came at me, and I just launched myself, kind of a 'Hail Mary,'" said Slater.
But what's life worth?
"Big waves are a whole different ball game," said Slater.
Slater has been chasing waves his whole life.
That's what we do.
So waves for surfers are like balls for dogs.
