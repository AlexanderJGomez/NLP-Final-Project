(CNN) -- My great-grandmother used to laugh in moments of misfortune and confusion.
This trend came to a sickening halt this week when the Senate sought to extend critical protections to immigrant and Native American women, as well as LGBT people.
Before VAWA, women saw little incentive and an ominous downside to reporting abuse.
That led the Senate to pass an expanded version of the reauthorized bill -- one that extends protections to populations that remain vulnerable.
The need is clear: A full third of Native American women will be raped in their lifetimes; an even higher number will experience physical and emotional abuse.
These same husbands often threaten deportation and separation from children if their wives seek help or report abuse.
The reforms in the Senate bill that seek to right these devastating and rampant wrongs are modest and simple: Tribal authorities can prosecute offenses on reservations when state and federal prosecutors fail to do so, the government can issue a visa to abuse victims to halt deportation if they agree to testify against their abusers and shelters that receive federal grants are prohibited from discriminating against LGBT abuse victims who seek their services.
More protections for these immigrant women would cost Spivack's company a lot of money.
In the past couple of months, Americans lent their voices to the global chorus of horror as a young Indian woman died from internal injuries after being gang raped, and we shook our collective heads self-righteously when a Pakistani girl was shot by the Taliban simply for wanting an education.
And that's not a laughing matter, no matter how alien that makes me feel in my own home country.
