(CNN) -- Marvin Miller died Tuesday at the age of 95.Â  And here's why you should know his name: Miller transformed the game of baseball even though he never put on a uniform.
When the Brooklyn-born mustachioed man was named executive director of the Major League Baseball Player's Association in 1966, the average player's salary was just $7,000 a year.
One of the impacts was that players could be contractually obligated to work for one team in perpetuity through what was called the reserve clause.
This survived a series of court challenges and became the norm today.
Yes, fans are too often denied their game by selfish strikes perpetrated by players and owners alike.
The fact that Miller was denied entry into the Hall of Fame as recently as 2010 speaks to the influence of owners and their deep dislike of Miller's intrusions and innovations.
But the real tribute is all around us; in countless ways the national pastime has been transformed through the efforts of a man whose name you might not have heard before Tuesday night: Marvin Miller, R.I.P.
