The kind of battle we are seeing in Florida -- where Democrats and Republicans will go to court over whether early voting should span 14 days or eight -- simply does not happen in Germany, Canada, Britain or France.
In Germany, an independent federal returning officer oversees a complex state and federal voting system.
In Canada, federal elections are managed by a specialized agency, Elections Canada.

In every other democracy, the vote is the means by which the people choose between the competing political parties -- not one more weapon by which the parties compete.
