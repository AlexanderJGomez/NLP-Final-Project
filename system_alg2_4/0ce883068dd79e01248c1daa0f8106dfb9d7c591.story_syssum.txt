As a teenager, he survived two horrific years in concentration camps during the Holocaust, and lost his parents and siblings at the hands of the Nazis.
Martin Greenfield: It was our second day inside Auschwitz.
"He is a mechanic.
As soon as my father offered up my skills, two Germans walked toward us to take me away.
Fences and soldiers were everywhere.
My arms pumped hard as I stretched my stride and ran faster than I'd ever run before.
I snapped my head back over my shoulder and saw the dog closing in.
I shoved his head with both hands.
The two soldiers tromped over to retrieve the dog and make sure he was uninjured.
That day, my second inside Auschwitz, was the last time I ever saw my father.
Still, I grabbed a brush and an SS soldier's shirt and scrubbed hard and fast.
I scrubbed so hard the bristles ripped the collar.
The shirt was trash to the soldier but not to me.
Working in the laundry was a nice man who knew how to sew.
To this day I still don't know why, but when I got up the courage, I slipped the soldier's shirt on and wore it under my striped prisoner uniform.
They wanted to please the Germans, so some of them would be hard on us so the Germans would not punish them.
The shirt means something, I thought.
And so I wore the shirt.
They did for me.
Strangely enough, two ripped Nazi shirts helped this Jew build America's most famous and successful custom-suit company.
