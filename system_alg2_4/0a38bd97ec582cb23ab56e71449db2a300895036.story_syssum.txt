Washington (CNN) -- Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a key congressional voice on national security, announced Friday that he will not run for reelection this year.
Rogers, who has held a seat in Congress for more than a decade and is close to House Speaker John Boehner, has been a staunch supporter of National Security Agency surveillance programs, which came under fire after leaks by Edward Snowden publicly disclosed their sweeping nature.
Authorization for those programs expires on Friday, but President Barack Obama is expected to seek their temporarily renewal while Congress works on reform legislation, a senior administration official said.
But the Rothenberg Political Report and the Cook Political Report shifted their analysis of the district from "likely Republican" to "lean Republican" for the November election following Rogers' announcement.
"Mike has spent his entire life ensuring our country has been kept safe from threats both foreign and domestic," National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Greg Walden said in a statement.
Before Rogers became chairman, he issued an Intelligence Committee report "on Iran's nuclear ambitions, authored a bill to protect against chemical and biological threats, and co-authored legislation reauthorizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act," his Intelligence Committee biography said.
