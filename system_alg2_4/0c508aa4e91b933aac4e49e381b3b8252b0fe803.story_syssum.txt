The state-run Antara News Agency had said that two people were reportedly killed when a 12-bus convoy carrying employees of PT Freeport was attacked by unidentified gunmen in the country's eastern-most province.
"No shots were fired at the PT-FI bus convoy as earlier reported," the company said.
PT Freeport is the largest copper and gold mining company in the province.
No one died in the attacks, Antara said.
Meanwhile, authorities on Wednesday released sketches of two men believed to have carried out the bombings at the luxury hotels in Jakarta.
