Washington (CNN) -- A bomb threat made at an airport ticket counter in Dayton, Ohio, prompted a search of a US Airways flight that landed safely at Washington's Reagan airport Sunday, authorities said.
The plane was preparing to land when the airport was told to hold the flight, said Courtney Mickalonis, a spokeswoman for Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.
All passengers safely were taken off, and the bomb squad swept the plane, she said in an e-mailed statement.
But US Airways' express flights -- like the one from Dayton -- are experiencing delays as a result of the incident, airline spokeswoman Tina Swail said.
