"He's sleeping -- though his condition isn't stable yet," his daughter Dong Huixian told CNN.
The elder Dong is one of more than 140 people injured in a deadly attack Saturday night when ten knife-wielding assailants stormed the Kunming Railway Station in southwestern China, seemingly hacking at anyone in sight and killing at least 29 people.
"His whole face was covered in blood," his wife described the sight greeting the family at the hospital, which has received most of the people injured in the attack.
"But those with even more severe injuries need to be operated on first."
Last October, a jeep carrying a Uyghur family plowed into crowds in front of Tiananmen Gate in central Beijing, killing two tourists and injuring 40.
Far away from Beijing but a short drive from Dong's hospital is a small, nameless street in front of the massive Kunming Railway Station.
"So many people were trying to find a place to hide," the 27-year-old shop owner recalled to CNN.
"I saw four people die nearby," said 58-year-old Hu Xuerong.
In social media, some users' attempts to reflect on the root causes -- including waves of Han migration into Xinjiang and the treatment of Uyghurs in their native land -- to the latest terror were quickly drowned out by the overwhelming sound of fury.
"When they started hacking at people, they were already prepared to die," he said.
