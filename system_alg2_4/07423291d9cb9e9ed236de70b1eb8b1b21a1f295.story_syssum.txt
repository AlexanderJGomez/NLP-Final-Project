(CNN) -- The captain and chief officer of a Chinese-registered ship that ran aground on the Great Barrier Reef will appear in an Australian court Thursday, charged with damaging the reef.
He faces a maximum fine of A$55,000 (U.S. $50,852).
The ship was carrying about 65,000 tons of coal to China from the Australian port of Gladstone when it ran aground on the shoal -- a combination of shell and sand -- near the southernmost point of the Great Barrier Reef, just north of Great Keppel Island.
"He got 15 nautical miles (17.3 miles) off course, which is just outrageous," Adam Nicholson, a spokesman for Maritime Safety Queensland, said at the time.
