The phone-hacking scandal forced him to close the British tabloid that was his pride and joy, News of the World, and for a time even appeared to jeopardize his global empire, valued by Forbes at $9.4 billion.
In 2013, News International, the UK subsidiary of Murdoch's News Corp. was rebranded News UK, while News Corp. itself split into two separate entities.
The same year, Murdoch filed for divorce from his third wife, Wendi Deng.
"I was raised in a newspaper family by a father who believed that the newspaper was among the most important instruments of human freedom," Murdoch declared in his 2008 Boyer Lectures.
Mentored -- like his father -- by press baron Lord Beaverbrook, he learned his trade as a reporter in Birmingham, England and as a Â£10-a-week sub-editor at Beaverbrook's Daily Express in London before returning home to take charge of the family business.
"I found myself a newspaper proprietor at the age of 22," Murdoch said in 2008.
He was soon looking to expand the company: After buying up other local papers across the country, in 1964, he set up Australia's first national newspaper, The Australian, and in 1969, moved overseas to purchase his first UK paper, News of the World, shortly followed by The Sun.
That desire to be first with the big news has led some to question his methods -- even before the phone-hacking scandal.
"He was the man who tamed the print unions so that newspapers became incredibly profitable," said Martin Dunn, former deputy editor of the Sun and News of the World.
His youngest daughters Grace (born 2001) and Chloe (born 2003), with Wendi Deng, are both said to have a financial share in News Corp.
"Rupert wrote headlines, Rupert shaped stories, Rupert dictated the leads of stories," he said.
"He's a dealmaker, he's a brilliant businessman," Michael White, of the UK's Guardian newspaper, which broke the hacking story, told CNN.
"He's a great strategic mind."
