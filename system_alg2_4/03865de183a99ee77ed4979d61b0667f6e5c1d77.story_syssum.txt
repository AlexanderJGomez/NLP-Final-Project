"Ms. Huskins' whereabouts are unknown, and we are treating this matter as a kidnap for ransom," Park told reporters.
Huskins, who has been living in Vallejo the past year, is from Huntington Beach in Southern California, police said.
Park declined to comment on the nature of the relationship between Huskins and the 30-year-old man who saw and reported the kidnapping.
Authorities don't know when her vehicle was moved, police said.
Vallejo police asked the FBI to help their investigation.
