Williams ended the dreams of unseeded Czech Petra Kvitova with a 7-6 6-2 victory in their semifinal on Centre Court on Friday.
Williams broke the left-hander in the fifth game of the second set and extended her advantage in the penultimate game.
The 25-year-old Zvonareva reached her first grand slam final after seeing off Pirinkova, who beat Venus Williams in the quarterfinals.
The turning point of their match came in the sixth game of the second set as Zvonareva made the breakthrough on Pirinkova's service and went on to level at a set all.
A break in the very first game of the decider put Zvonoreva on top and she broke again as Pirinkova missed a forehand.
