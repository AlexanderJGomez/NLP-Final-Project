(CNN) -- Wednesday night's debate showcased a Mitt Romney resisting his worst debating weaknesses and playing solidly to his strengths.
They will need to study their take-home lessons.
Wednesday night?
He was strong in all areas Wednesday night.
Romney talked over him so often that I swear one time I saw Lehrer slumping behind his desk while he meekly gazed up at Romney and muttered, "Excuse me, I believe you have my stapler."
But he corrected the potential error and instead had a solid, conversational manner in the debate.
Romney put Obama on the defensive and kept him there all night defending his policies.
Wednesday night was no different.
This time, Obama clearly presented his theme.
What was it?
And it failed to put Romney on the defensive.
Which brings us to Obama's weaknesses: I wrote two days ago that his detachment was one weakness, that he can appear dispassionate and distancing to the audience.
For Obama, with a troubled economy, it works against the president.
You know it's bad when at the end of the debate, uber-wealthy Mitt Romney seems like he cares more about the middle class and even the lower class than the sitting Democratic president of the United States.
Obama needs to find a much more effective way to pin Romney down to a specific policy.
He simply has to put Romney on the defensive more often and provide arguments (and passion) that will resonate with voters.
Since Romney will continue to put him on the defensive (and this is guaranteed), Obama must turn potential flaws into strengths.
And for goodness sake, Obama, show more energy and passion.
He needs to keep debating precisely like Wednesday night.
If he decides that his bullying technique of the moderator was effective (it worked Wednesday night, but I wouldn't push my luck if I were him), then he risks alienating voters.
Romney can lose more votes than he can gain in future debates if he comes across as rude or mean, an impression many had of McCain four years ago.
