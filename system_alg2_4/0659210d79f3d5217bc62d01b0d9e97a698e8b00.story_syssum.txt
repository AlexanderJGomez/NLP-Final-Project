"Someone dared me to skate when I was 30," Schwartz said.
"I realized there was no program for adult skating," she said.
Schwartz was named chair of the first U.S Adult Figure Skating committee in 1995.
This year marks the 20th anniversary of the U.S Adult Figure Skating Championships; 600 skaters are expected to compete, including 47-year-old Beth Delano.
"I fell in love with it again," said Delano.
"They come from all over the world, every continent, it is just amazing," said Schwartz, who now chairs the international competition.
"(She's) well into her 80s now, who still skates at adult nationals, and is an inspiration," said Schwartz.
"Not only is adult skating wonderful exercise, but it creates a fabulous community of friends all over the country, and all over the world."
