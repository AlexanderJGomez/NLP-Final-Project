Salt spreaders and plows rumbled through Arlington, where sub-freezing temperatures hung in the air amid a mix of debilitating sleet and snow that canceled hundreds of flights Friday, raising questions about whether the Super Bowl host was ready for the rash of inclement weather.
"When you drive around here right now, there's nothing going on," Warner said.
Ice and snow slid off the stadium roof Friday and caused injuries to workers below, authorities said.
One man was struck in the head by ice and was in stable condition at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, said Lt. Pedro Arevalo of the Arlington Fire Department.
"We have been planning for this for a whole year," Librio said of Sunday's match-up between the Green Bay Packers and the Pittsburgh Steelers.
Both teams and their fans are cold weather clubs, accustomed to the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and Heinz Field in Pittsburgh.
The 1967 "Ice-Bowl," in which Green Bay eked out a 21-17 win over the Dallas Cowboys in the 35th National Football League championship game, was played amid teeth-chattering temperatures at Lambeau Field.
Sunday's game, Super Bowl XLV, is scheduled to begin at 6:30 p.m ET.
