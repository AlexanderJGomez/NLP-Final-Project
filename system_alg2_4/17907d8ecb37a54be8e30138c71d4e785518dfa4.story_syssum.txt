"If you ask me this question in 10 years' time I will tell you less, because two championships are more than I could dream," the Formula One driver told CNN.
Since winning his second world F1 title for Renault in 2006, Alonso has endured a frustrating time on the track.
But a third world title has remained just out of reach -- the 32-year-old has finished second to Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel in three of the past four seasons.
"These were four very demanding and important days to give us something to work on over the coming days in Maranello," team principal Stefano Domenicali told Ferrari F1's official website.
"We are discovering every day new things about the car and new possibilities, so I think the potential is there," he said.
"They are ugly, yeah.
"So probably we will get used to these new aesthetics, let's say, but the first moment they are not good enough because people look at Formula One like excellence of motor sport, of aerodynamics, excellence of performance and technology -- and when you see those front part of the car, it doesn't look like all the things we've been saying.
"I think he's very talented so that is a huge help and a huge motivation for myself first and also for the team, because the team knows it has to deliver a good car because Kimi will deliver a good result," Alonso said.
"The day that I received the news I could not believe it, to be honest, because he is not a man that you think will have any problem.
Alonso's quest for a third drivers' championship title begins in Melbourne on March 16.
