"The team had been number one in the world, or close to it, for a lot of years during the disappointment of not winning it," McCaw told CNN's Human to Hero series.
I certainly appreciated it.
The traditional Maori war dance that the All Blacks perform before every match -- known as "the Haka" -- is one of the most fearsome, and highly anticipated, sights on the international rugby stage.
"It is something very unique to New Zealand," McCaw said.
"Up until the (2011) World Cup, everyone acknowledged, "Ah the All Blacks are great,' but there was always a 'but' -- I suppose because they hadn't won the World Cup.
McCaw reached his century of caps in the third pool game against France, but his foot problem ruled him out of the match against Canada -- and international rugby's record points scorer Carter, who was to replace him as captain, then suffered a tournament-ending injury in training.
"I've had the odd moment since Dan went down this afternoon where I thought, 'Jesus, it could be the two of us.'
Unlike Dan, I've still got a chance of playing and somehow, any old how, that's what I've got to do."
"I was about age 6 and watching it on TV.
I thought it would be pretty cool to be like him."
Having finally landed New Zealand's holy grail, McCaw is hoping to play at the next World Cup in England in 2015, when he'll be 35.
"I'm pretty keen to get away and have a look at places I've haven't been before and where rugby is not something people know too much about.
He flies planes, helicopters and gliders, and has even narrated an aviation TV program.
When I go home to the old man we sit and talk way more about flying than rugby," McCaw says in "The Open Side."
When he returns from his sabbatical in mid-2013, McCaw knows that the rugby world will be trying to knock him and the All Blacks off their pedestal.
I know what it's like, I've tried to knock off the world champs the following year.
