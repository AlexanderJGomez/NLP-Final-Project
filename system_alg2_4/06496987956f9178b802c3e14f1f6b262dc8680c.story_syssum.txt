LONDON, England (CNN) -- British Airways said Tuesday it was in talks with Australian rival Qantas that could see a merger of two of the world's most prestigious airlines.
BA said the talks would not affect its negotiations in Spanish airline Iberia, with which it is already discussing a revenue deal with American Airlines.
BA, American Airways and Iberia in August opened negotiations over a revenue deal, filing for antitrust immunity for the tie-up.
BA and Qantas have for many years co-operated on the so-called "Kangaroo Route" including sharing revenues on UK-Australia routes, Quest said.
The airline also announced it was slashing its work force by 1,500 people worldwide, abandoning plans to hire 1,200 more as high fuel costs squeezed profits.
