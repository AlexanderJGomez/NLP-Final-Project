An injured Morgan McCracken has benefited from awareness after Natasha Richardson's death.
"For the next two days, she was perfectly fine," Donald McCracken says.
But after hearing about Richardson's death, the McCrackens wondered if Morgan was really as OK as she seemed.
The McCrackens took Morgan to the emergency room at LakeWest Hospital in neighboring Willoughby, where doctors ordered a CT scan and immediately put Morgan on a helicopter to Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, with her father by her side.
He whisked Morgan into the operating room, pausing for a moment to tell McCracken that his daughter had the same injury as Richardson: an epidural hematoma.
After surgery and five days in the hospital, she's at home and doing fine.
Now the McCrackens sometimes wonder if they waited too long to get Morgan to a doctor.
In most cases, it's pretty clear when someone needs medical attention after a head injury, says Greg Ayotte, a spokesperson for the Brain Injury Association of America and a cognitive rehabilitation therapist.
In the case of epidural hematomas, the injury Richardson and Morgan had, blood pools in the area between the lining of the brain and the skull.
