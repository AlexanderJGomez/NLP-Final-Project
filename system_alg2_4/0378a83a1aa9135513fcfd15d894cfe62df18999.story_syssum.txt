(CNN) -- A U.S. airstrike in Syria appears to have killed a key French jihadist who is part of the militant Khorasan Group, a U.S. defense official said Thursday morning.
Later Thursday morning, the U.S. military's Central Command announced that five U.S. airstrikes targeted the Khorasan Group in Syria on Wednesday night.
The strikes happened in the area of Sarmada, Syria, the military said.
Those attacks came amid intelligence that suggested the group was plotting against a target in the U.S. homeland as well as other Western targets, a senior U.S. official told CNN at the time.
Drugeon was born in 1989 in a blue-collar and immigrant neighborhood dotted with social housing on the outskirts of Vannes on the Atlantic coast of Brittany, according to Eric Pelletier, a reporter with L'Express who has extensively reported on Drugeon and shared his findings with CNN.
Drugeon began acting out, and his grades at school nosedived.
Before he turned 14 he converted, changing his name to Daoud.
By 2010, Drugeon was on the radar screen of French security services and had made several trips to Egypt to learn Arabic and more about Islam.
He took on a new fighting name "Souleiman" and made several forays into Afghanistan, according to Pelletier.
U.S. officials told CNN they believe Drugeon has been heavily involved in facilitating the movement of fighters to and from Europe, and in planning attacks in Europe.
