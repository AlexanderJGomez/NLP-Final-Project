"It is a sacred thing to create a face," says Wallace Chan, 58, the Chinese artisan jeweler that produced the piece.
"It's like a ghost appearing in the gem as you work.
It's not the first time that Chan has "created" a human face in a jewel.
"When you work from the back of the jewel, right is left, top is bottom and deep becomes shallow.
So he developed a technique of working under cold water.
I make one cut, take it out of the water to check it, dry the stone, check it again, and if it's fine I put it back in the water and make another cut."
"My mind is one with the work, and my physical self is removed from the gemstone," he explains.
After being commissioned by a Taiwanese art collector to make a jeweled "stupa", or Buddhist reliquary, Chan's focus shifted from sculpture to jewelery and he began to explore innovative techniques.
He also experimented with using gems to fix each other in place, rather than metal settings, as well as new methods of cutting jade.
The rest is history.
This year, he showed "Vividity", a brooch featuring a deep pink, 64-carat Elbaite tourmaline surrounded by rubies and colored diamonds.
Most of his work is sold directly to collectors, who are loath to sell them on.
"Each piece can take me thousands of hours," he says.
