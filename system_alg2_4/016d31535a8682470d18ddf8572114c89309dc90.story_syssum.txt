I'm afraid for my life," Haymanot, who is an illegal immigrant awaiting refugee status, told CNN.

Attorney Asaf Weitzen, who works with the immigrant hotline in the south Tel Aviv neighbourhood of Hatikva, trying to sort out immigrants' legal problems, says: "There is a very big pressure on the neighborhood, and the structures cannot support so many people."
The biggest problem that immigrants and Israel face, Weitzen says, is the lack of a proper and enforceable immigration policy.

In May an anti-immigration protest numbering several hundred demonstrators boiled over into all-out violence bashing in a few store and car windows owned by African immigrants.
Israeli protesters chanted slogans such as "infiltrators get out" and "Tel Aviv: A refugee camp".
In two separate cases in May, two African illegal immigrants were arrested and charged with raping teenage Israeli girls, sparking even more tension between the communities in some parts of the country.

Amene Tekele Haymanot, who works and lives in Hatikva, says that his Israeli neighbors continue to make threats and intimidate him even after breaking apart his business.
