The eurozone fiscal pact has to be ratified by 12 participating nations.
• The legal framework will see those signed up to the deal effectively hand more sovereign powers over to centralized European control.
• The current European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the money-lending safety net created by the eurozone last year to combat the crisis, will be phased out in mid-2013.
Bailout money comes from selling bonds guaranteed by eurozone countries.
That cash will likely come from national treasuries.
The €200 billion earmarked for the IMF will come from Europe's national central banks.
No.
Some say this will result in a two-tier European Union.
This leaves Britain, under Prime Minister David Cameron, alone among the 27 European Union nations to point-blank refuse to sign.
He said he had effectively vetoed an original deal, forcing German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy to forge ahead with a treaty that will be subservient to EU regulations.
With Britain forcing the treaty to operate outside EU mechanisms, there could be an appetite among the rest of Europe to cold shoulder the UK and concentrate resources within their new club.
The new treaty was not due to be finalized until March this year -- after which it will have to be ratified by all participating countries.
Ideally, everyone will stick to the new rules, and those countries that require emergency bailouts will be granted them, allowing the European Union to slowly put its debt problems behind it.
