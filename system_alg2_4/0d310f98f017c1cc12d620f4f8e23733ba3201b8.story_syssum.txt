But the loss to local London rivals Chelsea will be the most difficult to stomach with the margin of defeat equaling Wenger's worst loss -- 8-2 by Manchester United in 2011 -- at the club.
Mourinho's side were two goals up after seven minutes as first Samuel Eto'o then Andre Schurrle scored.
After the match, Wenger shouldered the blame for the heavy defeat and conceded it had been one of the worst days of his career.
"I don't think there's too much need to talk about the mistakes we made.
It's over after 20 minutes and it's a long game after that.
It's a huge disappointment today, but we want to win the next game now."
It's a different situation to Liverpool, and Manchester City are also not in that situation.
Yaya Toure scored a hat-trick (two goals coming from the penalty spot) with Fernandinho and Martin Demichelis adding two late on to keep Manuel Pellegrini's side third on 63 points, but with three games in hand.
Manchester United backed up a promising Champions League win in midweek with a 2-0 win at West Ham United.
Norwich City eased relegation worries with a 2-0 win over fellow strugglers Sunderland -- Chris Hughton's side are up to 13th with 31 points.
Hull City further improved their survival hopes with a 2-0 win over West Bromwich Albion.
