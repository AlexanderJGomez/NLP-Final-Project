Marquez equaled Valentino Rossi's record of 10 podium placings in his rookie season, set back in 2000, and became the first rider since the Italian in 2008 to win four successive races.
"Before we came here I didn't expect win, because Jorge and Valentino had both tested at Brno recently and Dani is always so fast here and won the race last year," Marquez told the MotoGP website.
"I am very happy with the result, because after all the problems with my injury and the doubts we've had at the last few races, we took a big step forward with my mental preparation today," he said.
We need just a few tenths to win the race so we have to pray for that at Silverstone," the Spaniard said.
Eventually though I couldn't keep the same distance to second place so little by little they caught me.
