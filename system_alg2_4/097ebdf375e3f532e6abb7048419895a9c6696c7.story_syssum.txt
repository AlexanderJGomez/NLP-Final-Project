Xinhua said that Zhuang, who was considered one of the best players in the world in the 1960s, had met U.S. table tennis player Glenn Cowan at a tournament in Japan.
"We were all tense," Zhuang told CNN in 2008.
Pictures of their encounter spread around the world, and, under the orders of Chinese leader Mao Zedong, the U.S. team was invited to visit China.
Their journey turned out to be the first public move in a rapprochement between the two bitter enemies.
An innovative "pen-hold" style propelled him to the top of his sport.
According to Xinhua, Zhuang had been suffering from colon cancer since 2008 and died in a Beijing hospital on Sunday after developing liver and lung complications.
