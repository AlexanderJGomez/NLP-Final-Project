In a televised address, Maduro said Caracas Mayor Antonio Ledezma was captured by order of the Attorney General's Office.
A high-level Venezuelan military source with knowledge of the situation told CNN en Español the mayor was taken into custody because of his alleged involvement in a plot to overthrow the government an accusation Maduro leveled last week.
The mayor's office told CNN en Español that more than 150 intelligence agents participated in Thursday's raid.
Richard Blanco, an opposition Venezuelan lawmaker whose office is also in the building, said he witnessed Ledezma's arrest.
Opposition leaders said Ledezma was a political prisoner unjustly held by the government.
In his national broadcast Thursday night, Maduro repeated accusations that his government had blocked a U.S.-backed opposition coup plot that included plans to attack the presidential palace with a military jet.
"Venezuela's economic and political problems are the result of the policies of the Venezuelan government.
