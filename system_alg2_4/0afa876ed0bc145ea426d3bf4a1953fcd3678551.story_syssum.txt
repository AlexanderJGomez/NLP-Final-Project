Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Abu Ali is 58 years old.
Their son Ali -- 19 and a week away from his wedding -- was working on the family stall when one of Baghdad's ubiquitous car bombs targeted the market area.
Abu Ali doesn't stop crying the entire time we are with the family.
Together they had three children: a son, also called Ali, now aged three, and daughters Rukkaya, four, and Narjis, eight months.
In July last year the family was preparing for their annual pilgrimage to the holy city of Najaf, where Ali is buried, to honor his memory.
Abu Ali has now lost all three sons.
Abu Ali and his wife, Umm Ali, at first couldn't face telling them the truth, instead saying he'd gone to Mosul for more watermelons.
"We tell them he has gone to paradise and is watching over them, but Ali especially cannot comprehend," says Abu Ali.
Alaa's other child, the baby daughter Narjis, was just a few weeks old when her father died.
She counts again, and then once more.
The family hasn't seen or heard from him since.
The watermelon stand was the family's only income.
Six people are crammed into the home, Abu Ali and Umm Ali, and Alaa's widow and three children.
"They were our bread winners," says Abu Ali.
I have lost three sons and the fourth fled and no one cares about us."
We leave Abu Ali and Umm Ali and the grandchildren they now raise and they thank us for telling their story to the world.
