(CNN) -- China's 700 million smartphone users will no longer be able to share stories about politics without official approval, according to new regulations announced by authorities on Thursday, which took immediate effect.
Public accounts on any mobile IM platform will also need to register with authorities using the real names of the owners.
Prominent Weibo users were later detained or prosecuted, on charges both related and unrelated to their online activities.
Another user of a popular WeChat account on current affairs said that the new regulation "will definitely impact what I'm going to post in the future.
"It's quite obvious now, other public accounts are definitely going to be more cautious about republishing political news because no one knows how strongly the rules will be enforced.
The three-year-old WeChat, owned by Tencent holdings, is unlike any other mobile app.
"And Tencent always devotes to create a healthy and secure online environment for our users.
