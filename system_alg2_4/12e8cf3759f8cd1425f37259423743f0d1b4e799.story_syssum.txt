But four months of recounts and reviews and then a runoff changed everything, and the unexpected candidate is poised now to move into the presidential office.
It's an image that Martelly said he cultivated solely for the stage.
Martelly, they said, was a fresh face in politics, untainted by the corruption that has marred many a presidency in Haiti.
"To Haitians, particularly the legions of young and jobless, Martelly is an outsider who can bring change to Haiti," longtime Haiti observer Jocelyn McCalla said on Twitter.
Martelly won by a landslide with 67.6% of the vote, soundly defeating his challenger, former first lady Mirlande Manigat, who received 31.5%.
But at first, the election council said Martelly had placed third, behind Manigat and Celestin, meaning he was not eligible for a runoff.
Then came a review of the vote, monitored by the Organization of American States.
He sat at a table surrounded by a piano and eight wall-mounted speakers.
Haiti, he said then, was on the brink of revolution.
Martelly spoke of 24 years of troubled times, of a poor country that, he said, hurtled backward into even more poverty.
he said.
The people know him, he said.
"People are fed up here," he said.
Martelly exuded confidence that he could bring change to Haiti.
"I think Haiti needs a fresh start.
"Martelly spoke in a way Aristide spoke to the people," Pierre-Pierre said.
But look what happened to Aristide, Pierre-Pierre said, referring to the fall of Haiti's first democratically elected president, who coincidentally returned from exile just days before last month's election.
"He is a musician and a good one at that," he said.
Irwin Stotzky, a University of Miami lawyer who has studied human rights in Haiti, said Martelly hardly had the credentials to run the country and did not see much hope for the immediate future.
"Well," he said.
