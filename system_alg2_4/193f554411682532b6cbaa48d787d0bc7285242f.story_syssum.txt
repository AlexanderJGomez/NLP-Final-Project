(CNN) -- Convertibles are selling well at the Mercedes Benz dealership in Sendai in North Japan.
In the aftermath the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, business across Sendai is experiencing a reconstruction bounce.
"People used to try not to spend so much and save money, but after the quake, (they) spend more on luxurious cars, also because the stock market and exchange market are not doing well now."
Analysts say much of Japan's trade deficit comes from increased importation and prices for natural gas and oil, which has increased in use since much of the nation's nuclear power supply has been taken offline.
"One year on from the earthquake, Japan's economy remains deeply affected by the disaster," Takehide Kiuchi, chief economist of Nomura Securities, wrote in a recent research report.
"In contrast to the great efforts made by the private sector, the response of the authorities has left much unresolved," Kiuchi said.
Our administrative structure is the most inefficient in the world.
He hopes the rebuilding will not be a return to the old ways, but an opportunity to reform the government and make Japan's economy more integrated with the outside world.
"My phone didn't stop ringing."
Many say there is also a change in attitude towards spending, with locals flocking to luxury stores in a way they didn't see before the quake.
"We used to think, 'let's wait' even though we wanted to buy," says one shopper, carrying a bag from Louis Vuitton.
