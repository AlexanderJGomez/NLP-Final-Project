The U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Department of Interior this week shared a photo of a Weddell seal nuzzling up to what looked to be its mom in Erebus Bay, Antarctica.
It's hard to know what she was thinking when her baby nuzzled up to her in this photo, but Link said the animals flare their noses when disturbed, "so this Mom was pretty relaxed," Link told CNN Friday.
"Because of its isolation, this population is undisturbed by human activities.
Link said it was a privilege to see the animals up close.
After a seal pup is born, Link said its mom spends all her time close to her baby in a very small area, with hardly any interaction with other seals.
