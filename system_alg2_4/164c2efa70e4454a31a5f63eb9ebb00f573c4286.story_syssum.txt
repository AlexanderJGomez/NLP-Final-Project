And yet we can at least make a guess at what will happen in the early part of next year simply by looking at the trends that are shaping the latter half of this year.
1.
These new interfaces essentially impose a touchscreen-inspired interface over the traditional desktop environment.
2.
In the social media realm, social gestures appear to be the leading trend of 2012.
3.
Next year is likely to be the year when mobile payments blossom.
4.
Why?
Why does one device constitute an entire trend?
5.
The cable companies have a cunning plan: They'll let you watch live TV, plus on-demand movies and TV shows, on your connected devices if you keep your cable subscription.
6.
Surely voice control has been around for years?
7.
8.
The chances are that you already use your tablet computer or phone while watching TV, so there's ample opportunity to make the viewing experience a more interactive one.
9.
Can I squeeze in one more trend?
As developers tire of building applications for every operating system out there -- from Android to iOS to Windows Phone and beyond -- HTML5 offers the opportunity to build an app once and have it work everywhere.
In short, 2012 is all about new ways to interact with our devices through touch and voice control, new lightweight ways to share content, a revolution in mobile payments and a plethora of rich Web applications -- not to mention the hundreds of new innovations that we've yet to dream up.
