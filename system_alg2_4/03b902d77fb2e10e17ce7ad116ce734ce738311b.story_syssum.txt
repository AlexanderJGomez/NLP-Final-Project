But allegations of American spying have seriously injured German trust, Chancellor Angela Merkel has said.
Two Germans -- one working at a German intelligence agency, the other in the Ministry of Defense -- are suspected of spying for the United States.
Top German government officials have candidly spoken about the decision to expel the U.S. official as they poured their disappointment over alleged U.S. spying into microphones and cameras for days.
He based his remarks on the essential value of Germany's cooperation with U.S. intelligence agencies to fight international terrorism and complained that spying spoils the relationship.
One of the new cases has landed on top of an existing investigation on federal prosecutors' desks into the possible spying on Merkel.
We have so many problems, and we should, I find, concentrate on the essentials."
During the Cold War, high-level spy scandals stoked division between then divided democratic West Germany and communist East Germany.
While the official said U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and German Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier will touch on topics such as the Middle East and Ukraine, it'd be hard to imagine the two ignoring the spy issue.
