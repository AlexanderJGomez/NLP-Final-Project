It's been a rough week for Alec Baldwin.
On Friday Baldwin posted a statement on MSNBC's website saying, "I did not intend to hurt or offend anyone with my choice of words, but clearly I have -- and for that I am deeply sorry.
"I understand 'Up Late' will be taken off the schedule for tonight and next week.
Baldwin responded with his own series of tweets.
He also said "1-Rich Ferraro from @glaad informs me that c'sucker is an anti-gay epithet.
This is not the first time Baldwin has had a run-in with paparazzi.
Baldwin said the photographer bumped him with his camera.
