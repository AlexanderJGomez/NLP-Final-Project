(CNN) -- Drew ushered Jackie into a bedroom, shutting the door behind them.
Jackie began to scream.
"Its."
The article continues: Jackie's friends, two guys and one woman, ultimately decided she shouldn't be taken to the hospital or report the rape because if she did, "her reputation will be shot for the next four years."
On the day the Rolling Stone article about Jackie's alleged rape was published, Caitlin Kelly, a Web producer at The New Yorker, wrote a string of tweets imagining what it would look like if people responded to her wallet being stolen the way they respond to rape.
"'I think that guy I know stole my wallet,'" Kelly tweeted, followed by the hypothetical responses:
Just curious, just trying to get a better sense of what's going on here.
"All guys want wallets, it's just in their nature.
In the Rolling Stone article, Jackie describes how she ran into Drew (not his real name) during her lifeguard shift at a UVA pool, just two weeks after her alleged rape. "
" Could you imagine Drew parading around like nothing had happened if he'd just committed a murder?
It was not until Rolling Stone started poking around and asking questions about the rape allegations that the university began to investigate the matter.
On the other hand, Drew, as of the writing of the Rolling Stone article, was set to graduate, entirely untarnished -- as were the other men involved in the alleged rape.
But rape?
If UVA has any sense of moral rightness and wishes to remain a great university, it should conduct a thorough investigation into these and similar allegations and mete out appropriate punishment for the perpetuators.
