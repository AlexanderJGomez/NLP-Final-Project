Zahra Rahnavard, wife of Iranian candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi, has taken a visible role in the campaign.
Whether her husband wins or loses Friday, Rahnavard has broken barriers for women just by appearing on the campaign trail with her husband, a rarity for political wives in Iran.
More women than men have voted in the past few elections, and Rahnavard has made a promise to her female supporters that their vote will count this time if Moussavi wins.
"We have made this promise to the women, and we will stand by it," she said.
"For Ahmadinejad's government, women are just living things," Eshraghi said.
Moussavi is not the only candidate calling for a stronger role for women in Iran.
"If Ahmadinejad does well in the debates, I don't think anyone will be able to defeat him," Marandi said.
"This is the first time after the revolution we see a lady behind the president," Farhad Mahmoudi said.
