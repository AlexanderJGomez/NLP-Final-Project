On the campaign trail, the support of tea party groups has helped launch campaigns and is a force candidates ignore at their peril.
"We're not a protest movement anymore; we've morphed into something else," said Matt Kibbe, president of FreedomWorks, which has helped support tea party groups around the country.
Expanding on its 2010 congressional election victories, the tea party has become a major factor in the presidential race this election cycle.
The bloc has become so powerful, she said, that a Republican could not win his or her party's nomination without tea party support.
Though tea party leaders maintain the movement will not become a political party and comprises activists of all political stripes, Kremer said most tea partiers expected better from their GOP elected officials.
The question now is whether the tea party will push candidates far enough to the right during the primaries that it could hurt their chances at winning a general election.
"When you're fighting congressional and House seats you can choose your champions, you can choose your battles, you can fight this race and not that race," he said.
Griffin said that could make members of the party more cautious in choosing a nominee.
Griffin expects eventually both the GOP party establishment and tea party voters will come around to support the party's candidate so long as they see winning back the White House as a real possibility.
"The tea party is an organic movement that was largely created by people who were frustrated by Washington," he said.
You cannot crush that out given the noise coming out of Washington these days."
