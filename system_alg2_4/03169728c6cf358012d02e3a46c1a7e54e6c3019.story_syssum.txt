Seven Pakistani women are trained to fly the country's F-7 fighter jets -- though none have seen combat so far.
How will you fly?"
Today Gul is one of seven women who are trained and ready to fly Pakistan's F-7 supersonic fighter jets.
Humility doesn't mean lack of confidence.
To become a fighter pilot takes three years of training at the Air Force Academy in Risalpur, Pakistan, where the halls are lined with grainy black-and-white pictures of nearly six decades of male graduates who went on to fly for the Pakistan Air Force.
Most say changing the misconception of Muslim women is just as important as serving their country.
"To tell you the truth I've been given equal opportunity or I suppose more than men have been given," says Air Force cadet Sharista Beg.
Ambreen Gul says her goal now is to fly in combat.
