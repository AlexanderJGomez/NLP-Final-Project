(CNN) -- A recent CNN.com op-ed asked "Was the Shell Oil hoax ethical?"
A hoax the company has failed to reveal to the public.
In the Arctic, the oil giant is exploiting melting sea ice to drill for more of the oil causing global warming in the first place.
The same drill ship can't meet the Clean Air Act standards the company agreed to earlier this year, and so Shell is asking the EPA to bend the rules at the 11th hour.
An oil spill response barge, the Arctic Challenger, which Shell promised the U.S. Coast Guard was "Arctic ready," is in Washington state, beset with technical problems.
We came up with ArcticReady.com.
And when people realize it's a parody, they like it even more.
People clearly want an opportunity to tell Shell what they think of the company's Arctic drilling program, and our site has provided them with a voice.
But Shell and its sympathizers would like people to talk about Greenpeace and the Yes Men rather than what the company is doing in the Arctic.
We're Greenpeace and the Yes Men, and we're ready to sit down with Shell any time to debate the ethics of Arctic drilling.
