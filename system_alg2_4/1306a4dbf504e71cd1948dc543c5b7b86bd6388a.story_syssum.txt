(CNN) -- Manchester United was left reeling Sunday after a demoralizing loss to arch-rival Liverpool that kept it a dozen points adrift of a Champions League spot but there was respite for under-fire manager David Moyes and his team Wednesday.
"I said to (my team) on Monday morning we have to win 3-0, give the crowd something back because the crowd here has been incredible," Moyes, the successor to managerial giant Alex Ferguson at United, told Sky Sports.
"I know the job I have to do.
It's a big job.
And when Rooney struck the post in the 18th minute, some of the United fans must have thought this might not be their night.
Giggs, however -- and not for the first time in his stellar career -- split open the Olympiacos defense with a diagonal ball that reached van Persie.
But Olympiacos was dealt a blow when van Persie converted Rooney's low cross -- after Giggs' pivotal ball -- in first-half injury time.
Olympiacos pushed forward and although De Gea had to be sharp, he and the United defense held firm to the delight -- and relief -- of most of those at Old Trafford.
"Maybe they wanted to see a 6-1 win, but that does not happen every day," he told reporters.
"We have had a lot of injuries this season, but this result shows we are well prepared."
