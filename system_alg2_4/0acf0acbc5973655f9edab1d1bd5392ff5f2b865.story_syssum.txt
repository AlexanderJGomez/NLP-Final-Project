The National Transportation Safety Board recommended on Tuesday that all 50 states adopt a blood-alcohol content (BAC) cutoff of 0.05 compared to the 0.08 standard on the books today and used by law enforcement and the courts to prosecute drunk driving.
Hersman said progress has been made over the years to reduce drunk driving, including a range of federal and state policies, tougher law enforcement, and stronger advocacy.
What will be our legacy 30 years from now?"
Under current law, a 180-pound male typically will hit the 0.08 threshold after four drinks over an hour, according to an online blood alcohol calculator published by the University of Oklahoma.
It cannot impose its will through regulation and can only recommend changes to federal and state agencies or legislatures, including Congress.
In the early 1980s, when grass-roots safety groups brought attention to drunk driving, many states required a 0.15 BAC rate to demonstrated intoxication.
In recent years, about 31 percent of all fatal highway accidents were attributed to alcohol impairment, the NTSB said.
Many of the recommendations "are going to be unpopular," Sumwalt said.
The NTSB has asked all 50 states to do the same.
The group said it based that conclusion on a chart it said was used by auto safety regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
At Tuesday's meeting, the safety board also championed laws allowing police to confiscate a motorist's license at the time of arrest if the driver exceeds a BAC limit, or refuses to take the BAC test.
The sensor is capable of detecting alcohol even in cases where the driver has attempted to disguise his breathe with gum or mints.
The NTSB recommended last December that states require ignition interlocks for all DUI offenders and said states should improve interlock compliance.
