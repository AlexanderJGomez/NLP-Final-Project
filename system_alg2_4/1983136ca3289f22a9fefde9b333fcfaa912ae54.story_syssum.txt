Eight of the United States' 13 missile defense tests have been deemed a success.
Officials told CNN on Thursday that Friday's test would be the most realistic of 13 missile shield system tests conducted to date.
In Friday's test, however, the target was a mock warhead and was supposed to be accompanied by "countermeasures similar to what Iran or North Korea could deploy," according to a missile defense agency official.
But the decoy that was supposed to deploy to test the system did not.
