LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The first search of Michael Jackson's bedroom a day after his death found marijuana, skin-bleaching and hair-growing ointments, anti-insomnia pills and empty bottles of several anti-anxiety drugs, according to court documents unsealed Thursday.
Martinez filed his report on what was found in the search five days later.
A source with knowledge of the probe told CNN Thursday that a test later showed that a brown, sticky substance found in the search was not heroin.
An online search found medical journal references to this glaucoma medication also used to stimulate hair growth.
Also listed on the detective's report was Benoquin ointment, a medication used to lighten skin pigmentation in people with vitiligo, a skin condition.
