(CNN) -- Echoing outrage seen in the streets of Indian cities after a deadly gang-rape in New Delhi, protesters in India's northern neighbor Nepal are also demanding their government take action over violence against women.
"The media attention to protests in Delhi has raised awareness on issues of violence against women in Nepal," said Manju Gurung, of Pourakhi, an organization that advocates for female migrant workers.
Their outrage focused on several cases of alleged rape and abuse against women, including that of the migrant worker, whom they refer to as Sita Rai.
On November 18, the woman returned home to Nepal on vacation from Saudi Arabia, where she works as a domestic worker, said Basanta Bahadur Basnet, a lawyer who represents the woman.
In mid-December, she filed the case in Kathmandu, and it began to gain attention in Nepal around the same time as news of the gang-rape attack in New Delhi emerged.
Parsuram Basnet has been suspended from his job as a police officer at the airport, but he cannot be removed from his job until the verdict, said Dhiraj Pratap Shingh, a spokesman for Kathmandu District Police.
The defense questioned the timing of the woman's rape complaint saying, "She filed a case so late because others told her to do so.
"We are pushing for female immigration officers at the airport and strict monitoring to prevent such incidents," Gurung said.
