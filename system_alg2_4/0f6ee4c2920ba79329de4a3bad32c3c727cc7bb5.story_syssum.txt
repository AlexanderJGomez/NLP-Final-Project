Federer recorded the second double bagel of his career when he defeated wildcard Mischa Zverev 6-0 6-0 on Friday to reach the semifinals of a Wimbledon warm-up in Halle, Germany.
He lost to Tomas Berdych in the U.S. Open quarterfinals last September, Andy Murray in January's Australian Open semifinals and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in this month's French Open quarterfinals.
Haas and Federer, good friends, played doubles together this week in Halle.
Haas, the 35-year-old third seed, rallied from a set down to oust Gael Monfils 6-7 (4) 6-3 6-3.
"I thought the first set was good, and then he started playing much better in the second," Murray said in a televised interview.
The conditions were tough, again, but it's only my first week on grass."
Del Potro, still learning the finer points of playing on grass, missed the French Open due to illness.
As in Halle a back-to-back winner remains a possibility because Croatian Marin Cilic, the fifth seed, edged Berdych 7-5 7-6 (4).
