In Syria, meanwhile, despite the intensified world pressure for President Bashar al-Assad to halt the violence and step down, his security forces continued their tough offensive against protesters.
"We acted pretty quickly and have now got an oil embargo in the works," said Michael Mann, spokesman for EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton.
Those will be examined early next week, Ashton said.
Much of Syria's oil sales go to European Union countries, analysts say.
"We are urging that these are unarmed protesters, and there's been excessive force used against them, and this force must stop," she said Friday.
One opposition activist group, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, called the street presence on Friday "one of the most important during the course of the protest movement" across the country.
The Local Coordination Committees said 29 people were killed Friday when security forces fired on protesters in several locations.
Gunfire was used to disperse protesters in the Daraa province town of Tafas, the observatory said.
Protesters also demonstrated in the capital, Damascus, it said.
An activist based outside Syria with a network in Latakia said security forces in al-Ramel and other areas targeted in the crackdown used loudspeakers to warn people under the age of 55 not to go to mosques.
Meanwhile, 6,000 of the 7,500 Palestinian refugees displaced by the violence in al-Ramel have been located.
Pretty scary for young children to be rushed out of their homes in that situation," said Christopher Gunness, spokesman for the U.N.
"Many people around the world were shocked by the images of unarmed refugees being shot at as they fled from their homes, amid the firing on their refugee camp," Gunness said.
