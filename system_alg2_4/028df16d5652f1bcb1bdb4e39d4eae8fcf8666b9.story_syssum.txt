The National Weather Service predicted the storm would affect the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes and the Northeast, with blizzard conditions in Minnesota and Iowa and strong winds across a portion of the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley.
The wild weather also brought strong winds to parts of the Southeast and mid-Atlantic, though that threat was over by evening.
This all came on the heels of severe storms that struck Illinois late Thursday afternoon, knocking out power, damaging buildings and spawning floods, the National Weather Service reported.
Effingham and Champaign counties in Illinois reported flooding.
He said the flooding was caused by 3 inches of rain Thursday coupled with the snow melt.
The station said trained weather spotters reported 1-inch hail and 95-mph winds.
