London (CNN) -- Hans Kristian Rausing, the son of one of the world's richest men, appeared in court Wednesday charged with "preventing the lawful and decent burial" of his wife, Eva, UK media said.
"Hans and Marit Rausing and their families are mourning the death of their son's beloved wife, Eva.
Hans Kristian Rausing was initially arrested on suspicion of murder after the discovery of his wife's body but has not been charged with that crime.
The tribute was e-mailed to reporters by a public relations firm representing the family.
His daughter eventually recovered in the 1980s and dedicated many of her efforts to helping other addicts, he said, before marrying Rausing, with whom she had four children.
"Eva would have wanted the memory of her life to be used to benefit others facing similar addiction challenges in their lives," his tribute said.
