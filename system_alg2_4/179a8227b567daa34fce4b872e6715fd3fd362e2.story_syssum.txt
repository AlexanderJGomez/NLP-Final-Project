2 executive, Sheryl Sandberg, might be worth as much as $1.6 billion.
How did she get the confidence to perform so well at such a high level?
Sandberg's own mentor, Larry Summers, ignited a firestorm in 2005 when he wondered publicly whether one reason women weren't achieving at the highest levels in the sciences was a lack of biological aptitude, particularly for math.
They lack confidence.
To assume that a lack of confidence is the reason so few women are intellectual leaders is too simplistic.
As women, in many cases, the impulse to do something out of the norm of our peer group, like write an opinion piece or ask for a promotion, has simply never occurred to us.
Why should we?
Women of various generations gather and shape their ambitions over a meal and some conversation.
We must see our peers and ourselves as leaders who have a right and a responsibility to weigh in on the matters of our day.
We can create more Sandbergs by surrounding ourselves with confident, outspoken women.
