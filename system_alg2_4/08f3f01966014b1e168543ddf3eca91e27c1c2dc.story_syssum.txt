Opinions expressed in the rapid-fire Twitter echo chamber, particularly in response to political news, are often at odds with the general public's.

Pew's research shows that Twitter users are considerably younger than the general public and more likely to lean Democratic.

In the Pew's 2012 news consumption survey, just 13% of adults said they ever use Twitter or read Twitter messages.
Only 3% said they regularly or sometimes tweet or retweet news or news headlines on Twitter.
