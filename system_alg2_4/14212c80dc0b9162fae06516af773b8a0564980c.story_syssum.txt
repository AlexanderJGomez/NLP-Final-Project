The way Mexican President Felipe Calderon answered this question when asked by New York Times reporters is creating quite a stir.
PRI congresswoman and former party president Beatriz Paredes lashed out at the president for making the statement.
"I don't consider it an appropriate statement for a head of state," said the former Tlaxcala governor.
"The president didn't say anything that hasn't been said before, particularly the permissibility, the inaction and omissions that have weakened the institutions of our country," Blake Mora said.
Asked to clarify, Rizzo told Mexican media that he was referring to agreements between the different levels of government, not the drug cartels.
Pressed on whether Calderon was accusing the PRI as a whole, Blake Mora said that "it's false that the president has accused the PRI as an institution.
he asked reporters at the press conference.
