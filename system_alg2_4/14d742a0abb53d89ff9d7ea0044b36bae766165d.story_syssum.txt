(CNN) -- A Florida grand jury this week found that two deputies in Pensacola should not be criminally charged in the wounding of an unarmed man, who was shot at 15 times while he was in his own driveway.
Middleton's attorney, Lorenzo Williams, told CNN on Wednesday that his client was distraught over the grand jury decision.
Searching for a cigarette while inside his white Lincoln Town Car, he appeared to have been mistaken for a car thief by a concerned neighbor who called 911.
"The tragedy of this is the noncompliance to the directions of law enforcement officers," Morgan said in August.
According to the investigative report, Middleton had his keys and a small flashlight in his hand.
It provided a report to the Escambia County State Attorney, which took the case to the grand jury.
In the FDLE report, Middleton allegedly told investigators that he used crack cocaine and alcohol the day before, but only drank two beers earlier on the day of the shooting.
Middleton was among those testifying before the grand jury.
Last month, District Attorney Bill Eddins told CNN, "this (case) is a little different than a typical case where a prosecutor seeks an indictment.
Morgan, in a statement released Wednesday, said his office will begin an internal investigation to determine whether there were any policy violations in the shooting.
"They have to improve their training programs," he told CNN.
