If Facebook goes ahead with its plans, this will be the last such public vote.
For the results to be binding, more than 30% of Facebook users had to participate in the vote, which was hosted on the site by a third-party app developer.

Another update would change how Facebook shares user data with companies it owns or partners with, most notably Instagram.
But unless 299 million virtual votes were somehow misplaced, the results are clear.
