(CNN) -- Dennis Rodman's flashy visit to North Korea is just a big elaborate show.
It has made hostile statements toward the United States and South Korea in reaction to the announcement of the new U.N. Security Council resolution that imposed more sanctions on the regime.
What this portrait lacks is the unimaginable level of the suffering of people inside the country who are deprived of basic human rights and food.
In 2011, Freedom House listed the regime as one of the seven worst violators of human rights in the world.
The impact of endless hunger and recurrent famine has tremendous long-lasting impact on the North Korean people.
In its November 2012 crop and food security assessment, the U.N. predicted a gap of 207,000 tons of food this year in North Korea.
The world must be careful not to be blinded by congenial games and friendly speeches coming out of North Korea.
Most importantly, such sideshows are not in the interest of the North Korean people.
