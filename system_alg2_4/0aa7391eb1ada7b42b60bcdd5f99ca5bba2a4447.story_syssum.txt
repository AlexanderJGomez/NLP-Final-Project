Hilton Hong Kong installed the world's first hotel minibar in 1974 by stocking liquors and fridges in each of its 840 rooms.
But Hilton recently started backtracking in some of its properties, removing the booze and leaving the fridges in its rooms, for guests to fill themselves.
The trend for "convenience eating" is also contributing to a decline in the traditional hotel restaurant that serves three meals a day, he says.
For those who think inflated prices on items like tiny bags of macadamia nuts and mediocre chocolate bars are offensive, especially when nearby convenience stores offer the same stuff for a fraction of the price, the stocked in-room bar has always been an irritant.
It's not what people want," he says.
"We can't just give hot and cold running water," says Dean Winter, area director of operations of Hong Kong Hotels & China Projects at Swire Hotels.
"People appreciate a complimentary minibar or Wi-Fi or movies, and paying a rate and not all these add-ons," he says.
Only corporate or high-paying guests get the fully complimentary minibar.
At Hong Kong's Ovolo Hotel, the complimentary scheme is extensive: guests get a free minibar, breakfasts, plus two-hours free booze daily at its O Lounge, including all spirits and wine.
"The competitor of the minibar isn't nearby hotels but the 24-hour stores where one can get everything you need a few blocks away," he says.
The convenience of having a cold drink in your room isn't quite enough if you have to pay three times as much for it, it seems.
