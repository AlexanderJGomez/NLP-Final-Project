"The world's amphibians are facing an uphill battle for survival," said James Collins of Arizona State University, co-chairman of the group.
"Amphibians have so much to offer humans," said amphibian specialist Simon Stuart.
Andrew Blaustein, who began documenting amphibian declines two decades ago, said the loss of species was part of an overall biodiversity crisis.
