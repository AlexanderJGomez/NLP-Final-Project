During a remarkable competitive career spanning six decades, Player won nine majors and 165 tournaments, adopting a grueling fitness and a practice regime to help underpin his game.
The day before this interview he'd hit 100 practice shots, so it's hardly surprising Player is still able to average about 70 shots per round, which is the mark he achieved during his professional career on the PGA then Seniors Tour, one of the best of all time.
"We talk about wars, the number of people dying from diabetes and cancer and heart attacks -- in comparison to the numbers killed in wars are insignificant, but nobody cares about health or exercise.

Don't dare tell Player that golf isn't a physically demanding sport.
"I tell you, walk 18 holes, it's tremendous exercise and you can play golf for a lifetime," he said.

You will overcome it," said Player.
