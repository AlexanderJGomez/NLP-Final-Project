The Gahanna-Jefferson School District began teaching Mandarin Chinese four years ago and since then, the number of students in the program has increased from about 40 to 350.
"We owe it to our students so they can be a successful part of the world," said Hank Langhals, coordinator for pupil services.
The funds will be used, school officials say, to support their visiting teacher from China and to foster the newly formed relationship with their sister school in the southern Chinese province of Kunming.
They work with more than 60 schools in the U.S.
"We feel very lucky that we have this," Aldis said.
"It's really been challenging," she said.
I think China has a beautiful culture."
"Not really often because I think most Americans are really polite," Chiwei said.
"The problem here was the culture portion and the involvement with the Chinese government."
School officials at Ohio's Gahanna-Jefferson school district maintain that is not part of their curriculum.
Parent Mandy Aldis said she isn't bothered one bit by the program being funded by China's government.
I think the more you're exposed to another culture, the more you understand each other, you're just a more well-rounded person.
