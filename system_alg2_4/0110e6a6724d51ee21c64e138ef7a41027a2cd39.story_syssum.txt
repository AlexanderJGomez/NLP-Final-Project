Greece has become an unwitting crossroads -- both for jihadists trying to reach Iraq and Syria from Europe, and for fighters returning home from the Middle East.
One source close to the Greek intelligence services told CNN there may be some 200 people in the country with links to jihadist groups such as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) or the al Nusra Front -- the two groups that most Europeans join.
-- Last year, two French jihadists were arrested after using Greek soil to return home.
One was Ibrahim Boudina, a 23-year-old French national born in Algiers.
"Greece is not a target, just a gateway into Europe and a stop on the fighters' return home," said the source close to Greek intelligence.
"We estimate that about 2,000 people have used Greece in the last two years or so, mainly arriving by boat from Italy, as a stop to an onward journey," the source close to the intelligence services told CNN.
"Given the number of people who have left Europe for Syria and the Middle East we don't regard this number as very high.
Nomikos says a few of those who arrive in Greece subsequently marry Greek women and receive Greek ID cards or passports, allowing them to travel through much of the European Union.
The Greek Interior Ministry acknowledges it has little idea of the number of people living illegally in Greece.
Nomikos also says there is inadequate coordination between the National Intelligence Service, the police and other agencies -- and that Greece badly needs help from the U.S. or European government to reform its security services.
In the wake of the Paris attacks this month, Federica Mogherini, the European Union's foreign policy chief, promised better intelligence sharing across the EU and with affected Arab states to tackle terrorism.
