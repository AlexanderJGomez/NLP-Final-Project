(CNN) -- He claimed he won the prize this week, and now it's official: Pedro Quezada of New Jersey is the winner of Saturday's $338 million Powerball jackpot, the New Jersey Lottery said Tuesday.
But the money "won't change my heart," Quezada said.
He said he was nervous Monday night.
"I never thought I would win such a prize," Quezada said.
"I don't know," he said.
"Of course, my family's a very humble family, and we're going to help each other out," he said.
Quezada said he might buy a car with part of his winnings.
"I don't know exactly how, but I will help those in need," he said.
