Howard, who premiered the follow-up in Rome, Italy, this week, said there was "residual antagonism from 'The Da Vinci Code,' " but Vatican officials ignored the movie by not responding to suggestions that the church was offended.
An Opus Dei priest who teaches history and literature at Holy Cross University in Rome said that "Angels & Demons" has "simply not been an issue" among those in the Vatican and that any controversy is a product of the movie's marketing machine.

The new movie is not as offensive, Wauck said.
"I think there's some residual antagonism from 'The Da Vinci Code,' " Howard said.
Howard said he tried to reach out to the Catholic Church.
This controversy, Wauck said, was also cooked up by the film's marketing department.
The film, which like "The Da Vinci Code" stars Tom Hanks as symbolism professor Robert Langdon, takes the audience inside the Conclave, where cardinals meet secretly to choose a new pope.
"I wanted to represent for the audience that with as much detail as I did going to the moon with 'Apollo 13,' " he said, referring to his 1995 movie about the aborted space mission.
"Angels & Demons" is the second of Brown's Langdon novels Howard has turned into a film.
Howard said he will wait to decide whether he will make a movie based on Brown's third Langdon novel.
They're going to tell us a lot."
