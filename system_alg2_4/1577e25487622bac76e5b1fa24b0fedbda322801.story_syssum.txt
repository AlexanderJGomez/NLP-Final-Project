A man stabbed nine people, including the driver of a bus and passengers on Wednesday, in what police are calling a terror attack.
The attacker was a 23-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank city of Tulkarem, authorities said.
The suspect was identified as Hamzeh Matrouk, said Israeli authorities and the suspect's family.
"Hamzeh has no political affiliation," the uncle said.
When asked what could be a motive for the suspect's attack, the uncle said it was "because of what he sees of suffering of the Palestinians by Israel.
Witnesses and police say that when the attacker boarded the bus and stabbed the driver and a few passengers, the driver tried to fight back by spraying the assailant with pepper spray, veering the bus, pumping the brakes and opening the doors.
The attacker ran after them and stabbed a few people on his way out of the bus.
Five people were either lightly or moderately injured, emergency services said.
