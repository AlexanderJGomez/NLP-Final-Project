(CNN) -- The nation's colleges have a serious rape problem.
Of the six universities where I have worked, the University of Virginia stands out among them for not only the frequency of rape allegations but also for the unresponsiveness of administrators.
One week.
When I worked there, I was once asked to meet with a student who had been found responsible for sexual assault.
I also sat through sexual assault board hearings where clear cut cases of rape occurred and supported survivors when they found out that the perpetrator was found "not responsible."
And in fact, the Office of Civil Rights for the U.S. Department of Education ordered universities in 2011 to stop mediating rape cases.
In a morally abhorrent move -- one I hope will be found illegal by the civil rights office during its investigation of the university's handling of sexual assaults -- Virginia actually offered complainants a process for an "informal resolution" that sounds just like a mediation process.
Let's remember that while recent news makes the University of Virginia seems more egregious than most institutions, a lot of students there are making a big difference -- men in the One in Four chapter and women in the One Less organization.
Furthermore, we need universities to have adjudication processes that are accessible to and trusted by students.
