Philadelphia (CNN) -- A Roman Catholic priest in Philadelphia was arrested on allegations of sexually abusing a 10-year-old boy in 1997, the city's district attorney announced Friday.
The man alleged that the abuse occurred in the church rectory and involved one incident of "sexual contact."
In December of 2011 the man reported the alleged incident to the police department's Special Victims Unit after seeing news coverage of the sexual abuse scandals at Penn State and the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, said Police Capt.
The victim hesitates because the individual is a person of authority," Darby said.
Ordained in 1982, McCormick was one 21 priests placed on administrative leave by the Archdiocese of Philadelphia in March of 2011 in response to the grand jury report.
As a result of the administrative leave, McCormick has not been permitted to exercise his public ministry, administer any of the sacraments, or present himself publicly as a priest, according to the Archdiocese of Philadelphia.
The court took away his passport and he is not allowed contact with the victim, or with children or youth involved with the ministry, volunteer work or any charities, according to the district attorney's office.
