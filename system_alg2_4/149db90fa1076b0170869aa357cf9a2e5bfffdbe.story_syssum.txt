(CNN) -- Steve Jobs wasn't eager to disclose details of his health issues over the years.
"I don't think of my life as a career," he told Time in 2010.
That's not a career -- it's a life!"
Jobs replied: "Your [sic] most welcome, James.
"Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.
He continued: "No one wants to die.
And that is as it should be, because death is very likely the single best invention of life.
The pair kept in touch, Longo recalled to the Pittsburgh Business Times, and Longo received an exuberant e-mail from Jobs after telling him the news that Longo's surgery was successful.
Even in 1995, Jobs seemed undeterred in the face of death.
I do that.
If you're going to leave anything behind, it's going toÂ be your kids, a few friends and your work.
And it's what kept me going five years ago.
It's what kept me going 10 years ago, when the doors were almost closed.
