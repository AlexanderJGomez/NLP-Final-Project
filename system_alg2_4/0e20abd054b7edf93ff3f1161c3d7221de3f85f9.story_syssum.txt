Scott County Sheriff Cody Carpenter apparently drowned in the swiftwater rescue bid, according to Keith Stephens, spokesman for the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission.
At least nine people statewide had suffered injuries as of Thursday night -- before the death in Scott County -- state emergency management spokesman Tommy Jackson told CNN.
Flooding was a problem in many places.
Wayne Joplin said.
"I've lived here since 1979, and I've never seen that much rain that quick," Joplin told CNN.
