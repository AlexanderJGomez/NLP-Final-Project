The manager of the Fort Calhoun Nuclear Power Plant and his colleagues are bent on dispelling rumors about the condition of their facility: rumors about a meltdown, about a loss of power.
So does Gary Gates, CEO of the Fort Calhoun plant.
The floodwaters at Fort Calhoun are outside the plant.
That's where it should be.
Still, there is a genuine crisis at the plant.
But outside those barriers, the water is at least 2 feet above ground level.
The transformers power internal pumps, which operate cooling systems keeping the reactor core and the spent fuel rods from overheating.
The Fort Calhoun plant has been offline since early April for a re-fueling operation.
Gates and his colleagues say the water has not breached the buildings housing the reactor core and the spent fuel rods, and they're confident it won't.
Officials did not allow journalists directly into the rooms housing the reactor core and the spent fuel rods, but did allow them to view those rooms via closed-circuit cameras.
Gates says the Nuclear Regulatory Commission cited the Fort Calhoun plant in 2009 for not being adequately prepared for a flooding event.
