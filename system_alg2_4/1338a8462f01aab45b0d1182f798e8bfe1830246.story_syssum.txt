(CNN) -- Japan won the Women's World Cup for the first time on Sunday, denying the United States a record third title after twice coming from behind in the final and then winning a penalty shootout in Germany.
Japan missed their third, but Saki Kumagai blasted the winner high into the net for an unassailable 3-1 lead to make her team the first from Asia to win the four-yearly soccer event.
But, despite their preparations being affected by the earthquake and tsunami that devastated their homeland in March, Japan qualified second in Group B with two wins from three matches.
The U.S. had last reached the final at home in 1999, winning the tournament for the second time after triumphing in the inaugural event in China eight years before then.
Wambach put the U.S. in front again in the 104th minute, collecting her fourth goal in six matches at the tournament to put her second on the alltime World Cup scoring list with 13.
Carli Lloyd skied her shot over the bar, but Hope Solo gave the Americans a chance when she saved Yuki Nagasoko's weak effort.
"We made just a couple of mistakes.
It's hard to lose on penalties, some go in and some go out.
"We have some very good players on the team and that is why we won the final.
In a shootout, I just have to believe in myself, and I was very self-confident in that situation.
"I just got the highest hopes that this great team, which has shown such resilience, will be coming back and winning for the U.S.," Clinton told reporters, adding that she plans to watch the game from Greece.
The Japanese players had won over their share of fans, with Solo of the U.S. team calling them "the sentimental favorites" for helping to lift the spirits of their devastated nation.
