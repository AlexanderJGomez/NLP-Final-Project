At a protest earlier this week, one police officer died and scores of people were injured, according to police.
You should avoid areas of demonstrations, and exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings, protests, or demonstrations," the embassy said.
The unrest came as demonstrators hoped to force Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra from office.
The national Election Commission urged the government to postpone elections.
"We urge the government to postpone the election until a joint agreement from both sides is reached."
Protest leaders have said they want to rid Thailand of the influence of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the older brother of Yingluck Shinawatra.
The current protests in Bangkok were prompted by a botched attempt by Yingluck Shinawatra's government to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for her brother's return.
