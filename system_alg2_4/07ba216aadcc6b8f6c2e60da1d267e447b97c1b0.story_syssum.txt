Many travelers don't believe there is anything wrong with leaving their personal electronic devices on while in flight, but it's a no-no during takeoffs and landings.
Using personal electronic devices below 10,000 feet is banned on most airlines.
While many airlines now offer Wi-Fi access via portable electronic devices from laptops to smartphones, cellular voice and data services on domestic airlines fall under that Federal Communications Commission ban.
The FAA has said it does not know of any aviation accidents linked to interference from personal electronic devices.
"I write to urge the FAA to enable greater use of tablets, e-readers, and other portable electronic devices during flight, consistent with public safety," FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski said in an August letter.
Delta Air Lines is also on record urging the FAA to expand the use of electronic devices in flight but to limit cell phone calls to the ground only.
The group will not discuss cell phone use in the air, which is banned by the FCC because of the potential for interference with wireless networks on the ground.
