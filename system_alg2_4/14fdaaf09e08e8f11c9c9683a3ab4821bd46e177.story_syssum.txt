Serbia is aiming to become the third country from former Yugoslavia to join Europe's political and economic union, following in the footsteps of Slovenia and neighbor Croatia, who joined earlier this year.
"These foreign investments will not happen if Serbia is not a part of the modern world," Dacic said.
Despite Serbia's ambitions, accession can be a slow process.
Although the EU never gives specific time frames on accession, Dacic is confident Serbia will join Europe's exclusive club within the next 10 years.
Dacic said: "We have always made it clear that we cannot and will not try to bring our problems to the EU with us.
William Bartlett, author of 'Europe's Troubled Region,' believes EU membership for Serbia will help ease some of the political tensions with Kosovo.
