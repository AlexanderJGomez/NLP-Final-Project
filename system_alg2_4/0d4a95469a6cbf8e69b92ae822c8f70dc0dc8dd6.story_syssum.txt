(CNN) -- Rwanda held solemn commemorations Monday to mark the 20th anniversary of the genocide in Rwanda, with many survivors overcome with emotion as they relived the trauma of the killings that left 800,000 people dead.
At a ceremony at the national stadium, survivors of the genocide recounted their memories of the killings and of their survival.
France said over the weekend that it had canceled plans to attend the ceremony after Kagame's accusations of French involvement in the massacre.
The French Foreign Ministry said that France was "surprised by the recent accusations made by the Rwandan president" and that Justice Minister Christiane Taubira, who had been due to travel to Kigali on Monday, would no longer attend the commemoration.
"When I came out, I found the people we had committed crimes against, be it the mother of this boy (Rafiki) or this boy himself," Musa said.
Musa has promised to help Rafiki find his father's body.
In 1994, Hutu extremists in Rwanda targeted minority ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus in a three-month killing spree that left an estimated 800,000 people dead.
France, an ally of the Hutu nationalist government before the 1994 killings, has repeatedly denied any complicity in the genocide.
