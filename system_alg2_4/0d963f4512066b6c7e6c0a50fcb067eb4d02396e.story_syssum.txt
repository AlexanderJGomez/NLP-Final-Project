The same jury that convicted Carla Hughes of two counts of murder Tuesday for the death of Avis Banks spared her life, declining to impose the death penalty.
Madison County District Attorney Michael Guest asked the panel of nine women and three men to sentence Hughes to death based on the gruesome nature of Banks' murder.
"She took Avis Banks' life and the life of her unborn child because she wanted that life," the prosecutor said.
"I'm not asking you, I'm pleading with you, to spare my daughter's life," said Hughes, who is also a teacher.
A key prosecution witness, Pittman told the jury he began seeing Hughes one month after finding out his girlfriend was pregnant.
The defendant's cousin testified that he lent her a knife and a loaded .38 caliber revolver the weekend before Banks' death.
She took the lives of two people in that garage," he said in his closing argument Wednesday.
... She was met by a stone-cold killer," he said.
