It's not just any truck.
The United Nations is investigating if the TEL came from China in violation of U.N. resolutions, a U.S. official tells CNN.
Charles Vick, a missile analyst for GlobalSecurity.org, points out the truck may not have been made in China.
Or China may have sold the truck to North Korea in the years before the sanctions were in place.
Cordesman said there is much we don't know about the rocket.
But North Korea's recent failed launch demonstrated that it has made little progress in developing long-range missiles, according to the director of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency.
And their progress has not been made apparent in this latest flight test."
