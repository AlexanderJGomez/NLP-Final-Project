Dallas (CNN) -- Some may disagree whether George W. Bush was a "uniter, not a divider," as he liked to say, but he did get all five living presidents together for the dedication of his presidential library.
Bush has said he is aware that the opening of his presidential library would reopen debates over the Iraq War and the policies he pursued after the September 11 terrorist attacks.
"In January of 2005, there was a peace treaty between north and south Sudan that ended a war that had been going on for 20 years," Carter said.
The last time the five living presidents were together was right before President Obama took office.
"That's what President George W. Bush chose to do," Obama said.
In an interview with CNN's John King, the former president said he knows that the center's dedication will rekindle the debate about his presidency, and he conceded the library is in part an effort by him and supporters to influence history's verdict.
"I know this: that Laura and I gave the presidency eight years of our life.
Made the best judgment calls I could.
As the son of another former president, Bush said he wouldn't mind seeing his brother Jeb Bush run for the highest office.
In addition to the library and museum, the Presidential Center includes the George W. Bush Institute, a public policy institute.
