Starting today, there will be panels called "I Can't Write, I Can't Draw, But I Love Comics!"
"The mainstream TV and film representation at Comic-Con has outstripped the original essence of the convention," said iReporter Brad Powers who attended Comic-Con the past two years, mainly for the panels on "Lost."
For one panel, Powers said he arrived a full 45 minutes before it was set to begin.
Powers is not attending the convention this year since "Lost" has ended.

"I am not one of those who believe it should remain solely in the realm of comics and their related forms of media," she said.
"Last year, at one of the studio panels, they had the Mike Judge film, 'Extract,' and people saw the footage.
It also brings in other people to the convention that otherwise wouldn't be interested," she said.
She even recalls a quite vocal reaction last year to a movie that, on the surface, would seem like a good fit.
But there are plenty of other panels, such as one for Will Ferrell's cop comedy "The Other Guys," which will ensure the debate continues.
