Chelsea suffered a shock 1-0 loss at relegation threatened Crystal Palace and hours later saw Manchester City gain a point thanks to a 1-1 draw at Arsenal.
"I think it is now impossible to win the title," Mourinho told Sky Sports before the Manchester City game.
Arsenal appeared listless, perhaps the result of losing 6-0 at Chelsea last week and then dropping more points against Swansea.
John Terry, so solid for Chelsea this season, gave Palace a valuable three points with an own goal in the 52nd minute.
Wayne Rooney -- a week after his wonder goal from the halfway mark against West Ham -- scored twice in United's 4-1 lunchtime win over Aston Villa.
Elsewhere, English trio Rickie Lambert, Jay Rodriguez and Adam Lallana shone for Southampton again in a 4-0 home win against Newcastle; and relegation contenders West Bromwich Albion and Cardiff City played to a 3-3 draw after both scored deep in injury time.
