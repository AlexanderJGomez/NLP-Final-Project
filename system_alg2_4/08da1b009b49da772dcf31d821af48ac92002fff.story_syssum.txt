But together these different perspectives strengthen our shared work both as chefs and as advocates.
Oxfam invited us to Haiti to meet some of the Haitian farmers and chefs who are planting seeds of hope in a country that has faced more obstacles than any community should rightly be expected to overcome.
But during our short visit, we saw a different Haiti.
They are working to build a stronger Haiti that can prosper and thrive.
The gardens offer the prospect of a new way to earn a living -- growing fresh, healthy food for their community.
We tasted the hope in the delicious meals we shared with young chefs who had just graduated from Haiti's Ecole Hoteliere -- their ambition and optimism the same as any chef you'd meet in New York or New Orleans or Paris.
The innovation, ingenuity and hope we saw can create the foundations of a Haiti known for its food, culture and beauty rather than its poverty.
