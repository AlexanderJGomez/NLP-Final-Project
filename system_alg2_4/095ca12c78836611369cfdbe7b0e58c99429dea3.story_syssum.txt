(CNN) -- Six people were killed and six were injured when a small plane crashed at Cork Airport in southern Ireland on Thursday, local officials said.
Flight NM7100, an inbound Manx2 airline flight, was due to land at Cork Airport at 9:45 a.m., the airport said.
Robinson called it "a terrible tragedy," and said his thoughts were "with the families of the bereaved.
My thoughts are also with those who have been injured."
Irish and British experts will be involved in the crash investigation, authorities said.
