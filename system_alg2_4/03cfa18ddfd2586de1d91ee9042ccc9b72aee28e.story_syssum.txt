Meanwhile, a video obtained by CNN casts doubt on the Border Patrol agent's claim that he was surrounded by rock-throwing suspected illegal immigrants when he fatally shot the boy on the border at Ciudad Juarez.
CNN obtained the video, which was shot by a witness on a cell phone camera from the Mexican side of the border, from affiliate Univision.
In the distance, a U.S. Border Patrol officer on a bicycle can be seen making his way toward the area.
Seconds later, two gunshots can be heard on the video.
After the shooting, another suspect is seen running in the upper left side of screen away from the incident.
She had said: "This agent, who had the second subject detained on the ground, gave verbal commands to the remaining subjects to stop and retreat.
The FBI has been studying videos of the incident and said some of the video does show rocks being thrown at the Border Patrol agents, the official said.
Belmonte said Hernandez was shot in the head.
Reports that the Mexican military may have drawn weapons on U.S. Border Patrol agents, which surfaced earlier Wednesday, could not be immediately confirmed.
"We are aware of those reports, but I cannot confirm them to you at this time," said Mexican military spokesman Enrique Torres.
Simmons told CNN earlier that she did not know whether the person who was shot was on the Mexican or U.S. side of the border, but the agent never left U.S. territory.
Peaceful protests against the U.S. Border Patrol were held in Juarez on Wednesday, near the site of the fatal shooting.
Earlier, Qualia, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman, said he could not comment because he does not know where the Mexican government obtained its statistics.
From October 1 through May 31, he said, Custom and Border Protection agents used their firearms 31 times.
