To Sony, releasing the Move is an obvious move for the PlayStation, given it believes it started the motion controller era with its Eye Toy.
Now, the Move, which will be available this fall in a starter kit that begins at under $100 for a Move, a PlayStation eye camera and a game, is its attempt to jump ahead of Microsoft's Natal and to begin winning over Wii users.
Now, by unveiling the device's name it can begin what Dille said will be the company's biggest video game marketing effort of the year.
And later this year, the forthcoming game SOCOM 4 will incorporate both Move and the sub-controller.
