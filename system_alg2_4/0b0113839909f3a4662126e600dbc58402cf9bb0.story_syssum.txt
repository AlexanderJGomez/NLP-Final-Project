After this IRS mess, who in government is going to be in a rush to take on -- or try to regulate -- the groups they should actually be looking at as political operations, overt or covert?
But in the heat of a general election, when policy is politics, how can anyone tell the difference?
To gain their tax-exempt status, they're supposed to promote the "social welfare."
Why wasn't the IRS "scrutinizing the big fish," asks Paul Ryan, the chief lawyer for the Campaign Legal Center, a watchdog group that has pushed (unsuccessfully) for the IRS to investigate these groups.
Ah, but that's exactly what happened -- and, as a result, these groups that, according to some estimates, collectively spent over $250 million on candidates during the last election are still tax-exempt.
Hmmm.
Not exactly political in any way, shape or form.
The new "perceived line," he explains, is that all these groups need to do is spend less than half of their money on politics.
So if these groups spend less than half of their money on politically related activism, the dough they collect from big corporations and donors can be used for campaign activities, all without disclosure of where the money came from.
And now, the obvious -- and perverse -- consequence of the IRS bungling: It has just made the world safer for tax lawyers.
