But events in Japan, where two of the six spent fuel pools at the Fukushima Daiichi facility were compromised, have raised questions about practices at the nation's 104 nuclear reactors, which rely on a combination of pools and dry casks to store used fuel.
Currently, there is no maximum time fuel can remain in spent fuel pools, the NRC said Wednesday.
As of January 2010, an estimated 63,000 metric tons of spent fuel was in storage at U.S. power plants or storage facilities, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
"At many sites there is nearly 10 times as much irradiated fuel in spent fuel pools as in the reactor core," he said.
"I have nothing against the quality of Sears storage sheds but they are not suitable to nuclear waste storage," he said.
Jaczko said spent fuel pools don't endanger the public.
"But we do analyze the fuel.
