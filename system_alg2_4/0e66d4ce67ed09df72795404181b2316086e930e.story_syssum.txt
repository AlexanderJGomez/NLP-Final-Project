(CNN) -- Hours after being released from jail, a man walked through an emergency door at San Diego International Airport, onto the tarmac and sat down on a United Express plane Tuesday, according to San Diego authorities.
After it was opened, the emergency door alarm sounded, and Bolduc said police were on site in four minutes, but by then Duncan had blended in with other passengers.
"They said, 'What is your count?'
"It sounds like they just have lax security or not enough management.
"The guy did breach security, but he was caught," Bolduc said.
