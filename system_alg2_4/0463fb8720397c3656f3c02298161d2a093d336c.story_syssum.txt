WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. Ted Stevens declared his innocence Tuesday after his indictment on charges that he concealed hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gifts and services from a company in his home state.

The indictment does not accuse Stevens of accepting bribes, Matt Friedrich, the acting assistant attorney general, emphasized in a news conference announcing the charges.
In the 28-page indictment, Stevens was charged with seven counts of making false statements on his Senate financial disclosure forms.
Stevens was caught by surprise Tuesday by his indictment, Sen. Daniel Inouye told CNN.
And I believe him," said Inouye, a Hawaii Democrat who is one of Stevens' closest friends in the Senate.
Allen pleaded guilty in May 2007, paying out more than $400,000 "in corrupt payments" to Alaska officials, the Department of Justice said in announcing the Stevens indictment.
Reacting to the indictment, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said it was up to Senate Republicans to decide if any punishment was warranted.
"As far as what's going to happen in the Republican caucus, that's up to them.
Sen. John Warner, a Virginia Republican, recalled that he and Stevens were veterans of World War II and that "he was a hero and a fighter, and he's been a fighter for this country since then -- a fighter for his state ever since and a strong leader in the Senate.
Another Republican, Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, said, "I have known Ted Stevens for 28 years, and I have always found him to be impeccably honest.
He is the longest-serving Republican senator in history.
