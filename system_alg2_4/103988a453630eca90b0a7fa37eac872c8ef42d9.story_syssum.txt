(CNN) -- Reigning world champions, Italy have been held to a 1-1 draw by New Zealand in their World Cup Group F match at the Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit.
Italy continued to press in the second half but found no route through a spirited and steadfast defense expertly organized by Kiwi captain Ryan Nelsen.
A win against Slovakia would ensure qualification, but they must rely on New Zealand getting a result against Paraguay to have any chance of topping their group.
"The result is 1-1 so we just have to pull up our socks and win our next game because we don't want to go home early," Lippi said, AFP reported.
In the other match in Group F, Paraguay beat Slovakia 2-0 at the Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein.
The result leaves Slovakia needing to beat Italy in their final group match this Thursday to have any chance of progressing to the next round.
Roque Santa Cruz should have doubled Paraguay's in the 38th minute, when he latched onto a loose ball on the edge of Slovakia's penalty area.
Santa Cruz turned provider in the second half, breaking down the left past Slovakia's Vladimir Weiss in the 72nd minute.
