Football or soccer?
The world body -- FIFA -- has the word "football" in its title.
Soccer would have been used to differentiate between University sports rugby football ("rugger") and "association" football.
Soccer was initially referred to as football in the United States.
In later years, it became the United States Soccer Football Association and today is known as the United States Soccer Federation.
If you are thinking that, just remember one of the most popular shows in Britain is called "Soccer Saturday", so it's not as clear cut as you may think!
