During Movember (the month formerly known as November), men around the globe grow mustaches (hence the name) while raising money for men's health issues.
Van Helden came to the United States two years ago for work and said he is just like any other guy.

He said men in general aren't good at committing to regular health screenings.
The goal is to get your friends to donate money to your Movember cause, which is then donated to the Prostate Cancer Foundation, LiveStrong and other men's health research and awareness programs.
According to the American Cancer Society, one in every six men will get prostate cancer during his lifetime, and one in every 36 will die from the disease.
Every second guy has a mustache.
Here, not so much."
Like most men, he recognizes that he doesn't go for health screenings as often as he should.
Van Helden went as Sherlock Holmes last year-- complete with tweed and his pants tucked into his socks.
You're all there for a good cause."
All jokes aside, the American Mustache Institute and Movember hope to raise awareness about an often less thought about issue, men's health.
