While it is considered a delicacy in Japan and some other countries, meat from whale -- an endangered species -- cannot be sold legally in the United States.
The investigation began in October when two members of the team that made "The Cove" visited The Hump, officials said.
Armed with a hidden camera, the two women captured the waitress serving them whale and horse meat and identifying them as such, a federal criminal complaint said.
He identified the whale sample to be that of sei whale, prosecutors said.
A DNA test of the meat smuggled out after the February visit confirmed it to be meat from the sei whale, Mrozek said.
The next, officials raided the restaurant and chef Yamamoto admitted that he had served whale meat, the complaint said.
Whaling is allowed under international law when done for scientific reasons, which Japan cites as the legal basis for its hunts.
The country's annual hunt kills up to 1,000 whales a year.
