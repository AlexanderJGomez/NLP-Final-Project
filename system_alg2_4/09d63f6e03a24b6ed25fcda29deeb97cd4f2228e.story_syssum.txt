Sony, makers of the top-selling PlayStation 4, has rolled out "Project Morpheus," a virtual reality system it says will pair with its top-selling gaming console to immerse players in the virtual worlds in which they're playing.
Morpheus will feature a visor-style headset and interact with the camera on the Playstation 4 using sensors that track the player's head movements.
That sort of 360-degree immersion has never been done in a believable manner in the past, but the technology has caught up.
It all raises the question of whether top-tier game developers will be willing to make the considerable investment of time and resources it will take to create games for a new, untested system that will only be owned by some gamers who own one particular console.
"But because Project Morpheus is essentially a new platform on its own, there will be plenty of developers who will want to be first or early on it.
Don't count on it.
"Oculus is still in a great position with its head start in development, both in hardware and software," Hsu said.
"Third-party games have been in the works for the Oculus Rift for quite some time now, so the company is in a good spot for when the headset releases."
