I should have expected that Dr. Oz would keep standing in the face of charges from a group of colleagues that he pushed "quack treatments ... for personal financial gain."
But he's increasingly serving himself at a cost to Columbia University and New York Presbyterian Hospital.
Despite his utter humiliation, Dr. Oz soldiered on, with his university and hospital continuing to stand by him, and with Harpo Productions and Sony, who co-produce "The Dr. Oz Show," fully behind his program.
The doctors insisted that the university must disassociate itself from Dr. Oz for his now well-established tendency to promote cure-alls more befitting 1915 than 2015.
