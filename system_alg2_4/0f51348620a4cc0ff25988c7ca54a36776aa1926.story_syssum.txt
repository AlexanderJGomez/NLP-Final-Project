It was a typical African rural scene, but with a difference: traditionally the driver would have been a white Afrikaans male farmer, but Bohitile is a black woman.
"The percentage of black farmers is still very small in comparison to white farmers," said Bohitile.
Bohitile is making a success of her venture, but she is former Deputy Minister of Education and a prominent businesswoman today, which gave her access to capital and a head start.
Some assistance came last month when a white Namibian mentor, sponsored by German money and directed by the government-owned Agricultural Bank of Namibia arrived to advise one of the new owners, Naftali Katjiuongua.
We need more help from the government."
There seemed to be no way out of the conflict between white and black over who should rule the land and own the wealth.
"The war for talent is an ongoing challenge," she says.
Bohitile and Zaamwani-Kamwi are two women who encapsulate the new Namibia, and the possibilities open to them today were virtually unimaginable in the past.
There remains a strong sense of shared identity among Namibians of all races, and a common belief that their future can be better.
