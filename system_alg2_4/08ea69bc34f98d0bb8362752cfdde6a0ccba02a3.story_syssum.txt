Florence, Italy (CNN) -- The captain of the shipwrecked cruise liner Costa Concordia faced a closed-door hearing Monday over whether he should remain under house arrest.
Prosecutors want Schettino's house arrest revoked and the captain sent back to jail to await trial.
"...
"There isn't a speed limit," he said.
According to the transcript, Schettino said he ran the ship aground to keep it from sinking.
But in statements made during a phone conversation with a friend, Schettino said managers pressured him to steer the ship to the area where the collision occurred, two Italian newspapers reported Wednesday.
The information should not have been published, he said, as it is part of the investigation.
Costa cannot conduct an independent investigation because prosecutors seized the ship's data recorder.
In the transcript, Schettino also described the chaos, saying that he helped passengers onto lifeboats and that some became stuck because of the angle of the listing ship.
However, in the wiretapped conversation, Schettino told the friend, "When I understood that the ship was tilting, I decided to leave, and left," according to Corriere della Sera.
A captain's leaving the ship with passengers still aboard is difficult to defend, said Italian criminal defense attorney Ugo Meucci, who does not represent Schettino.
