(CNN) -- After 25 years, Robin Thomas had just about lost hope.
Recently, Wolf was featured in a fundraising video created by Rob Bliss for Dégagé Ministries.
Thomas says Wolf has started on that path before.
Thomas says Wolf trained to deploy with an infantry unit but never deployed.
About 13% of the adult homeless population are veterans.
Neither Thomas nor Bliss seemed surprised or anxious when Wolf was arrested shortly after the video was released.
When speaking of her brother, she seems quiet, respectful and a bit sad.
She knows he is not the same big brother who was there for her growing up.
Wolf was recently interviewed for a spot at a long-term residential treatment facility and received a complete physical, Thomas said.
He did not view it as a life-changing event, Thomas says.
I think he's hopeless.
Talk to them.
"I may have almost lost hope, but I will never give up."
