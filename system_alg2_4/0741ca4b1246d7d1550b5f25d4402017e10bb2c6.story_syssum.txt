For a company that hasn't attended CES since 1992, Apple dominates the show.
And then there's the sea of bedazzled and bedecked iPhone and iPad cases.
"We know that Apple is doing well," said Howard Cheng, Just Mobile's director of operations.
"Accessory makers can reach virtually the entire installed base of iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch owners with two products, determined by the connector," the 30 pin or Lightning, said Charles Govin, an industry analyst with Forrester.
"Apple owners have a demonstrated willingness to spend for accessories, cases, and other customizations," Govin said.
There's iLounge, iBattz, iSkin, iConnectivity, iPort and even iCat all within a few feet of each other on the show floor.
In the three years since the iLounge Pavilion launched, the space has quadrupled to 120,000 square feet, all but taking over an entire hall and pushing the automotive industry into another space.
Meng said that it doesn't matter that Apple isn't at CES with a booth or keynote, because CES is already the most successful and popular show for companies like his.
Just Mobile already has eight products in the Apple Store and uses CES to expand into the international market and meet clients.
With Microsoft dropping out, CES is losing even more of its sizzle.
But the fact remains that Apple and its products are the widely seen, and discussed, at CES.
"They have employees that attend the show, so in that way, Apple sort of is here," Cassognal said.
