Boston (CNN)The death penalty trial of accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev -- long delayed by painstaking jury selection, crippling snowstorms and last-ditch appeals to move the case someplace else -- is on track to get underway here next week.
The jurors first will decide whether Tsarnaev is guilty of using weapons of mass destruction to kill people at a large public event.
Many said they thought Tsarnaev was guilty of the April 15, 2013, bombings, which killed three people near the finish line.
Tsarnaev also is charged in the April 19, 2013, death of MIT police officer Sean Collier.
Opening statements and the first witnesses originally were slated for January 26, but it took longer that anticipated to question the prospective jurors for this high-profile case.
But this case is being tried in federal court, and 17 of the 30 counts against Tsarnaev include the death penalty as a possible punishment.
It is almost certain that the trial, which will include wrenching testimony and video footage of the bombing victims, will be well underway during the running of this year's Boston Marathon on April 20.
Tamerlan Tsarnaev died during a gun battle with police, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hours later, bleeding and hiding in a boat in a Watertown backyard.
