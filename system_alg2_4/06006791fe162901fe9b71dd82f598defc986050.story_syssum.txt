She was a rare breed: stunningly beautiful, immediately accessible, witty, charming and endearingly mischievous -- she was one in a million.
If the assumptions are correct, she will be the first Princess of Cambridge born into the royal family in 182 years.
In a recent Today Show poll, 32% of Americans predicted the name was a shoo-in, and in the UK the bookies' odds of a baby named after her late grandmother change almost daily as Diana becomes an increasingly popular choice.
Contrary to popular belief the Queen was very fond of Diana, but should her name be bestowed as a first name upon the baby, it would be perceived as a slap in the face to the monarchy.
Out of respect to the Queen, Charles, Camilla and the baby herself the couple simply wouldn't do it.
Since Diana's death almost 18 years ago, William has honored his mother's memory in a private and personal fashion.
I still miss Diana.
She was a one-off, and I don't believe the world will ever witness another quite like her.
She would want her to go out into the world, to make her own mark and help those less fortunate, to enrich the lives of others and to carve out her own unique identity -- as Alice, Elizabeth, Victoria, Charlotte, or -- my own personal pick -- Alexandra.
