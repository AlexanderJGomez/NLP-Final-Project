Among 2013 films, Man of Steel had the second best debut of the year behind Iron Man 3, which started with $174.1 million in May.
Audiences were 56 percent male and 44 percent female, a more even gender distribution than Iron Man 3, which had a 61/39 percent male/female split on opening weekend.
Man of Steel also clobbered the debut of 2006â€²s Superman Returns, which opened with $52.5 million and earned $200 million domestically against a $270 million budget.
In about one week, Man of Steel will likely have surpassed that film's domestic total.
Internationally, Man of Steel soared with $71.6 million in its first weekend, including $17.6 million in the United Kingdom and $9.8 million in Mexico.
In second place, This is the End opened with $20.5 million, giving the raunchy R-rated comedy $32.8 million total since its Wednesday debut.
Thanks to great reviews and strong word-of-mouth (the film earned a fair "B+" CinemaScore, but the polling service rarely favors edgy content), This is the End may find legs at the box office and could become a $100 million hit.
The $160 million Universal release has now earned $219.6 million total, surpassing Fast Five's $209.8 million cume and making it the highest grossing Fast film domestically.
