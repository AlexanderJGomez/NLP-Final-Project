(CNN) -- A Florida exterminator and father of four children adopted from Florida's foster care system has told police that a body found in the pest-control truck he was driving is one of them -- his 10-year-old daughter, authorities said Wednesday.
After Barahona and his son were taken to a hospital, a worker decontaminating the truck discovered the body of the girl, wrapped in a plastic bag, the document said.
Barahona said he didn't go through with his suicide plan because his son was with him, the document added.
Barahona told police that he doused himself with gasoline and inadvertently got some on the boy, Police Capt.
But, she added, the man's story doesn't add up -- there was no gasoline on the boy.
Olsen said police would decide how to charge Barahona further once the autopsy on his daughter determines her cause of death.
The caller to the child protection hotline in the latest case reported that the twins were routinely locked in a bathroom for long periods of time and had been bound with tape, the court heard.
The story was corroborated by interviews with the other two children in the home, officials said in court.
However, a spokesman for the department, John Harrell, said it is the job of investigators to follow through immediately or refer to someone else in the department to follow through when a matter is urgent.
