Most comets are in the outer part of our solar system.
But some observers on Tuesday reported online that the comet is not nearly as bright as it has been in recent days and that it may be pouring out dust.
"I believe the next couple of days will be crucial to determine the post-perihelion appearance of the comet," Yanamandra-Fisher said.
Whatever its final fate, she said, ISON has "provided a wonderful window into the world of comets.
Confusion about its fate isn't new for ISON watchers.
The glare of the sun has blocked most ground-based observations, but NASA has a fleet of spacecraft watching as ISON plunges toward the sun.
"I am excited at marking the progress of this comet that has captivated the world from its discovery and the possibility of it being a Great Comet," Yanamandra-Fisher told CNN.com.
"I am glad that I was able to be part of its journey."
