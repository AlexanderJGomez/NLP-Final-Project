Over the last week, thousands seeking free medical care have turned up at the mobile health care clinic set up by Remote Area Medical, a non-profit organization founded by Brock.
Tuesday marks the final day of its eight-day operation in Los Angeles, which so far has resulted in the provision of at least $2 million in free health care services, according to Brock's early estimates.
On the final day of the Los Angeles operation, Brock said crowds were still gathering with the hope of receiving care.
RAM has had to turn away some patients because it didn't have enough volunteers to provide treatment.
While limited access to health care is often associated with developing countries, it's a problem that faces patients around the world.
"We could have come to Los Angeles 15 years ago and I guarantee there would have been just as big of a turnout of patients," he told CNN.
RAM usually provides services in the Appalachia region of the U.S. where it's easier for volunteers to work, Brock said.
Unfortunately, he said, other states don't have similar provisions, making it difficult for RAM to recruit enough local volunteers to be able to deal with the demand if they were to set up in areas like New York or Washington.
