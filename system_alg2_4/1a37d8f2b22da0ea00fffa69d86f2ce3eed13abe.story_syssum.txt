French for "fat liver," this delicacy comes from ducks and geese that are fed massive amounts of food in the last weeks of their life.
Anti-foie gras activists call the process cruel.
It's easy to say that we don't need a meat organ to survive or to live.
Only three farms in the United States produce foie gras.
D'Artagnan gets its foie gras from Hudson Valley Foie Gras, two hours north of New York City, which produces about 375,000 pounds of the delicacy a year.
"The idea that you can produce the products that we produce -- that are a delicacy -- by mistreating animals is just completely, it's inconceivable," Henley says.
Still, protesters call the process a travesty.
"When we force-feed ducks and geese and we stop the force-feeding, the liver recesses to normal," Daguin says.
"The key will be both banning the sale and getting restaurants to just remove it voluntarily and not sell it," Pease said.
But foie gras producers say they're being targeted by people whose ultimate goal is a meat-free world.
There is no 'good' farm for activists."
Chef Dan Barber, inspired by the work of a Spanish foie gras producer, Eduardo Sousa, has begun experimenting with  "ethical foie gras,"  harvested from geese allowed to roam Stone Barns Center in Pocantico Hills, New York., foraging for food, according to their natural feeding cycles.
