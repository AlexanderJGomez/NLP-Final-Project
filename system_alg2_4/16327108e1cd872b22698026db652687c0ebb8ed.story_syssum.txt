Living with limb loss requires a certain toughness.
It is Chenoweth's mission to let every person who has lost a limb know they are not alone.
By 2011, Chenoweth had been dealing with her own limb loss for nearly eight years.
There is also a Facebook contest for people to share pictures of themselves in public with the absence of their limbs evident.
"I was astounded that so many people aren't living their lives out of fear of what other people are going to think," she says.
The journey toward public exposure can be terrifying, but both experts and members of the community agree on its importance in the process of seeing one's self as whole again.
The 41-year-old registered dietitian lost her leg (and the family dog) four years ago in a car accident 90 miles from her home in Las Vegas.
It was such a sweet moment, explaining to a group of 3- and 4-year-olds what happened to my leg.
"I don't see it as being ashamed of my leg," she says.
Over the past two years, Strut Your Stuff has inspired people to go out in their community for the first time without a cosmetic cover, reveal to co-workers that they're living with a prosthetic, or even leave the confines of their own homes, which they hadn't done since their limb loss.
But she says the acceptance of her limb loss came about without fanfare one day when she realized what she had been missing.
(She lost her arm below the elbow in a car accident and opts not to wear a prosthetic.)
• If you do get positive feedback, put that in your self esteem bank for later when you might be having a difficult time.
• It is natural to feel repulsed upon first seeing the absence of a limb, even when it's a loved one or romantic partner.
Peggy Chenoweth has some advice for those who may have questions for people with limb loss.
• Don't conduct the Spanish Inquisition.
• Don't tell them what they "should" be doing.
Are you or someone you love dealing with limb loss?
