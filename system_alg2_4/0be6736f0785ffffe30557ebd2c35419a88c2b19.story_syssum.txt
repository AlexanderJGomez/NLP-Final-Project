Life did not go as Fukushima expected.
60-year-old Fukushima is one of Japan's most powerful executives, sitting on the board of both U.S. and Japanese-based multi-national companies.
An American mentor and her supportive husband urged Fukushima to push beyond her Japanese cultural expectations.
Part of the reason for the low ranking is that just 1.4 percent of Japanese executives are women.
"I think we have an opportunity to change the conversation here.
I think gender diversity is a big part of the solution."
"Experimenting is the best way to say it," said Fukushima, describing Japan's corporate sentiment toward women.
Fukushima's new colleague, Bridgestone Americas, Inc. CEO and President Gary Garfield, said he is encouraged that his company in Japan is catching up to other global companies.
They'll be stronger for it.
