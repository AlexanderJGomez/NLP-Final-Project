(CNN)  -- Actress Natasha Richardson was hospitalized after she fell on a ski slope at a Quebec resort, a resort spokeswoman said in a statement Tuesday.
At the time, Richardson was accompanied by a veteran female ski instructor, who called the ski patrol, the statement said.
"As standard protocol, the ski patrol insisted that Ms. Richardson be transported to the base of the hill in a rescue toboggan," the resort statement said.
She won a Tony award in 1998 for her performance as Sally Bowles in "Cabaret."
The Montreal Gazette reported that Richardson's two sons with Neeson were skiing with her at the time of her fall, and that Neeson flew to Montreal from a Toronto film set to be with her at the hospital.
