If either proposal is adopted, people suffering from a chronic illness or who have a mental illness could no longer legally take advantage of assisted suicide.
Dan James, a 23-year-old British rugby player, ended his life at a Swiss assisted suicide clinic last year.
Multiple sclerosis sufferer Debbie Purdy won a high-profile battle in June to have Britain's law on assisted suicide clarified.
Purdy, who has said she wants the option of assisted suicide if her condition deteriorates, wanted to know at what point her husband might be prosecuted if he accompanied her to an assisted suicide clinic.
At least 117 Britons have traveled abroad for an assisted suicide since 2002, at an average of two a month, according to Dignity in Dying, which advocates giving terminally ill adults the option of assisted suicide.
It would also make assisted suicide an option only for those suffering from a terminal illness -- not for those suffering from a chronic or mental illness.
"This provision ensures that those assisting a suicide are not driven by personal gain, and that their prime motivation is to help the person who wishes to die," the council says.
The council says it prefers stricter legislation for assisted suicide, but it is also giving Parliament a second option for a complete ban on organized assisted suicide.
"This proposal seeks to address this balance."
