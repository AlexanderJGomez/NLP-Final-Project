(CNN) -- A federal judge Friday ruled in favor of a former UCLA college basketball star who sued to end the NCAA's control over the rights to college athletes' names, images and likenesses.
"Before the court in this case is only whether the NCAA violates antitrust law by agreeing with its member schools to restrain their ability to compensate Division I men's basketball and FBS football players any more than the current association rules allow," Wilken wrote.
NCAA chief legal officer Donald Remy said: "We disagree with the court's decision that NCAA rules violate antitrust laws.
Ramogi Huma, president of the National College Players Association, said the ruling was "a big win" that signaled "the time for college athletes to get their due," though he was critical of the $5,000 compensation cap.
"The ruling says the NCAA was operating illegally and college athletes do have rights," said Huma, who helped find players to join the case.
Vacarro called the decision his most important career accomplishment.
The judge wrote that the injunction will not affect student-athletes who enroll in college before July 1, 2016.
Already the issues brought up in the case have had an effect, even before the ruling was made.
Instead, Texas A&M will sell the number 12 jersey, in keeping with its 12th man tradition; and Arizona will sell jerseys with numbers that correspond to the year of competition -- 14 for this year, according to a school spokesman.
