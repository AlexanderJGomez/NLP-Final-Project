The PKK accuses Turkey of oppressing Kurdish culture and suppressing Kurdish nationhood.
Iraq, Iran and Syria also have sizeable Kurdish minorities.
By then the group's founder, Abdullah Ocalan, was living in exile in Syria where he organized PKK training camps.
In 1998, under intensive Turkish pressure, Syria expelled Ocalan and shut down the PKK camps he had established there.
It accuses the PKK of launching attacks on Turkish targets from secret bases in the mountainous and semi-autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq.
But following the deaths of 27 soldiers and 12 civilians in recent attacks, Turkish military leaders have urged the government to give them the green light to strike at PKK bases inside Iraq.
