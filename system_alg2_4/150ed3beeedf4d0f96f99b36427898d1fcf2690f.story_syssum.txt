"A panic attack gripped me and prevented me from going because I thought no woman should go through this," said the 29-year-old.
In a recent mass demonstration on January 25, for example, 25 sexual assaults were reported on women in the square.
While the group consisted of men and women, Bahgat said it was generally men who intervened when an assault was detected, to prevent women bodyguards from being sexually assaulted themselves.
He became involved in the group after being haunted by the memory of witnessing men in the crowd assaulting a woman in the square in November.
At first I thought they were catching a thief or there was a fight," he told CNN.
The group has quickly learned what works in breaking up the assaults, he said.
Then I turned around and gave her my back to climb on to.
Sexual harassment is a longstanding problem in Egypt, said Bahgat.
But Bahgat said her focus was not speculating on the causes of the attacks, but stopping them.
Many Egyptians were worried the assaults were casting their country in a bad light, she said.
The true Egyptians are the men who volunteer with us and get emotionally involved in getting women out of these situations."
