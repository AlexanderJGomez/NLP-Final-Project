Suzan Lakhan Baptiste's efforts have turned a beach from a leatherback turtle graveyard to a nesting colony.
Today, she and her group are succeeding: What was once a turtle graveyard is now a maternity ward -- one of the largest leatherback nesting colonies in the world.
It hasn't been an easy fight for Baptiste or the turtles.
"Leatherbacks [are] very vulnerable," Baptiste said.
By the 1980s, nearly one in three turtles that nested on Matura Beach were killed.
For years, Baptiste and her group patrolled the beaches every night of turtle nesting season.
Leatherbacks were a vital source of income for some members of her village, and the poachers who prowled the beaches with machetes could be threatening.
"I wanted to show that a turtle is [worth] so much more to us alive than dead," Baptiste said.
"Here, turtle slaughter is a thing of the past," Baptiste proclaimed.

The group's work is often cited as one of the most successful eco-tourism efforts in the Caribbean.

"When I got started, a lot of people thought I was crazy," Baptiste said, and she admits that she sometimes wondered if they were right.
"Crazy with a passion, crazy with a dream -- totally environmentally crazy."
