Montevideo, Uruguay (CNN) -- The passage of a landmark marijuana legalization measure Tuesday means Uruguay is set to become the first country in the world to have a system regulating legal production, sale and consumption of the drug.
It places the South American country at the vanguard of liberal drug policies, surpassing even the Netherlands, where recreational drugs are illegal but a policy of tolerance is in place.
"It is understood that a regulation-based policy has positive consequences for health and public security, given that, on the one hand, it can produce better results when it comes to education, prevention, information, treatment and rehabilitation in relation to the problematic uses of drugs," said Sen. Roberto Conde of Uruguay's Broad Front coalition, which supported the measure.
He told CNN en EspaÃ±ol last year that he supported legalizing marijuana.
Conservative critics of the measure have said it promotes drug addiction and have suggested that Mujica's comments were uninformed.
Once the bill becomes law, there will be a 120-day period to give the government time to adopt regulations and implement it.
The same debates about marijuana that exist in the United States -- about medicinal properties, recreational use, the impact on the justice system -- have been happening in Uruguay for a long time, Calzada said.
In a July poll from CIFRA/Gonzalez, Raga and Associates, 63% of Uruguayan respondents said they disagreed with the bill.
"It's a very bad piece of legislation, mainly because it increases the availability of marijuana in the market," he said.
The legislation also calls for mandatory classes in public schools aimed at drug prevention and bans the advertising of cannabis in any form.
