How has life changed for new dad Marc Lesser?
As even Prince William demonstrated in a recent interview with CNN, his first since the birth of his son George, modern dads are more and more involved and wouldn't have it any other way.
"I just thought I don't know if I am going to be any good at this," he said in between yawns.
Lesser, worried his son might stop breathing, did something I actually still do (even though my kids are 5 and 7!
Mom' is outdated
The founder of a video production company called Lucky Tiger Productions (we worked together previously during my time at iVillage.com), Lesser said the pressure of providing for a new family can be overwhelming and lead to lots of questions.
Some new fathers are a bit more freewheeling.
Shankman said he wasn't worried at all about going solo, and bases his confidence on the logic that kids have been surviving for years without their parents' sterilizing bottles and everything else.
"There is something to be said for having a dad who is a complete geek," he joked.
"My dad never changed my diaper, I don't think, and never really did much of the housework to help Mom out," said Mathers.
Lesser said that when older family friends come to visit, he thinks they're probably a bit surprised.
With everything dads are doing now, I wondered if we give them enough credit -- we being society in general, moms, media, etc.
he said.
In his interview with CNN, Prince William said a lot of things affect him differently now that he's a dad, and all the fathers I spoke with could completely relate.
He and his wife used to enjoy a date night every Friday but that went away when Willow was born.
