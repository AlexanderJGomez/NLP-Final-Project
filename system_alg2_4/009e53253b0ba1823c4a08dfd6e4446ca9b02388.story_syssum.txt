And, I would suggest, she should have gone further: There's reason to think that bombing is exactly what ISIS wants us to do.
The most recent ISIS propaganda video was produced in English for a reason.
Why?
Longtime defense analyst Kenneth Brower made a similar point: "A YouTube video of a beheading forces the U.S. president to go to 'war' in order to avoid being called weak by his domestic political opposition.
Then ISIS goaded Jordan with a video of the hideous immolation of a Jordanian pilot.
Now ISIS has just goaded Egypt with a mass execution ... and Egypt has, predictably, responded.
Why would ISIS goad the world to attack it?
Effective counterterrorism strategy begins with not doing what the terrorists want us to do.
But right now, we are the dog being wagged by the tail of ISIS.
The leadership of ISIS may do abhorrent things because of a crazy adherence to an apocalyptic interpretation of Islam, as Graeme Wood has just written in The Atlantic.
This is not to say there's no military solution to ISIS, though many experts such as Brower certainly doubt that such tactics will work.
We have to stop responding with bombs every time they provoke us with videotaped slayings.
In fact, if you think the only way to defeat them is with bombing, they've already won.
