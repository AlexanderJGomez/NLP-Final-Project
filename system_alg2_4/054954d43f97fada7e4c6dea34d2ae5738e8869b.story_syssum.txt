Beleaguered Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, sitting alongside Iran's intelligence chief, proclaimed Tuesday "the determination of the people and government of Syria to cleanse the country of terrorists."
It's a familiar theme for the Iranians, who have cast events in Syria as part of a much broader ideological battle.
That information would make clear that Iran is increasingly likely to lose its only ally in the region, greatly reducing its strategic reach," he says.
Iran is al-Assad's last regional ally, and Western intelligence officials believe the Islamic Republic has provided technical help such as intelligence, communications and advice on crowd control and weapons as protest in Syria has morphed into resistance.
"Some retired individuals from the (Revolutionary) Guards and army were dispatched to Syria to make a pilgrimage," Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi told the official Iranian news agency, a statement that will likely be seized upon by the rebels as confirmation that Iran is directly aiding the al-Assad regime.
Not so long ago, Iran and Turkey were on good terms.
Not any more.
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi traveled to Turkey Tuesday in an effort to mend that fence.
And it is likely to be a Syria where central control is much weaker in the face of sectarian and clan fissures.
Turkey will be working for the opposite outcome, wary that Syria's Kurds might seek common cause with its own restive Kurdish minority and concerned that prolonged instability will spill into Lebanon and across Syria's long and porous border with Turkey.
The United States says Iran is intensifying its support for the Assad regime.
Iranian intelligence chief Jalili met Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah before going to Damascus.
He said last month that the four senior Syrian officials killed in a bomb blast in Damascus were "martyrs" and boasted that the rockets Hezbollah had fired at Israel in 2006 were made in Syria.
