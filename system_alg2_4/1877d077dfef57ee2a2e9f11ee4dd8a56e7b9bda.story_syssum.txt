(CNN) -- While the coastal town of Savannah, Georgia, fills with spectators on Saturday for the Rock 'n' Roll marathon, Chris Fenton and Laura Devrieze will be focused on the finish line.
Fenton and Devrieze are a part of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society's Team in Training program.
His sister had called from Manhattan.
Something was wrong.
His mom, Barbara, is the matriarch of the Fenton family.
Treatment was hard.
He's running 10 marathons (to celebrate her 10th anniversary of going into remission) in six months -- the time it took from diagnosis to remission.
He has raised close to $100,000 over the last 10 years and hopes to continue supporting blood cancer research with Team in Training.
People loved Harry Devrieze.
It was from him that she learned plumbing, drywall and her way around the Home Depot store.
It was during this time that she went to her first Team in Training meeting and signed up for the Rock 'n' Roll marathon.
"It was always important for him for me to be involved and kind of have a cause," Devrieze says.
On Saturdays, Devrieze joined Team in Training in Atlanta for a run and then went to visit him.
For a couple of weeks, Devrieze refused to run, clutching to the friends and family Harry had held so close.
That's why she's all the more determined to do exactly that.
It's mind over body, and having a greater purpose ... makes the mind part work better."
