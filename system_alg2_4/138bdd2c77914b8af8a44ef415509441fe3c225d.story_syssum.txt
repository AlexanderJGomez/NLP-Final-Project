This weekend, the film notched yet another impressive achievement: it climbed to number one with an estimated $12.4 million (a 25 percent drop) in its third frame, becoming the first film since "True Grit" to hop to first place in its third weekend.
("The Town," which opened higher "Argo" with $23.8 million, fell 38 percent to $9.7 million in its third weekend.)
With $130.4 million total, Hotel is already Sony Pictures Animation's highest grossing film ever, above Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, which grossed $124.9 million in 2009.
Audiences, which were 77 percent above the age of 25, issued the film a "C+" CinemaScore.
"Cloud Atlas" cost a whopping $100 million, and it has no chance of making that money back — at least not in the States.
After ten days, Paramount's $5 million found footage sequel has earned $42.6 million, which is still $10 million less than PA3 grossed in its first weekend.
"Taken 2" took fifth place, sliding 40 percent to $8.0 million, which gives Fox's $45 million action thriller a $117.4 million total.

The original "Silent Hill" surprised analysts with a strong $20.2 million debut in 2006, but it clearly didn't leave enough of an impression on audiences for them to show up for a sequel six years later.
The $14 million film garnered a "B" CinemaScore grade from crowds, which were 67 percent female and 61 percent below the age of 18.
The film grossed $77.7 million from 25 territories, including $32.4 million from the U.K. (where the film set a new attendance record on Saturday), $9.1 million from France, and $8.6 million from Russia.
