London (CNN) -- Police in London were on Friday questioning a suspected rogue trader arrested after Swiss banking giant UBS discovered an estimated $2 billion worth of unauthorised deals.
A $2 billion rogue trading loss would be all but unprecedented, market analyst Ralph Silva told CNN.
Adoboli's job would have been to hedge, or reduce, the bank's risk on the silver and franc positions by buying and selling each.
Its review of UBS will focus on "ongoing weaknesses in the group's risk management and controls" as revealed by the reported loss, Moody's said in a statement.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is attending a meeting of Europe's Economic and Financial Affairs Council in Wroclaw, Poland, on Friday, at which questions around Greek debt and financial stability in the eurozone are bound to be discussed.
The European Central Bank, along with the Fed, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank, said three U.S. dollar auctions would be held to help out European banks that need the currency to fund loans and repay debt.
Finance ministers for the European Union member states, central bank presidents and representatives of other major financial bodies will also be present.
"Trading has been incredibly difficult over the last year," said van Dam.
But the "unauthorized trading by a trader in its investment bank" could cause UBS to post a loss in the third quarter of this year, it said.
Rogue trader Jerome Kerviel cost his French bank, Societe Generale, almost $6 billion, and was sentenced to three years in prison last year.
"The banks are too large," van Dam said.
