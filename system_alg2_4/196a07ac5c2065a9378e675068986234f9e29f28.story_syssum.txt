But there's nothing like the Holy Grail.
About 1,500 of the more than 2,200 people aboard the Titanic died.

He vanished on July 30, 1975, after he stood outside the Machus Red Fox restaurant in Michigan and made a phone call.

The disappearance of Flight 370 has nothing on the Bermuda Triangle.
"The U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard contend that there are no supernatural explanations for disasters at sea.
Call them aliens.
Call them what you want.
