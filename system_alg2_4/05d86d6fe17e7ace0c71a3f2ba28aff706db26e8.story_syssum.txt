(CNN) -- Protesters took to St. Louis streets for a second night Thursday after an off-duty officer killed a teen who fired at him three times, authorities said.
One officer suffered minor injuries and two police cruisers were damaged, Jackson said.
Protesters also burned at least one American flag, CNN affiliate KSDK reported.
Twitter user PontifexMonty said "people really getting mad that they're burning the flag in St. Louis.
Police said the teen fired a pistol three times at an off-duty St. Louis officer who was wearing his uniform while moonlighting for a security company.
One big difference: Police said Brown was unarmed.
A 9 mm pistol allegedly fired by Myers was found at the scene, police said.
While on patrol, the officer saw three men run away as he approached, Dotson said.
The officer tussled with one teen, who ran off, then turned around and fired at least three shots toward him, Dotson said.
