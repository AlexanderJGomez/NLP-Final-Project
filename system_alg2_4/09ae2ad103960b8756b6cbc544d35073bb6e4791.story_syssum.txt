(CNN) -- Violence in the United States is not related to illegal Mexican immigrants, but violence in Mexico is connected to vast shipments of weapons from the United States, Mexico's foreign minister told CNN Thursday.
In contrast, Espinosa said, there's no evidence linking high crime rates with illegal immigration, as some U.S. politicians have contended.
"Border violence and crime due to illegal immigration are critically important issues to the people of our state," Arizona Gov.
But statistics from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency and the FBI indicate that both the number of illegal crossers and violent crime have decreased recently.
According to the FBI, violent crimes reported in Arizona dropped by nearly 1,500 incidents between 2005 and 2008.
Mexican officials, from President Felipe Calderon on down, took exception to that characterization.
"In Mexico," she said, "the situation is very different.
Espinosa said some governments in Central America have gotten weaker or don't have the technological capabilities to fight crime, and the drug cartels have taken advantage.
