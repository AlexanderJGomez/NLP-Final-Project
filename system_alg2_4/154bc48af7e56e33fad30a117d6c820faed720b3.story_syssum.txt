Baghdad (CNN) -- At least five people were injured when bodyguards for a top Iraqi official opened fire on stone-throwing Sunni demonstrators Sunday, the country's interior ministry said.
Protesters chanted, "Leave!
Details about the other injuries were not immediately clear.
The arrest of a group of bodyguards for Iraq's Sunni finance minister fueled a surge in protests last week in Ramadi, about 110 km (70 miles) west of Baghdad, and in several other Iraqi cities.
"We don't want your food, your water and your medicine," one scholar told the crowd.
"When we want to express an opinion, we have to do it in a civilized, humane and patriotic manner," he said.
