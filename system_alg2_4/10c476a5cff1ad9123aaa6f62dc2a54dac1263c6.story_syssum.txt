Every time I got close to them they would fly away," photographer Timothy Bouldry said.
For the past seven years, Bouldry has traveled the world photographing landfills.
About 100 families live inside the Boragaon landfill.
The families make around $2 per day.
Their homes are constructed by recycled materials, with sometimes several families living in one shanty at a time.
Some of the children living in Boragaon go to school on scholarship, but most of them work in the landfill to provide for their families.
Bouldry lives and works inside the La Chureca landfill in Nicaragua, one of the largest landfills in the world.
But why?
Timothy Bouldry is a photographer based in New Hampshire.
