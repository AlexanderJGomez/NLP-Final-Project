(CNN) -- World number one Serena Williams put her recent controversies to one side as she cruised past Mandy Minella of Luxembourg 6-1 6-3 in the first round at Wimbledon.
"I don't feel like I played my best tennis.
The past week certainly hasn't been as smooth as Serena would have liked after becoming embroiled in a row with Maria Sharapova and having to defend comments made in an article that appeared in Rolling Stone magazine.

"I'm taking care of my body, because of course the most difficult thing is recovery.

In other highlights on Tuesday, the home crowd had a match to savor on Court One as 19-year-old Briton Laura Robson knocked out tenth seed Maria Kirilenko, who made the quarterfinals last year.
"That was a big one for me just because of all the nerves and playing in front of your home crowd at Wimbledon," said Robson, who won Wimbledon as a junior.
