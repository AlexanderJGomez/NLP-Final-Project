One of the most urgent is child farm labor.
And unlike their counterparts in retail and service, child farm laborers can legally work unlimited hours at any hour of day or night.
Children 14 and older can work long hours at all but the most dangerous farm jobs without their parents' consent, if they do not miss school.
Unlike teen retail and service workers, agricultural laborers 16 and older are permitted to operate hazardous machinery and to work even during school hours.
According to the 2010 Human Rights Watch report, the Department of Labor employees were spread so thin that, despite widespread reports of infractions they found only 36 child labor violations and two child hazardous order violations in agriculture nationwide.
If this year follows trends, Curvin will be only one of at least 100 children below the age of 18 killed on American farms, not to mention the 23,000 who will be injured badly enough to require hospital admission.
Farm parents, their children, and the American Farm Bureau objected strenuously to the proposed new rules.
Whatever you think of family farms, however, many child agricultural workers don't work for their parents or acquaintances.
Second, the Department of Labor must institute age, wage, hour and safety regulations that meet the standards set by retail and service industry rules.
Finally, the Department of Labor and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration must allocate the funds necessary for meaningful enforcement of child labor violations.
