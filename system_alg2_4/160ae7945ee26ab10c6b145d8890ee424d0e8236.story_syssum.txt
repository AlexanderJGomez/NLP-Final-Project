(Mental Floss) -- When it comes to parasites, it's all about perspective.
1.
As the parasite grows, it drinks more blood and eventually causes the tongue to atrophy and disintegrate.

A female sacculina begins life as a tiny free-floating slug in the sea, drifting around until she encounters a crab.
She grows "roots" that extend to every part of the crab's body -- wrapping around its eyestalks and deep into its legs and arms.
The female feeds and grows until eventually she pops out the top of the crab, and from this knobby protrusion, she will steer the Good Ship Unlucky Crab for the rest of their commingled life.

In an interesting (if scary) example of parasite ingenuity, filarial worm embryos living underneath the skin can sense the onset of night, which is their cue to head upward to the skin's surface in order to increase their chances of being picked up by a passing 'skeeter.

Eventually, these slender ladies get bored and decide they need to lay some eggs.
(Of course, in areas where an entire village shares a single water source, this helps spread the infection.)

Leucochloridium paradoxum are a type of fluke (a.k.a., parasitic flatworm) that prey on birds -- a fascinating turn of events considering they begin their lives as eggs in bird droppings.
First, they hang out in the droppings until a snail happens along and eats the bird dung.
So the bird devours the stalk and ends up with a bellyful of Leucochloridium paradoxum that will, of course, lay eggs and begin the cycle again.
