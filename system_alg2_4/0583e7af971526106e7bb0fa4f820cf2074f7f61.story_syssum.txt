If I had any inkling she was frying chicken, I'd go down and spend the night.
Our only disagreements were about food.
She was a great cook, and I think of myself as a good one.
Doc sat at the head of the table, where she could see everything going on in the kitchen.
I think she loved me a little bit because she, like my only living aunt, always felt free to make minor corrections.
I know if the lamb was not done properly, she would have eaten it and not said a word.
Like everyone, I have read and reread "I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings."
