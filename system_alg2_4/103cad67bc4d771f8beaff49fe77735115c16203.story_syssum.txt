(CNN) -- As we gear up for the 71st annual Golden Globe Awards on Sunday, allow us to turn the focus to the real winners of the show: besties Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.
Fey will always be known as the woman who gave us the quirky character of Liz Lemon on "30 Rock."
In addition to being one of the stars of the late-night comedy show, the show's creator and producer Lorne Michaels hired Fey as a writer in 1995, and she would later become the show's first female head writer.
The actress made her "SNL" cast member debut on the first show after 9/11.
The "Parks & Rec" actress has never won an Emmy, though she and Fey have competed against one another for best actress in a comedy series four times.
But while Fey has two daughters, Poehler has two sons.
The Golden Globes organizers were smart enough to lock Fey and Poehler in to a two-year contract to host the show.
