"I could have done this last year, not this hero stuff," said Ramsey.
He ran from his living room, clutching a half-eaten McDonald's Big Mac, to the house and helped free a woman identified as Amanda Berry.
"She's like, 'This (expletive) kidnapped me and my daughter,'" he told the 911 operator, according to WEWS.
When police came out with them, Ramsey told the station, "it was astonishing."
Ramsey told CNN he is no hero and should not receive any reward.
Explaining that he had no idea Ariel Castro, his neighbor, may have had other people inside his home, Ramsey said, "I've been here a year.
You see what I'm saying?
"Because we see this dude every day.
He added, "I knew something was wrong when a little, pretty white girl ran into a black man's arms.
#hero."
"You give him something to do, and he'll do more," he said.
Hodgson said people have offered to raise money for Ramsey, but the employee would end up giving it to the victims and their families.
"Hey bro," Ramsey tells the 911 operator.
She's like, 'This m--------r done kidnapped me and my daughter ...  She said her name is Linda Berry or some s--t. I don't know who the f--k that is, I just moved over here, bro.
You know what I mean?"
"Are the people that she said did this, are they still in the house?"
Like I said, I just came from McDonald's."
She's been kidnapped, so, you know, put yourself in her shoes."
