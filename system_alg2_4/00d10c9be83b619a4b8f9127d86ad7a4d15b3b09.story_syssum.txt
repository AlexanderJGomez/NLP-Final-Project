Super Bowl XLVIII started out bad for the Denver Broncos.
Denver didn't score until the third quarter, when the game was out of reach.
His counterpart, Russell Wilson of Seattle, went 18 for 26 to gain 206 yards and score two touchdowns.
Jermaine Kearse caught a 23-yeard pass from Russell Wilson with 2:58 left in the third quarter for another touchdown.
Denver, led by the 37-year-old Manning, has the NFL's best offense, statistically, but never got moving Sunday.
Richard Sherman, the Seattle defense player who mocked San Francisco after winning the NFC championship, was never really challenged.
A man was shot several times during a Super Bowl party at a residence in Denver, police said.
