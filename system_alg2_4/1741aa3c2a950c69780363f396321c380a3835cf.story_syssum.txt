Health officials are looking for the cause of a neurologic illness that's affected 10 children in Colorado.
Most of the children experienced a respiratory illness before being admitted to the hospital, although only two had a history of asthma.
The CDC is investigating the cause of these symptoms.
But a test of their nasal passages found enterovirus in six out of eight patients who were tested.
Of those six, four tested positive for enterovirus D68, which has been sending children across North America to the hospital with severe respiratory illnesses.
Samples from two of the children tested positive for enterovirus D68.
Enteroviruses are very common, especially in late summer and early fall.
The virus has infected at least 277 people in 40 states, according to the CDC.
Children's Hospital Colorado has treated over 4,000 children with severe respiratory illness since August 18, said Dr. Chris Nyquist, medical director for Infection Prevention and Control.
The CDC is asking other hospitals across the country to be on the lookout for similar cases and to send in information on any patients with these symptoms.
