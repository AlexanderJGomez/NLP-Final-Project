LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The investigation into the massive Station fire north of Los Angeles is underway with authorities working to determine how the raging fire started, fire officials in California said Wednesday.
However, Fire Chief Mike Dietrich with the U.S. Forest Service characterized Wednesday as a "good day," noting the fire is 28 percent contained -- up from 22 percent the day before.
He said firefighters have made progress controlling the northern and western parameters of the fire, but the top priority is to keep the southeastern corner of the fire away from areas along Interstate 210, including Pasadena, Aracadia and Sierra Madre.
Noiren said two dozen Forest Service workers also were displaced by the fire, and the agency lost an entire fire station to the blaze.
