This has been attributed to the lack of teachers willing to work in these areas.
Finally, we found that the presence of a friendly, but not knowledgeable, mediator can enable children to reach levels of learning similar to formal schools with trained teachers.
Schools can access this "cloud" over Skype and children can interact with the mediators over free videoconferencing.
It is now possible to formulate a new approach to learning, using these findings.
