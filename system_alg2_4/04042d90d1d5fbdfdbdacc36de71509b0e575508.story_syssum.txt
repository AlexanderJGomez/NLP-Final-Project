Earlier this month, a test conducted by the Leviathan Security Group showed that even "no-permissions" Android apps can access potentially sensitive data on your phone -- and transmit that data elsewhere via your phone's Web browser.
He also could see which apps were installed on the phone, and list some files belonging to those apps.
Last year the Skype Android app presented this kind of problem.
Finally, since no-permissions apps can launch the phone's Web browser, that provides a potential route to transmit some data from the phone.
For instance, developers sometimes build apps that store user data (such as usernames and passwords) in ways that could be easily accessed through the security cracks Leviathan found.
Or the app might open the phone's Web browser to allow functionality that could be handled other ways.
"This was information that we'd never given Google, either on a phone or within Picasa.
To make matters worse, Picasa Web-Album syncing had been switched off a week before the information was found."
