(CNN) -- New junior federal prosecutors literally started in the basement of the U.S. courthouse in downtown Brooklyn.
The work of this U.S. attorney's office is unglamorous, especially for new hires.
She is a workhorse, not a show horse, and she has flourished doing the hard, ordinary work of federal prosecution -- narcotics cases, organized crime (always big in Brooklyn), public corruption (ditto) and civil rights violations.
There is a Southern graciousness about her (and her accent), and it will certainly be on display in any confirmation hearings.
First, will she continue the emphasis on voting rights that Eric Holder displayed?
Will Lynch continue these efforts?
In any event, one verdict is clear: Lynch has come a long way from that basement we shared.
