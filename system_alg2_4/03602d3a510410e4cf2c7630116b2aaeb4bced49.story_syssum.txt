London, England (CNN) -- Metropolitan police in London, England, appealed Monday for further information about last month's death of a man who worked for a British intelligence agency and whose naked body was found in a padlocked duffel bag in his bathroom.
The crime scene did not seem to reveal much information.
"We do not believe there is any property missing from the flat," the police statement said.
An August 25 autopsy "established no obvious cause of death," police said.
Police believe Williams was last seen alive on August 15, when surveillance cameras show him shopping in the West End and Knightsbridge areas of London.
