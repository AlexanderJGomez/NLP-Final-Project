(CNN) -- Eight mass graves were uncovered in northeastern Mexico Wednesday, holding at least 59 bodies, the Tamaulipas state attorney general's office said.
There were 11 bodies found in the first six graves, 43 bodies in the seventh, and five in the eighth, the agency said.
"The mass graves found yesterday once again show the Mexican government's failure to deal with the country's public security crisis and reduce criminal violence which has left many populations vulnerable to attacks, abductions and killings," said Rupert Knox, a researcher on Mexico at Amnesty International.
Tamaulipas is one of Mexico's most active states when it comes to drug trafficking activity.
The Zetas have been blamed for the killings of the 72 migrants who were found in San Fernando last year.
