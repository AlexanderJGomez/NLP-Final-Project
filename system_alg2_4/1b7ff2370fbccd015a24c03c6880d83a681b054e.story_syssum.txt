It's just a coincidence that the release of the Michael Jackson King of Pop slot game on Tuesday is occurring along with the trial of the performer's physician, Conrad Murray, who's charged with involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death, said a spokesman for Bally Technologies.
A University of Nevada Las Vegas gaming analyst who reviewed the machine Friday predicted it is "going to be a popular game for a lot of people" -- though it is "unfortunate" that the game is being unveiled during the manslaughter trial, the analyst said.
The Jackson game is being introduced Tuesday at the Global Gaming Expo in Las Vegas.
The game will be in casinos by early 2012, he said.
The game emphasizes an immersion experience in which players sit in a chair with Jackson's music piped into speakers behind the headrest, and the tunes are intensified with subwoofers and thumpers, said Bally video game designer David Schultz.
The game targets people who grew up to MTV and recall Jackson's original videos, Bally executives said.
Because the game will be networked with other Jackson machines across Nevada -- a so-called wide-area progressive game -- the jackpots will start at $750,000 and extend into the millions, Bally officials said.
"It's just a fun game because you basically got Michael Jackson, the music and the dancing that is part of the game.
That's why I think it's going to be a popular game for a lot of people.
