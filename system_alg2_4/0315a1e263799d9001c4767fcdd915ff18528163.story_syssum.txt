Seriously.
Not so, my friend.
Just because a woman is hot does not mean that her life is perfect.
As a woman, I know this to be very true.
A hot man can become hideous, and an average-looking man can become the sexiest guy in the room.
Women DO NOT like bad boys.
I can tell you that if the right man with the right character came up to me and said "banana, banana, banana," I would giggle like a little schoolgirl and instantly feel attraction for him.
Women want to be approached, as long as it's by the right person.
Women want you to respect them, not admire them.
Respect yourself first, and women will follow.
Sitting on your couch watching "Law & Order" is not going to bring you results with women.
