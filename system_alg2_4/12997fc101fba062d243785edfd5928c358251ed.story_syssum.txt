Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, Democratic governors and even a Republican Cabinet member on Friday blamed GOP intransigence for the failure so far to reach a deal to avert the harshest impacts of forced spending cuts set to take effect March 1.
The president met with Democratic governors at the White House and later told reporters that the forced spending cuts -- known in Washington jargon as sequestration -- were the "wrong prescription" for reducing the nation's chronic deficits and debt.
Outgoing Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, the lone Republican in Obama's Cabinet for now, also called on GOP legislators to fully join the debate.
At issue are the forced cuts and how they came about.
While House Speaker John Boehner and other Republican leaders say they want to replace the forced cuts with other spending reductions that would be less harmful, some GOP legislators contend the across-the-board approach of sequestration is a good start.
Republicans, however, reject any talk of higher taxes or increased tax revenue after conceding on that issue in the January agreement that raised rates on the nation's top income earners.
"We are seeing it in our states."
The forced spending cuts to the military and other government agencies -- but not entitlement programs that drive chronic federal deficits -- were intended to motivate Congress to come up with a comprehensive deficit-reduction plan sought by both sides.
A $110 billion proposal by Senate Democrats, which is similar to a plan by House Democrats, would replace the forced spending cuts for a year by getting more tax revenue from millionaires, stopping some agriculture subsidies and cutting military spending after the end of combat operations in Afghanistan in 2014.
