On Monday -- the deadline for the letter, according to the teen -- the Shawnee Mission School District issued a statement stating that "she is not required to write a letter of apology to the governor."
A statement issued by Brownback on Monday did not reference Sullivan by name or mention the prospect of any apology letter.
"I had no idea what it was about or why I was being called into the office," she said.
"He said I was an embarrassment to the school and the school district and that I had been disrespectful," she added.
The principal then asked her to write a letter of apology to Brownback and his staff.
"The district acknowledges a student's right to freedom of speech and expression is constitutionally protected," the district said in its statement.
"The district has not censored Miss Sullivan nor infringed upon her freedom of speech."
"I hope there won't be any consequences and that my principal and the governor's office can move on," she said.
"The issue has resulted in many teachable moments concerning the use of social media," the district said.
