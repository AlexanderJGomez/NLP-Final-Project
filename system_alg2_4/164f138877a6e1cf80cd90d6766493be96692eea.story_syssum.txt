Bamako, Mali (CNN) -- Islamists in control of northern Mali said they forced a man and a woman into two holes and stoned them to death for committing adultery in the lawless region.
"They were stoned to death, the punishment for infidelity, according to Sharia, Islamic law."
The stoning Sunday is the first reported Sharia killing since al Qaeda-linked Islamists took control of the north.
The two groups now control two-thirds of northern Mali, an area the size of Texas that includes the towns of Gao, Kidal and Timbuktu.
Most residents in the area are Muslims, but have protested against the strict form of Sharia as Islamists remain determined to apply it.
In addition to the killing, Islamist militants have gone on a rampage for months, destroying sacred tombs in the region and vowing to target more.
They especially target Sufi shrines, which they believe are sacrilegious.
