West Milford, New Jersey (CNN) -- For Gary Oppenheimer, 2007 was a year of plenty.
So Oppenheimer took the produce to a local food pantry at a battered-women's shelter.
"
He tried to find a list of his town's local food pantries online where the extra produce could be donated.
He reached out to food pantries across the country through social networking, food banks, master gardeners, faith organizations and other groups to encourage them to sign up for inclusion in his database of food pantries.
The free online resource enables food pantries to register and be listed in a central nationwide directory, and makes it possible for American gardeners to easily find the local pantries where they can donate extra produce.
"The country is loaded with gardeners who have more food than they can possibly themselves use," Oppenheimer said.
"That's the food that ... we can get into the system to help diminish hunger in the country."
Lesko said the fresh vegetables will help his family eat more healthfully.
Although Oppenheimer cannot track the amount of produce that has been donated to food pantries, he said he's received messages from numerous pantries and clients across the country who've been given food as a result of AmpleHarvest.org.
