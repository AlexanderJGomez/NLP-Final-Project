Jessica Tuttle, 50, left, and Amanda Wagner, 49, have been running for more than 30 years.
Tuttle, who is a medical epidemiologist at the Georgia Health Department, feels that running gets her day off to a good start.
But a study out of Stanford University that looked at healthy aging runners found that running did not damage joints or leave runners less able to exercise.

That includes not running through pain, and resting if you have an injury, something Tuttle takes seriously.
"The biggest risk that runners will face as they age, with regard to injury, is overtraining, by far," says Mason, who recommends giving yourself a day of rest between runs, or cross-training on the non-running days.
Beyond the good news about aging joints, the Stanford researchers also discovered some surprising overall health benefits for senior runners when they compared them with non-runners of the same age: Those in the running group were less likely to die from heart trouble, stroke, cancer, neurological diseases or infection.
"Members of the running group, it took them 16 years longer to reach certain levels of disability," says Chakravarty.
"I really can't imagine not running; it's that much a part of my life," says Wagner.
