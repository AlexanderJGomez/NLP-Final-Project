And according to a recent sales report, Sony's PlayStation4 seems to have won the first round of the battle.
Microsoft say they sold over 2 million systems.
"These are two systems that are well-balanced to keep the furious battle between Xbox and PlayStation going for the next decade ... which can only be good for gamers everywhere," says David Hutchinson, chief video games writer for The Times of London.
While PS4 is being touted as the perfect machine for social media lovers -- offering games that players can share easily with friends -- Xbox One is said to be ideal for those after a multimedia machine that can multitask and switch between games, movies, music and applications quickly and seamlessly.
Hutchinson says this move gave Microsoft plenty of time "to gain an audience within a gaming community where the PlayStation had previously ruled supreme."
At the industry's E3 conference in June, not long after Sony went public with their early release date, Microsoft announced they'd priced their console $100 more than Sony's PS4.
In recent years, the video game industry has seen users develop a growing appetite for mobile devices.
"Rumors of gaming console death are a bit premature," says Eric Smith, a consumer electronics expert from Strategy Analytics.
"Casual gamers I think have moved on most likely to mobile platforms.
Smith says: "[Xbox One] does gaming as well, but it is targeted towards a much broader audience and I think there is a risk in that gamers look at it and say: 'This is not for me, this is not built for gamers first' ...
"The joint dominance of the Xbox 360 and the PS3 marked a great era for the gaming public," he says.
