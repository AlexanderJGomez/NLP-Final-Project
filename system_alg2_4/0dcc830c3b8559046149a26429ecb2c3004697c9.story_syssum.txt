LONDON, England (CNN) -- White supremacists, Islamic clerics, a controversial Kansas pastor and a U.S. talk show host are on a list of 22 people banned from Britain for "stirring up hatred," the British government said Tuesday.
The Home Office named only 16 of those on the list; it said it was not in the public interest to disclose the names of the other six.
Savage lashed out at Smith on his Web site, calling her a "witch" and asking how she knew of his show when it isn't syndicated in England.
Fred Phelps and his daughter, Shirley Phelps-Roper, are also listed for "engaging in unacceptable behavior and fostering hatred."
Phelps did not issue a response on his Web site.
Black established the white supremacist Web site Stormfront, which the Home Office called one of the oldest and largest hate group sites.
The list includes Mike Guzofsky, the leader of a militant Jewish group.
Al Quntar is "engaging in unacceptable behavior by seeking to foment, justify or glorify terrorist violence" in order to provoke terrorist acts, the Home Office said.
"Therefore, I do not hesitate to name and shame those who foster extremist views, as I want them to know that they are not welcome here.
