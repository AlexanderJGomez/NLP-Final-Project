I'm going to look like a complete fool, she thought.
Tomsche's first class was hard.
But she came back the next day.
"It's just crazy," the Arkansas City, Kansas, resident says.
She indulged in chips and ice cream, and drank soda by the gallon.
But overeating had already taken its toll.
Instructor Maria Venegas remembers when Tomsche first tried her Zumba class.
"She would go and sit down about a third (of the) way into class," Venegas says.
"But it has been my venture to become a Zumba instructor that has (been) the fountain of youth, for myself and many others."
"Every class is always different," Tomsche says.
"Now (she) walks in with a big smile ... shoulders back and head up high," Venegas says.
Tomsche does Zumba five to six times a week and tries to stay active the rest of the day.
I'm not out of breath when I walk up and down the halls at work, and even sleeping is easier since I don't have all that excess weight pressing down on me."
Tomsche is just happy she's gotten her smile back.
