The game's creators are partnering with Zynga, maker of such popular social games as "Farmville," "Cityville" and "Words With Friends," to produce Zynga Slingo.
"Slingo" is played by more than 55 million people through online, mobile and casino games.
"And we're proud to bring it to our players and make it even more fun and social than ever before."
The new game comes on the heels of the release of Zynga's 2011 financial report showing the company earned $1.14 billion but still ended up with a net loss of more than $400 million.
As of early Wednesday, Zynga stock was trading at $14.35 per share on Nasdaq.
