Both arms are strapped down and several straps secure his body to the gurney.
He lifts his head and shoulders off the gurney several times, as if he's trying to sit up.
State officials reportedly were unsure how much of the second and third drugs that were supposed to kill Lockett were actually injected into his body.
Perhaps some supporters of the death penalty find comfort in the fact that death by lethal injection is supposed to be painless -- more sterile than a firing squad, more clinical than the electric chair.
This is the state -- the state where I grew up, by the way, and where I once worked as a newspaper reporter -- that has the highest per capita rate of executions in the country.
"I hope that man was in more pain than anyone ever imagined possible," a woman from Oklahoma wrote on Facebook, echoing a sentiment I saw repeated.
It was Oklahoma, after all, in 1977, that was the first state to authorize death by lethal injection.
It was Oklahoma, in 1988, that lost an argument before the U.S. Supreme Court that it should be able to execute a man who was convicted of murder at age 15.
That a state was going to execute two men in one night drew international curiosity and condemnation.
But that doesn't excuse the state from ordering his death, especially in this way.
Oklahoma Supreme Court Justice Steven Taylor wrote, in agreement with the court, that Lockett and Warner had no right to know the source of the chemicals.
"Reporters exchange shocked glances," she wrote at 6:39 p.m. "Nothing like this has happened at an execution any of us has witnessed since 1990, when the state resumed executions using lethal injection."
The death penalty is on its way out in America.
But it's got a cold grip on Oklahoma.
