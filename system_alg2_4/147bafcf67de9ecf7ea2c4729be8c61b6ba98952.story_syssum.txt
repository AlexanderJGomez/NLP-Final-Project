The cast and producers were on hand at Comic-Con to preview the series, which was created by "The Avengers" director Joss Whedon and will premiere on ABC on September 24.
The series follows Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg), a S.H.I.E.L.D.
I got a call from Marvel saying, 'You really do have a big part in "The Avengers."
"S.H.I.E.L.D."
"We may see some people [from the films] and we may see some people from the Marvel universe who are not cinematic," Whedon said.
The show will introduce several new actors, and the producers see "S.H.I.E..L.D."
"I have that feeling that I have not had for a long time where I have assembled this extraordinary ensemble of talented and soon-to-be very full of themselves people," Whedon said.
