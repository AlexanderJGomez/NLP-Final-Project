The crisis that has killed thousands over 15 months was expected to dominate the agenda at the EU-Russia Summit in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Monday.
But a commentary in China's state-run People's Daily newspaper held out hope for a struggling peace plan and warned against military intervention in Syria.
In Syria on Monday, 42 people were killed Monday, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria.
The LCC posted a letter on its Facebook page slamming Russia and China for blocking tougher action against Syria, and criticizing the U.N. observer mission in the country.
Al-Assad denied Sunday that government forces were behind the recent "outrageous" massacre of more than 100 civilians, including dozens of small children, in the town of Houla.
"At this time, we are facing a war from abroad," al-Assad said in his first public speech since January.
His speech came more than a week after the U.N. Security Council condemned the Houla massacre, with members casting blame on government forces for the deaths.
Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Saud Al Faisal, said the Syrian regime is pushing for a sectarian crisis.
He added that, while Syria had agreed to Annan's peace plan, the regime has not implemented it.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Sunday that he had taken note of the Arab League leaders' suggestions, including requests to increase the number of U.N. observers and to set a time limit for the effort.
The United Nations for months has said more than 9,000 people have died in Syria.
