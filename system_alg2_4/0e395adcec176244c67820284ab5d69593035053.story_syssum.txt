"I was told that no matter how difficult I found the load to bear, I needed to follow the law or suffer eternal consequences," said Wanda Barzee about her husband, Brian Mitchell.
Mitchell used the revelations to explain his heavy drinking, his engaging in oral sex with Smart and his demand that she "demonstrate sexual activity" in front of Smart, said Mitchell.
"No," Barzee responded.
Mitchell told her prior to the Smart abduction "that I needed to take seven wives into my heart and home," Barzee said, adding that the news upset her greatly.
Mitchell ultimately ended the marriage with Kelly for reasons that Barzee said were unclear.
On June 4, 2002, the night of the abduction, she and Mitchell fought, Barzee said.
Mitchell faces life in prison if he is convicted of kidnapping and transporting a minor across state lines for sexual purposes.
Barzee is being held at a federal medical center in Fort Worth, Texas, where she has been receiving mental health treatment, including medication.
