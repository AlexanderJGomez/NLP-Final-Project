By the early 2000s, the music executive was carving a successful career with broadcasting giant MTV, holding strategic positions within the influential medial company both in the United States and Europe.
"We've ... been quite lucky in being able to create a brand that we have taken from our international stable and bring into the continent to be able to create content and experiences that people enjoy, localizing them to make sure that they cater to the attitudes and tastes of African audiences," says Okosi, now based in South Africa.
"Midge was such an important an influential part of my life as she served as my guardian the last two years of my high school career and has since remained a huge part of my life," says Okosi.
He first planted the seed of bringing MTV to Africa during a business lunch with the head of the broadcasting giant.
Yet, despite all the challenges, Okosi was determined to succeed.
At first, he says, the quality of the music videos was the biggest setback.
"[It's a] great story for Africa because it enables the world to see that we have a young vibrant, incredible youth culture that also is able to create great entertainment, great music," says Okosi.
Okosi says the future of Africa lies with the millions of young people across the continent who are willing to work hard in order to succeed.
"They're a bunch of young people that have the same aspirations as their international counterparts and they manage to succeed even despite some of the challenges that we face on the continent," he says.
