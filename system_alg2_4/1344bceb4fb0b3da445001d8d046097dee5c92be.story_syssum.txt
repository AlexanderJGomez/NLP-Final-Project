Tata Group Chairman Ratan Tata, whose company owns the Taj hotel, discusses this week's attacks in Mumbai.
But Tata Group Chairman Ratan Tata said those measures, which were eased shortly before this week's terror attacks, could not have prevented gunmen from entering the hotel.
However, Tata said the attackers did not enter through the entrance that has a metal detector.
All of our arrangements are in the front," he said.

Bullet holes and scars of grenade blasts marred the restaurant walls in the Taj Mahal hotel, Tata said.
As an example, Tata said it took three hours for firefighters to get water to the Taj after a blaze broke out in the oldest part of the building.
"They seemed to know [the hotel] in the night or in the daytime," he said of the attackers.
"We've been very complacent, because we've really not had this kind of terrorism inflicted upon us," he said.
"Rather than have us succumb to this kind of terror, what it has done is given us a resolve that nobody can do this to us," he said.
"I went up to him today and I told him how sorry I was, and he said, 'Sir, we are going to beat this.
We will not let this event take us down.'"
