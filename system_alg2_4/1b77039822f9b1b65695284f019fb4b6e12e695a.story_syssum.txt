(CNN) -- Dharun Ravi, the former Rutgers University student who was found guilty of using a webcam to spy on and intimidate his gay roommate, has reported to a New Jersey jail Thursday where he will serve a 30-day sentence, according to Middlesex County Sheriff Mildred Scott.
Berman defended the jail sentence Wednesday, CNN affiliate WABC reported.
I believe that he has to be punished and he will be."
Ravi was handed a 30-day jail sentence, three years of probation and must complete 300 hours of community service aimed at assisting victims of bias crimes.
His attorney said he intends to begin community service after he serves his sentence and will start paying his fines in August.
