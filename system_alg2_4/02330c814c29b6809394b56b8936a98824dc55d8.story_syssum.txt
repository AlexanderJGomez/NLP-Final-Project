"I don't feel like in England, the young players are dreaming of playing for the national team anymore," said Vieira, who is now Manchester City's Football Development Executive.
"I think it's maybe the lack of England's Football Association power, I would say," added Vieira, who won the World Cup with France in 1998 as well as Euro 2000.
The former French international argued a key part of his development as a player was linked to the time he spent with the French national team, in particular learning from the example of more experienced players such as Marcel Desailly and Didier Deschamps, the current les bleus coach.
"I'm sure he will go back to the national team."
On Tuesday the Football Association opened its elite football facility -- the $168-million St. George's Park complex -- which it hopes can help pave the way for the national team to win a major international tournament for the first time since 1966.
That is a good base to start with."
"We want to bring our young players from the academy through to the first team," said Vieira.
City particularly liked the way aspiring NBA players spent much of their day within an academy environment, which helps them "to learn how to behave as an individual", said Vieira.
