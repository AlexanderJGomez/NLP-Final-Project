The Federal Trade Commission is urging mobile phone app developers and phone companies to make it easier for parents to control the personal information being collected by smartphone apps.
In the follow-up, researchers found similar results, with 20 percent of the apps linking to general disclosure information or a privacy policy, the report said.
"Parents should be given the information they need to make informed decisions about whether to allow their children to use apps with these capabilities," the FTC report said.
A recent phenomenon of the digital age, apps -- or applications -- are programs that mobile phones users can purchase and install on their devices.
The agency urged developers and marketers to work together and develop accurate privacy disclosures regarding what data is collected through apps used by kids.
