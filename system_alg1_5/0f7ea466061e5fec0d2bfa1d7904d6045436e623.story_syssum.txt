"Puss in Boots" cost $130 million to produce, and it earned Dreamworks' third-worst debut for a computer animated film, beating only "Flushed Away" and "Antz," which started with $18.8 million and $17.2 million, respectively.
The 3-D "Shrek"-spinoff, cost as much as Dreamworks' "Megamind," which opened in early November 2010, but that film began with $46 million, and it played well through the Thanksgiving season on its way to a $148.4 million total.
That debut is less than Timberlake's last film, "Friends with Benefits," which began with $18.6 million on its way to $55.8 million, as well as Seyfried's recent "Red Riding Hood," which debuted with $14 million on its way to $37.6 million.
Moviegoers issued "In Time" an unenthusiastic "B-" CinemaScore grade, which may prevent the film from finding the same kind of legs that time-jumping thriller "Source Code" ($14.8 million opening, $54.7 million total) enjoyed earlier this year.
Johnny Depp's latest, "The Rum Diary," stumbled out of the gate with just $5 million.
In limited release, Sony's Shakespeare tale "Anonymous" started with $1 million out of 256 theaters.
Richard Gere's latest, "The Double," was D.O.A., pulling in only $27,545 out of 11 theaters.
Internationally, "The Adventures of Tintin" got off to an excellent start.
"Puss in Boots" -- $34 million
"In Time" -- $12 mil
"Real Steel" -- $4.7 mil
"Moneyball" -- $2.4 mil
