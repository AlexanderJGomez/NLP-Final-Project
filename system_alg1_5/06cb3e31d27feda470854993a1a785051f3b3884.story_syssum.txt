Well, that's what I'm doing right now," said John Berlin, staring into the camera with moist, red-rimmed eyes.
"I know it's a shot in the dark, but I don't care," he said, his voice breaking.
Then, that night, Facebook called.
As Berlin listened, stunned, they told him would indeed make a personalized "A Look Back" video for Jesse, using posts he had made public on Facebook before his death in 2012 at age 21.
A Facebook spokesperson said Berlin's video came to the attention of a staffer Wednesday, who shared it on an internal network.
But John's story and emotion moved us to take action -- so we did," the spokesperson said.
But he said Facebook, which introduced "memorial" pages for deceased users in 2009, wants to give users better ways to honor their loved ones on the site.
"Jesse was all about having fun," his father said.
"I'm glad that we're finding purpose in Jesse's death," he said.
