Called POWERcycle, Nuru Energy says it has developed "the world's first commercially available pedal generator" -- a foot or hand-powered device that can recharge up to five modular light emitting diode (LED) lamps in approximately 20 minutes, as well as power mobile phones and radios.
And human power really came to mind," says Sameer Hajee, chief executive and co-founder of Nuru Energy.
"It's light, it's cooking, it's mobile phone recharging and radio."
Hajee quickly realized, however, that innovative technology was not enough for the project to be successful in a place like rural Rwanda.
"If you look at this from the standpoint of the customer," says Hajee, "they would purchase the light for $6 and then they would pay about 20 U.S. cents per week for lighting.
"From the entrepreneur's perspective, in 20 minutes of pedaling, they're recharging five lights, earning about $1 -- any of us that work in Africa know that that's much more than people make in an entire day.
"What I would really hope is that, you know, there's certainly effort needed in providing grid quality electricity to these populations.
