Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Thousands packed Havana's Revolution Square on Saturday for International Workers' Day, drawing hordes of Cuban demonstrators, spectators, and trade unionists from around the world -- including the United States and the United Kingdom.
Since then, neither Castro has made a major speech on May Day.
"Tortured people do not exist," Castro added.
While Obama eased restrictions on small-ticket items such as family travel and telecommunications, and sent high-ranking envoys to Havana to foster fresh migration talks, broader discussions now appear at a standstill following a storm of criticism over Zapata's death and increasingly routine counter-demonstrations in support of the government that overpower the handful of weekly protests.
