Chris Christie in New Jersey, and Garden State voters don't think America wants a "Jersey Guy" president, according to a new poll released Thursday.
Still, a majority of New Jersey voters (53%) says Christie would not make a good president, slightly down from April, when 57% felt the same way.
If he does make a White House bid, a decision he's said he'll make "well into 2015," more than six in 10 New Jersey voters think he should resign his governorship, something his aides have said he won't do.
The sampling error is plus or minus 2.7 percentage points.
