One woman, in tears, said before the hearing, "He's coming home today."
"Gil Valle has been in jail for almost 21 months, seven months of that were in the indescribable hell that is solitary confinement, all for a crime that he didn't commit," she said.
But prosecutors said he was "deadly serious."
The database, which Valle was trained to use and had access to as a police officer, helped him research potential victims, prosecutors said.
"He is anxious to get home to his family, the people who supported him through this whole ordeal," she said of her client on Tuesday.
