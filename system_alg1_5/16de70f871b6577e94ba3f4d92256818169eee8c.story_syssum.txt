"He is not in a coma anymore," added the statement, which was oblique enough to be left open to interpretation.
As the months have stretched on since the accident, so has the reluctance to openly discuss the state of Schumacher's health within the sport's inner circle.

"There is a lot of public interest, they are concerned.
"What tortures the public is the same thing that tortures the family --progress is slow, progress is uncertain," said Peter Hamlyn, a consultant neurological and spinal surgeon and expert in the field of head injuries in sport.
"The first months are dominated by questions of survival.
Hamlyn, who operated to remove a blood clot on Watson's brain shortly after his collapse and then guided his slow and painful recovery, is credited with saving Watson's life.
"The thing about supreme athletes like Michael Watson and Michael Schumacher is that they have extraordinary physical reserves," Hamlyn said.
"It played a huge part," Hamlyn reflected.
"When you talk to individuals who've survived, they never gave up.
"Nico said he knows what a fighter Michael can be," explained Sturm, who reports on F1 for Tagesspiegel and Spiegel Online in Germany.
"One day, some months into this business, Muhammad Ali came to see him at the hospital," recalled Hamlyn.
The world waits to see whether Schumacher, the ruthless racer, the sport's record-breaking world champion, can once again be his own inspiration.
