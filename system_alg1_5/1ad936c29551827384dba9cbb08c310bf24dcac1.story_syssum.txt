Google+, which launched by invitation only in June, has been a hit among so-called "tech elite" journalists, bloggers and others heavily immersed in the technology and social-networking world.
"Google+ is a knee-jerk reaction, a study in short-term thinking, predicated on the incorrect notion that Facebook is successful because they built a great product," Yegge wrote in what was supposed to be an internal memo.
"Some people spend all their time on Mafia Wars," he wrote.
What's worse is that, in a follow-up post, he mistakenly made the memo public because he's "not what you might call an experienced Google+ user."
The firm puts forward two theories: 1) that the supply of social-media users is limited (and, presumably, mostly already on Facebook) and 2) that while it has a "striking new interface, rapid release of new features, and focus on user interaction," Google+ doesn't offer much that's truly unique.
"If Google's management truly believed in Google+ as the future of the company, they would be more engaged."
