Second, we're both standing up to cancer on Friday.
(First, uterine cancer, and then kidney cancer.)
No matter who you are, how wealthy you are, how famous you are, cancer will find a way into your life, affecting you or someone you love.
We, the people, must.
For all the issues and problems facing us all right now, this is one of the most pressing.
(That's right, pancreatic cancer, your days are numbered.)
But even with an incredible lineup of stars that includes Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Samuel L. Jackson, one of our executive producers Gwyneth Paltrow and America's newest sweethearts, Olympic gold medalists Gabrielle Douglas and Missy Franklin, there will still be cynics out there.
To these people, I say, "Stand Up.
To those who think cancer is solely a byproduct of unhealthy living, I say healthy people get cancer, too.
So do their mothers, wives, husbands, sons and daughters.
So that one day your grandkids or your great-grandkids will ask you, "What is cancer?"
