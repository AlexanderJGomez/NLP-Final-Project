James Taylor wasn't in the place, either.
Not the man, not his music.

The more recent app-enabled jukeboxes -- there is competition in the field; AMI is not alone -- are based upon a perceived desire: that customers in bars and restaurants are eager to pull out their smartphones, gaze at the little screens, see a full selection of the songs on the jukebox that's across the room, then, in AMI's words, take advantage of "a greatly improved user interface and a variety of new features, including automatic check-ins, better search capabilities, and a more secure purchasing process."
And besides, people can use the exercise.
Jukeboxes, though ... well, jukeboxes were never meant to be regarded from a distance.
What could be simpler: Head over to the jukebox, commune with its list of songs, feed it some money, listen to the music you've chosen.
There was an exceptional one in the first-floor bar of a long-gone Holiday Inn in Kansas City, where Aerosmith's "Dream On," when it first came out, sounded almost as good as hearing the band play the song live; a jukebox in a bowling alley called Wally's Seymour Bowl in Seymour, Wisconsin, had an especially crisp-sounding version of Alan Jackson's twang-and-power-chord remake of "Mercury Blues."
There is, at least symbolically, a throwback aspect to the app plan: Americans who are old enough may remember the little wall-box jukeboxes that were mounted next to booths in some restaurants, for the convenience of customers in mid-meal.
An old Wurlitzer, or Seeburg, or Rock-Ola.
Now, that would be something worth getting out of your seat to see.
