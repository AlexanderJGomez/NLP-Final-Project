I posed a less-wordy version of that question to Andrew Derocher, a biologist and polar bear expert at the University of Alberta.
"It will be a semi-wild, semi-captive, free-ranging carnivore.
It's really come to this.
He doesn't want to have to feed the polar bears, much less euthanize them.
If it's gone, they can't catch seals, which tend to stay far from land.
"It's ridiculous, human beings feeding polar bears.
Let them be."
It's very Yogi, as Derocher put it.
Or at the very least, Derocher said, they're ideas that could save them from extinction.
Current projections don't look good.
With all that as the backdrop, feeding polar bears doesn't sound so crazy, however sad and potentially irreversible it may be.
"Bears just aren't as fat as they used to be," he said, which makes them less able to live through low-sea-ice years.
It's linked here but, as a Mother Jones writer put it, "Be forewarned: this is graphic and ghastly."
For him, the video echoed his experiences in the Arctic, surveying bears that are struggling because of sea ice melt.
