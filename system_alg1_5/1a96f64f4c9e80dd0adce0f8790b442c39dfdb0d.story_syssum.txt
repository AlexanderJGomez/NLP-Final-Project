Levinson disappeared on a trip to Iran in 2007, and U.S. officials say they have no idea where he is now.
Levinson, now 65, had gone to Iran on a mission to investigate corruption involving the laundering of oil profits by Iranian officials, including former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, according to a source.
Levinson was on the CIA books as an "analyst," to write academic papers, with money laundering a particular area of expertise, McGee said.
When the Levinson family first went to the Senate Intelligence Committee for help, staffers contacted the CIA and at that point, the CIA told them "they have no connection with him at all," McGee said.
Confronted with the evidence, the CIA then demurred, said it would get back in touch and later admitted the relationship with Levinson, he said.
Ultimately, seven CIA staffers were disciplined and three were fired, McGee said -- including Levinson's chief handler.
