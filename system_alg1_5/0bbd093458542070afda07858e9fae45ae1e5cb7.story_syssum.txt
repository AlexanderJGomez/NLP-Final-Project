The allegedly blatant exchange between money and power, as revealed by China's state media, would eventually prompt Zhou's shocking downfall last summer.
Unlike Xi, who is "Communist royalty" thanks to his father's status as one of Chairman Mao's comrades in arms during the revolution, Zhou was born to a poor family in eastern China.
That school, now called China University of Petroleum, was the cradle for titans in the state oil industry.
In 2001, after a stint as minister of land resources, Zhou was named the Communist Party chief of Sichuan in southwest China, one of the country's most populous provinces.
Zhou's big break came in 2002 when he returned to Beijing and was put in charge of the ministry of public security, which runs the country's police forces.
Bo supporters, however, have long called him a political victim as the former high-flying politician was once considered Xi's main challenger for the top spot of Chinese leadership.
"Zhou challenged Xi's authority and threatened his rule -- that's why he's now being held responsible along with his gangs," offered Hu Jia, one of China's leading political dissidents, who was thrown into prison for more than three years on "subversion" charges when Zhou first took over nationwide law enforcement.
Most stories, though, have focused on the vast wealth amassed by Zhou's older son as well as his two brothers and their families.
State media reports also indicated that one of Zhou's younger brothers, a onetime farmer, used Zhou's influence to launch a "crisis management" business and profited from helping people get out of jail, enter police academy and sell steel pipes to state-owned oil fields.
"I think, unlike Bo Xilai, Zhou Yongkang will cooperate with investigators because his family is involved," said analyst Lam, predicting a suspended death sentence for both Zhou and his older son.
