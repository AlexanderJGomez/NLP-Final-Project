While his former Spice Girl wife, Victoria, remained at home with children Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz and Harper, Beckham spent time talking through his troubles to a man with a sympathetic ear.
"I think that being away from his family, them being in London and him being in Paris, was difficult for him.
"That's the sacrifice I have to make as a father and as a husband: being away from my family," Beckham said.
"The kids have moved across the world and I think he wanted them to have some stability," added Clement.
"It was great to have him around and talk, but I've got my family here and that's been so good for me.
"He's just a normal guy," said Clement.
For somebody so famous, he's just a normal guy.
"I had a feeling it might happen and he's going out at the top, which is the way he would like it," he added.
"It's nice to work with good players," said Clement.
"But it's more important to work with good people."
