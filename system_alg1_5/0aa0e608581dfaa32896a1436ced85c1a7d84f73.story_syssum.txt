Aron, 35, showed no emotion as he entered the court handcuffed and did not enter a plea.
"Here, I mean it's just, it defies all logic and I think that's what's really so, so terribly disturbing about this case.
Police said Aron, 35, made statements Wednesday implicating himself in the death of Kletzky.
Aron claims he took Kletzky to a wedding Monday night in Monsey, New York, and then brought him back, Kelly said.
Aron, a clerk at a maintenance supply company, did not appear to have known Kletzky, Kelly said.
Aron's ex-wife, Debbie Aron of Memphis, Tennessee, said she has been in "total shock" since she heard the news.
"Even as I talked to him not long ago, everything was fine, no indications that anything was wrong."
