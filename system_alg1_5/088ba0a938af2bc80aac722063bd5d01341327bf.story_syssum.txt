Earlier, the girl's family told reporters it had located a facility in New York willing to take Jahi.
The Oakland hospital, however, "refused to agree to allow us to proceed in that matter," according to the girl's uncle, Omari Sealey.
Before the surgery, Jahi said she was worried that she would never wake up, according to her uncle.
According to family members, Jahi went into cardiac arrest.
In court documents and public comments, they've maintained that there's no doubt that McMath is brain dead, describing the condition as irreversible.
When asked about the girl's possible movement, the hospital spokesman, citing privacy laws, said he would not comment directly on any claims the family makes.
Medical ethicists, meanwhile, say the high-profile case fuels a misperception: that "brain death" is somehow not as final as cardiac death, even though, by definition, it is.
CNN has obtained a copy of a medical report, contained in a court filing, that lays out in extensive detail the testing that supports the hospital's conclusion that McMath has no hope of recovery.
This was never our intention," the family's statement said.
