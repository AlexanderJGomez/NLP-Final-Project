So, is "Ghostbusters" progress?
No.
You can applaud Katniss, Elsa, and Anna, too.
In 2013, only 29% of 4,506 speaking characters evaluated were female.
In 2013 and 2014, there were only two female directors each year.
Male leads, stories and properties are seen as more profitable, while female stories and casts are seen as a risk.
For female directors, the financing structure, subject matter, and even perceived confidence of filmmakers creates a barrier to career progress.
Applied to Hollywood, the rule would stipulate that women and candidates from underrepresented backgrounds be considered or even interviewed when hiring film directors.
Then, the only unreal thing about "Ghostbusters" will be the ghouls and goblins, not the women busting them.
