"Our analysis found that, although the IRS detects and prevents a large number of fraudulent refunds based on false income documents, there is much fraud that it does not detect," said George's prepared testimony before a joint hearing of the House Ways and Means Subcommittees on Oversight and Social Security.
Last year, according to the Treasury Inspector General's Office, the IRS reported that of the 2.2 million tax returns it found to be fraudulent, about 940,000 returns totaling $6.5 billion were related to identity theft.
"Even with improved identification of these returns, the next step of verifying whether the returns are fraudulent will require resources," he said.
"When the identity thief files the fraudulent tax return, the IRS does not yet know that the individual's identity will be used more than once," George said.
As of last month, the IRS reported that it had stopped the issuance of $1.3 billion in potentially fraudulent tax returns.
To make matters worse, the IRS is not effectively helping the victims of identity theft, George said, adding that it can take more than a year to resolve these cases.
In most cases, the criminals buy a debit card so the IRS can issue the refund on that card, although some thieves have also gotten their returns on actual Treasury checks.
In the past four years, he said, the IRS has identified more than 490,000 taxpayers who are the victims of identity theft.
"Various new identity theft filters are in place to improve our ability to spot false returns before they are processed and before a refund is issued," Miller said.
