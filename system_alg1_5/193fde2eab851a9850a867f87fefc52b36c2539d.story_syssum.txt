"I had to create a character that no one would dare challenge," he said.
"I was at the lowest of my lows," he said.
"I was confused, lost, and didn't have the slightest idea of how to be a good father," said Dixon, now 30.
"What we want to do is get these people above ground and back into the mainstream," said Joe Jones, the nonprofit's founder and CEO.
"If we don't crack the code of men having babies for whom they're not responsible for, all of our efforts to build a better Baltimore will be limited," said Jones, 57.
"The one thing that is consistent with all these men is that they want to be involved with the lives of their children, but they just don't know how," Jones said.
When Dixon first came to the Center for Urban Families, he owed $47,000 in child support.
"You have a group of men speaking about issues they are having about their children," Dixon said.
"The first day I took him to school, I got the sense of fatherhood," Dixon said.
Jones grew up in Baltimore and remembers the day his own father left, when he was 9 years old.
"I didn't want to go to jail anymore," Jones said.
Working there, in the early 1990s, it struck him that there were no programs for fathers.
"When I learned Joe's story, (it) pretty much blew me away," Dixon said.
"Joe allowed me to find and restore my dignity," he said.
"That's one of the greatest things that you can offer anyone."
