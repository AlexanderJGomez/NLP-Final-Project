Authorities took McAfee into custody Wednesday, said Francisco Cuevas, a spokesman for Guatemala's president, Otto Perez Molina.
McAfee's lawyer, Telesforo Guerra, filed a formal request for asylum with Guatemalan officials Wednesday.
To put them out of their misery, he shot each in the head and buried them on his property, a former girlfriend said.
He said he will not surrender to police for questioning, adding that his priority is to clear his name.
Three people have been detained for questioning in the killing, police have said, and investigators are pursuing multiple leads.
