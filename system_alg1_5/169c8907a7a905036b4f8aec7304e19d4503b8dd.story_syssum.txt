Emma Sullivan, 18, said late Sunday that a Brownback staffer had notified her school's principal about the tweet, and the principal told her she had to write an apology to the governor.
"My staff overreacted to this tweet, and for that I apologize," the governor said.
"I had no idea what it was about or why I was being called into the office," she said.
"He said I was an embarrassment to the school and the school district and that I had been disrespectful," she added.
"At this time, I do not think an apology would be a sincere thing for me to do."
"I hope that the governor realizes the power of the people and how people can make things happen," she said.
"I hope there won't be any consequences and that my principal and the governor's office can move on," she said.
