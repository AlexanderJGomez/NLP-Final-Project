A candidate, a former Secretary of State, who was campaigning in Massachusetts where she said that 'don't let them tell you that businesses creates jobs,'" Bush said, referring to a line Clinton made last week.
That should be the mission.
"Hillary Clinton comes up and she says, 'Businesses don't create jobs.'
"The president says, 'you didn't build that, it just sort of happened,'" Paul said.
The remark caused the Obama campaign quite a headache in 2012, and it looks like Clinton's comments on jobs could have the same impact in 2016, if she were to run.
