While the group consisted of men and women, Bahgat said it was generally men who intervened when an assault was detected, to prevent women bodyguards from being sexually assaulted themselves.
Bahgat described Tahrir Bodyguard as "a story of what an individual with a computer and a Twitter account can start," said Bahgat.
At first I thought they were catching a thief or there was a fight," he told CNN.
"She's in a hysterical state, standing there in cut clothes, and being harmed.
When I felt her hands were catching, I told the crew, 'Let's move.'"
Exactly why the assaults were happening was "the billion dollar question," she said.
"It takes a long time though," she said.
"But the ones behind these attacks are not the true Egyptians," she said.
