"In 2013 the Foundation reconsolidated the Clinton Global Initiative into its operations," Andrew Kessel, the foundation's chief financial officer, wrote in a letter attached to the tax forms.
"In 2013, the Foundation expanded our work, reinforced our financial footing, and became better positioned to maximize our impact for years to come," Kessel said.
Early in 2013, just shortly after Hillary Clinton left her post as America's top diplomat, the foundation that was once simply known as the William J. Clinton Foundation was renamed to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation.
Since leaving the State Department, Clinton has stepped up her role in fundraising for the foundation, too.
