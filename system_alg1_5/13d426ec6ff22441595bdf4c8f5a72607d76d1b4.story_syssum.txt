On Monday, President Barack Obama offered the best rebuttal to date.
Reagan offered up a vision of an over-taxed, long-neglected "We the People"; Obama's version of "We the People" is youthful, diverse, energetic and engaged.
Instead of "government is the problem," the president reminded us that we could all fall victim to sudden misfortune.
This was not a partisan speech.
But he showed Monday that he is standing on the right side of history.
