Lennon, 17, played the lineman position for the West Bladen High School Knights, and was focused on football.

"He didn't do this to himself," Lacy says.
"When you just lose someone close to you, you're going to be depressed, upset, in mourning," Lacy says.

Lennon was 5-foot-9.
"His size, his stature does not add up to him being capable of constructing all of this alone - in the dark," Lennon's brother says.
Those were not his belts," Lacy says.
Also, the shoes Lennon was wearing when his body was found were not his, according to his family.
Those shoes were not with Lennon's body when he arrived at the state medical examiner's office, according to the NAACP review.
However, in the summary of the case, written the day Lennon was found, the local medical examiner asked "did he hang self?
"The comments that were released by the NAACP were a synopsis of a professional exchange between the NAACP's independently-retained forensic pathologist and Dr. Radisch," according to a spokesperson for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.
That's all I can say," Lacy says.
