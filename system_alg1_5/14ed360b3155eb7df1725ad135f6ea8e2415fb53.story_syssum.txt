For Alicky Sussman, that's the hardest part of living without her husband, Paul -- but it's also what's helping her cope with his sudden death.
But after Sussman's most recent book was complete, his editor says he changed his tune.
Taylor recalls: "He turned to me and said, 'Simon, I do think perhaps I've written quite a good book here.'
"In some ironic way, it (his death) got a little bit more attention for the book in the UK," says Morgan Entrekin, president of Grove/Atlantic, Sussman's U.S. publisher, "as people wrote about the tragedy of his death and the fact that this was going to be his last book."
"Some of the turns of phrases that he uses are so quintessentially Paul," she says.
Sussman also wove his wife into all of his stories.
"All of those things that you would normally talk about," she says.
In addition to his books, Sussman kept 25 years' worth of diaries.
"It's an absolutely hilarious book," says Laura Susijn, his longtime agent and friend.
But without Sussman, working on it would be heart-wrenching.
"If the product exists, you should get it out there," she says.
"For me, he's very much alive," Susijn says.
"I want people to hear his voice," she says.
"That's basically his legacy," Susijn says.
