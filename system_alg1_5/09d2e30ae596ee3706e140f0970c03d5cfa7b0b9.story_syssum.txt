Marcus Schrenker was taken to a hospital after being found Tuesday near Quincy, Florida, authorities say.
When authorities found Schrenker Tuesday, he had deep cuts on his wrists.
He had plenty of food, water and clothes, authorities said.
A federal arrest warrant was issued, and Schrenker will appear before a magistrate judge in Pensacola, Florida, after he is released and arrested, the statement said.
Authorities say Schrenker took off alone Sunday night from Anderson, Indiana, in a Piper PA-46 en route to Destin, Florida.
Quincy is about 215 miles southeast of Childersburg, Alabama, where Schrenker was first spotted after authorities believe he bailed out of the aircraft.
When police, who identified Schrenker using his FAA pilot's license, heard about the crash and returned, they found that he had checked in under a false name and had since disappeared, possibly into a nearby wooded area, authorities said.
"She is not guilty of anything other than trusting her husband of 13 years," said attorney Mary Schmid, who is representing Michelle Schrenker in divorce proceedings.
But the affair continued, and Michelle Schrenker filed for divorce December 30, the attorney said.
To Michelle's dismay, at the time her home was being searched, Marcus was in Florida with his girlfriend."
