Lately, Venner's anger had focused on the same-sex marriage bill which became law last Saturday, and the abrogation of which, he thought, the French should seek in mass street protests.
He dreamt, in fact, of a reactionary insurrection, a "French Spring."
Surveys have showed that the divide is both political and generational: The Left is, for the most part, in favour of the same-sex marriage law while the hard Right, and leaders of the French Catholics, Muslims and Jews oppose it.
The first civil union of this kind, between two gay men, will take place in Montpellier next week.
