Tuesday marks the final day of its eight-day operation in Los Angeles, which so far has resulted in the provision of at least $2 million in free health care services, according to Brock's early estimates.
Remote Area Medical, better known as RAM, is a volunteer organization that brings free medical, dental and vision care to people around the world.
On the final day of the Los Angeles operation, Brock said crowds were still gathering with the hope of receiving care.
He said RAM has treated at least 4,557 people, and that doesn't include figures from the last two days of the operation, which aren't available yet, he said.
The organization has been besieged for requests from a number of metro areas, including Detroit, Seattle, Miami and Atlanta, Brock said.
In that isolated area, it would take 26 days on foot to reach care, Brock recalled, and he wanted to find a way to bring medical care to such remote areas.
But it's a rewarding experience for volunteers when they get to see how much their efforts have been appreciated, he said.
