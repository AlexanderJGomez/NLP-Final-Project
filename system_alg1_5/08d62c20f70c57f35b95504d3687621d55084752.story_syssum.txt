Although the rules apply to all IM service providers, they are widely seen as targeting WeChat, the immensely popular mobile app that allows people to share text, videos, photos and audio recording with multiple users at once.
There are 5.8 million public accounts in China on subscription-based mobile apps, including celebrities, businesses and other organizations, according to state media Xinhua.
In April, Qin Zhihui, who goes by "Qinhuohuo" online, was sentenced to two years in prison for spreading false information on Weibo.
"It's quite obvious now, other public accounts are definitely going to be more cautious about republishing political news because no one knows how strongly the rules will be enforced.
The three-year-old WeChat, owned by Tencent holdings, is unlike any other mobile app.
"This is Beijing's dilemma.
The government wants to develop the Internet to drive innovation and economic growth, while keeping tabs on any potential political risk bubbling up online," says Lu Stout.
