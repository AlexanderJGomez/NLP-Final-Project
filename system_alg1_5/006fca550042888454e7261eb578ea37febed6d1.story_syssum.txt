Judge Antonio Cassese, the president of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, said in an open letter to the four men accused in the 2005 attack that they will be treated fairly if they appear before the court or even participate in the trial proceedings without being present.
Hariri, a wealthy entrepreneur turned politician, died when his motorcade was hit by a bomb in Beirut on February 14, 2005.
The judge said that if the accused don't wish to come before the tribunal at The Hague in the Netherlands, they can participate by video link.
If they can't afford lawyers, tribunal funds are available for hiring legal counsel.
