"Yes, it is hard work," said Pfc.
"In Iraq you are looking at more close-quarters combat in an urban environment, but in Afghanistan the area is only sparsely populated and we are looking at much more of a linear battlefield," said Lt. Matthew Fitzgibbon.
"No matter who the enemy is, we will bring a bigger fight," one soldier said loading his weapon.
"Yeah, there's been a lot of waiting," he said from a seat in the hull of the plane, facing his mine-resistant vehicle that was shipping out too.
In Afghanistan, they would be living in tents.
"We want to get our vehicle unloaded and then get settled in," Hutaff said.
"There is still a lot of work to be done here," said Fitzgibbon.
