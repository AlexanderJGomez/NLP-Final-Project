Three teenagers appeared in a juvenile court Tuesday in Gulfport, Florida.
If they had been in adult court, the charges would have constituted a second-degree felony, Judge Raymond Gross said.
The third, the alleged ring leader, is facing an additional robbery charge for allegedly stealing money from the victim after the beating.
Moody, 64, retired soon after the assault, ending an 18-year career of driving buses.
