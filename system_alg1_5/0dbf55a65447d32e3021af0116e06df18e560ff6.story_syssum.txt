"To the parents family and friends of Renisha McBride, I apologize from the bottom of my heart and I am truly sorry for your loss," Wafer said.
"I do not believe that you are a cold-blood murderer or that this case had anything to do with race or that you are some sort of monster," the judge said.
"You made the choices that brought us here," the judge said.
Before sentencing, Walter Simmons, McBride's father, addressed the court.
"I drew first, that's how I see it."
After the incident, Wafer told police he was angry and "full of piss and vinegar" when he opened the door that night, according to prosecutors.
