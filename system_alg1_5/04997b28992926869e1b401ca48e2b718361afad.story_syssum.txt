The gunfire forced the sailors, who did not return fire, back to the guided missile destroyer USS Bainbridge, the official said.
The American crew regained control of the vessel, but the Maersk company would not say how.
The crew will not be available to the media in Mombasa," Maersk Ltd. said.
Phillips lives in Underhill, Vermont, where neighbor and longtime family friend, Tom Walsh, told CNN the captain's wife, Andrea, was surrounded by relatives.
Earlier Saturday, pirates sailing a hijacked German cargo ship returned to port after failing to reach the area of the standoff with the Bainbridge, a local journalist told CNN.
Pirates have been searching the waters off Africa's coast for the Alabama's lifeboat, a U.S. military official with knowledge of the situation said Friday.
The guided missile frigate USS Halyburton, with helicopter capabilities, has joined the Bainbridge in the area.
For the U.S. Navy, bringing in more firepower is more than just a means to resolve a hostage situation, said Chris Lawrence, CNN's Pentagon correspondent.
"Well, we got the international news stories on television on the ship and everybody's concerned about the route that we were on because there was always the possibility that we would be approached by pirates," one male passenger said.
