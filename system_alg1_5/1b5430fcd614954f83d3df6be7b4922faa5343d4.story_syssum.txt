Senior U.S. District Judge Jack Camp Jr. has been charged with possession of cocaine, marijuana and the painkiller roxicodone, according to court documents.
Before the sting that led to his arrest, he told her, "Let me pay him, because you've already got a record," the affidavit states.
"If there is an indictment, then the next step after that will be a hearing," he said.
The dancer, who is not identified in court papers, had a prior drug-related federal felony conviction on her record and "recently began cooperating with the FBI," according to the charges -- but she began recording the judge before she became an informant, the affidavit states.
According to the affidavit, Camp pocketed the drugs and told the undercover agent, "We'll call you again."
