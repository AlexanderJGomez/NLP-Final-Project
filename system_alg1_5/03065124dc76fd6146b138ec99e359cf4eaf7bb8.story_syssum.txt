(CNN) -- Early Sunday, a massive fire at the Kiss nightclub in southern Brazil killed more than 200 people.
Fireworks triggered a fire and panic on December 5, 2009, at a nightclub in Perm, Russia, killing 156 people.
A December 30, 2004, deadly nightclub fire killed 194 people in Argentina's capital, Buenos Aires.
The cause of the December 1, 2002 fire that killed 47 people in Caracas, Venezuela, never became clear -- firefighters said it could have started in the kitchen, or an electrical short circuit.
Most of the victims were revelers suffocated by smoke.
