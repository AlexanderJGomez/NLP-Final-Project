For the first time in a week, there were no explosions, bullets or bombs coming from the Syrian side of the border.
Ras Al Ain, Syria, and Ceylanpinar, Turkey, are effectively one town, separated by a fence and a parallel line of railroad tracks.
Those refugee numbers swelled when Syrian regime forces struck back, pounding Ras Al Ain with artillery, airstrikes and bombardments with "barrel bombs" hurled out of hovering helicopters.
"We will respond to Syrian planes or helicopters that violate our borders," said Ismet Yilmaz.
"Of course we were afraid," he said.
An officer from the local Zabita, a municipal police force, said he was hosting 30 Syrian refugees in his home.
"From the beginning of the revolution, refugees came from all across Syria to Ras Al Ain because it was safe," said Rashid Mohammed, a Kurdish farmer who was living in the municipal building with 60 of his relatives.
Last summer, a Kurdish militia closely affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, assumed control over a number of predominantly Kurdish towns along the border with Turkey.
said Omar Aloush, a top official in the Kurdish Democratic Union Party, the Syrian wing of the PKK.
"All Syrians have to sacrifice, even the Kurds, because they are part of the Syrian people."
On Friday, the Turkish government once again denounced the Syrian regime, claiming it had no legitimacy.
