After the letter was checked out by military bomb disposal units, police declared the all-clear.
A Facebook friend of the shooter told CNN he believed the page, which has since been deleted, matched the profile of his friend.
While police haven't formally released the name of the gunman, they said he was a 22-year-old man born in Denmark.
However, based on that report, PET "did not have reason to believe that the now deceased 22-year-old was planning an attack," the statement said.
"An attack on Denmark's Jews is an attack on everyone," she said.
Lars Vilks, a Swedish artist who attended Saturday's forum, says he thinks he was probably the target of the attack.
The Jewish Society of Denmark identified the deceased as Dan Uzan, 37.
The funeral will be open to all.
