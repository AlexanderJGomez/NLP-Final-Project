Last year, a French court sentenced Noriega to seven years in prison for money laundering.
Noriega denied the charges.
When U.S. forces invaded the country, Noriega fled his offices and tried to seek sanctuary in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City.
While in U.S. custody, Noriega suffered from prostate cancer and had a stroke.
