The trial stems from a well-publicized incident that took place during a ceremony at a five-day retreat in Sedona, Arizona, on October 8, 2009.
Prosecutors claim Ray, 53, was reckless and that the lodge -- made of willow trees and branches, and covered with tarpaulins and blankets -- was heated to a perilously high temperature, causing the participants to suffer dehydration and heat stroke.
Kirby Brown, 38, of Westtown, New York, and James Shore, 40, of Milwaukee, died on October 8.
"(Ray) knew that people were in trouble," Tom McFeeley, Brown's cousin, told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell on Monday.
The sweat lodge, 5 feet tall and 23 feet wide, was built to accommodate up to 75 people.
This was a five-day retreat, not a cult.
