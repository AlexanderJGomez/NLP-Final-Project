Last college football season, everybody was talking about Johnny Manziel.
But now, after another scandal in an offseason that has been too eventful,  Manziel and fans alike may have been better off with the Private Johnny Football.
June 29, 2012: Manziel is arrested in College Station, Texas, after a bar fight.
November 11, 2012: Manziel leads Texas A&M to the biggest upset of the college football season, beating Alabama 29-24.
December 24, 2012: Manziel plays golf with Jonas Brothers Joe and Nick.
January 16: Oklahoma head coach Bob Stoops says of Manziel, "If they can keep him out of jail or keep him eligible, he's gonna be pretty good."
Stoops then adds of the occasionally oversharing quarterback, "If they can keep him off Twitter, he might win three or four Heismans."
He later tweets fans should try to "walk a day in my shoes."
The next week, A&M head coach Kevin Sumlin said, "I think, off the field, there's no question he's made some mistakes."
July 15: Two days later, Manziel pleads guilty to possessing a fake driver's license and was fined $2,000 in that 2012 bar fight case.
