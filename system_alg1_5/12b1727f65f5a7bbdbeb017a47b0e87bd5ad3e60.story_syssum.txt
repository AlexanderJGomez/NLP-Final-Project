Five officers were arrested Thursday night, the agency said.
The video, posted on YouTube, shows two young men wearing only their underwear.
At one point, an interrogator asks a question.
The police source said officials believe the video was shot by one of the arrested officers.
They are expected to testify against the officers, he added.
Argentines are especially sensitive to police and military brutality.
