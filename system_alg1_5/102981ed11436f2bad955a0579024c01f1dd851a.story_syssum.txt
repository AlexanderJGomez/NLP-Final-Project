Chavez's brother, Adan Chavez, who is governor of Chavez's home state of Barinas, recently returned from Cuba, where the president is undergoing cancer treatment.
His comments came as Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, an ally of Chavez, visited Cuba in a show of solidarity, and just days after Chavez's health problems prevented him from being in Caracas for his inauguration ceremony.
Chavez allies, including a majority of lawmakers in the country's congress, have said he should remain in power while taking the time he needs to recuperate.
