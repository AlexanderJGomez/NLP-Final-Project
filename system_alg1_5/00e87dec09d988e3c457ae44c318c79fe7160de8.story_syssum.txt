Jimmy Carter (54%), George Herbert Walker Bush (59%) and Clinton, who have been out of office between 31 and 11 years, all earned personal approval ratings north of 50%; only George W. Bush, who stepped down three years ago, is below 50%.
That comment led Clinton to apologize.
Fighting about who did what in the 1980s, Clinton thinks, is a sure loser.
"Don't stop thinking about tomorrow.")
Clinton disagreed but (mostly) kept his mouth shut about it.
But Clinton's grudge isn't personal; it's about how best to mount and run a campaign.
