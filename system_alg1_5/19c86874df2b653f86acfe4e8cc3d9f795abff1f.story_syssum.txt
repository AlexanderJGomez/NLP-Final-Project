In two years, nearly 500 families in Philadelphia had their homes or cars taken away by city officials, according to records from Pennsylvania's attorney general.
But Kabateck disagrees, "It's a good law.
Philadelphia filed nearly 7,000 petitions in one year alone, according to the class action lawsuit, in which the Sourvelises are plaintiffs, along with other Philadelphia citizens.
The very authorities taking the property appear to be profiting from it, according to Pennsylvania state records.
The DA's office also says it works directly with citizens, the police, government agencies, and community groups in an effort to abate or close drug properties.

The Philadelphia District Attorney's office told CNN it strictly follows the state law in an effort to crack down on drug abuse.
