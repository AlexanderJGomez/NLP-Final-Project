My first war assignment -- Bosnia, in the 1990s -- included visits to the Sarajevo morgue to see the bodies.
I learned to seek the facts, to tell the truth no matter how difficult or unpopular.
Most of all, I learned that as reporters our words and our actions have consequences and that we must use this powerful platform, television, responsibly.
They are wrong.
It means killing people not because of what they did, but because of who they are.
And sure enough, instead of using the convention as a springboard to action, political leaders in the ensuing years have invoked reason after reason not to stop the bloodshed.
Over the course of filming a two-hour documentary, I found a few common threads.
And some, like Canadian Lt. Gen. Romeo Dallaire, who led a U.N. peacekeeping force in Rwanda, believe they did not do enough.

In any single crisis, I can understand that political leaders are under pressure not to intervene.
Or the first resort?
And because we the press, the storytellers, finally made it impossible for our Western democratic governments to tolerate mass murder of men, women and children in the age of 24/7 satellite TV, 3Â½ years later, the U.S. led its allies in a pre-emptive strike against genocide in Kosovo.
So thank goodness for the few good men and women who summon the courage to do something in the face of evil, to stand up and confront it.
They give me hope.
