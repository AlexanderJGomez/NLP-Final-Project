Germany let loose the diplomatic slap, reminiscent of a Cold War rebuke, after news of two new possible U.S. espionage cases broke back to back in a week's time.
A German official confirmed that person was the CIA's station chief and that the agency's director, John Brennan, has talked multiple times with his German counterpart.
"One can only cry over so much stupidity," he said.
"From a common sense standpoint, in my opinion, spying on allies is, in the end, a waste of energy.
ISIS, Syria, terrorism -- all take priority over spying on each other, she said.
Amid the new allegations, the top U.S. and German diplomats are expected to meet in Vienna, Austria, this weekend during multination negotiations about the future of Iran's nuclear program, a senior U.S. State Department official said.
Across the Atlantic in Washington, the new allegations have also raised the eyebrows of some elected officials.
