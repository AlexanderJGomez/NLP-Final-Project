The idea of "no-go zones" sparked controversy last week when a Fox News commentator raised the prospect of areas in France, Britain, Sweden and Germany where those countries' governments "don't exercise any sovereignty," and which instead are run largely by Muslim immigrants.
This guy is clearly a complete idiot," he said.
