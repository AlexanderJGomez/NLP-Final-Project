(CNN) -- In April 1964, only a few months after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, his widow Jacqueline Kennedy wrote to Kay Halle -- an old family friend of both the Kennedys and the Churchills -- and gave a glimpse of the dark melancholy that shrouded her.
As a result, history has been deprived of important, albeit disturbing, facts surrounding the assassination and its effect on those closest to JFK -- especially his widow, whose grief included suicidal thoughts expressed to a priest.
But a wealth of letters and other documents -- including an extensive oral history by Mrs. Kennedy kept under wraps at the JFK Library until 2011 -- remained out of sight, well past her death in 1994, leaving the historical record incomplete.
Richard McSorley, a Jesuit friend of Robert F. Kennedy's family, though none apparently knew of McSorley's involvement with Jackie.
She shared her doubts about God, fate, a heavenly afterlife with her slain husband, and her children's immediate future.
But soon after a complaint from the Kennedy family, Georgetown access was closed to Jackie's letters in McSorley's files.
These letters, containing sentiments similar to those Jackie confided to McSorley, were published by various publications but were eventually returned to the Kennedy family, reportedly at the direction of Caroline Kennedy, her daughter.
"Is it enough to just keep doing things in a private way -- as one would do if not President -- Go to the theatres, symphonies, etc.
After JFK's assassination and the 1965 death of Winston Churchill, Halle remained in touch with both families.
Around her children, Jackie wrote, Randolph "was completely himself -- and never changed gears for them."
"If, when he is older, he finds in them what his father found in them -- that would be this strange, touching legacy of Randolph's," Jackie concluded.
Surely, both JFK and Jackie Kennedy, with their keen sense of history, would have understood.
