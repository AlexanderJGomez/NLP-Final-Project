Some have gotten into the habit, it seems, of visiting neighborhoods there, and on Thursday, one was caught literally hanging around -- in a Daytona Beach man's hammock.
He -- or she -- stayed in the hammock for about 20 minutes, said photographer Rafael Torres, who snapped pictures of the bear from 60 feet away.
But there was a handful of black bears roaming the neighborhood at the time of the attack, they said.
Once a bear feels too at home among people, relocating it doesn't help, the FWC said back then.
