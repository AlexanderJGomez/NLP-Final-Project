"I need support, I need help because I'm representing Afghanistan -- especially disabled people," says Malek, who more than anything, wants to swim for his country at the 2012 Paralympic Games in London.
Malek's younger brother, Samandar, beams with pride as he watches his sibling swim the length of the pool.
"I don't have any coach or any trainer to teach me how to swim, how to prepare for the games, so I'm doing by myself, because I love swimming," says Malek.
Nikpai, who was swimming in the same pool as Malek when we visited, is keenly aware how difficult it is to excel in athletics in Afghanistan.
When he's not swimming, Malek spends time at the track running and working to stay in shape.
I am really hoping for him to compete in the London Paralympics," says Nikpai.
"I am so happy to see someone like him, who has no legs, still swimming," says friend Raza Javed.
Malek knows that whatever happens, in a sense, he's already won.
