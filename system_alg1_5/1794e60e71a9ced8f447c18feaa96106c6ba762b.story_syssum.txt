Unfortunately for Democrats, the importance of organized labor has diminished dramatically since the 1970s.
Many Democrats since the 1960s, including some environmentalists and civil rights advocates, concluded that unions were too often in opposition to their goals.
The relationship has a long, important history.
While FDR's policies benefited workers, including the new Congress of Industrial Organizations, or CIO, labor came out in droves for the Democrats.
Without unions and the kinds of policies they helped Democrats find support for, leaders like Reuther realized, there would be very little to prevent the middle class from gradually withering away.
Many of the most vibrant parts of the economy, such as the service and high-tech sector, did not offer unionized jobs.
As labor became less important, a large number of Democrats became cool to unions.
It would offer a stark contrast to a Republican Party that has been extremely aggressive, at the national and state level, in its attacks on unions and the organization of the workforce.
Only then will Democrats once again start to celebrate and appreciate the importance of Labor Day to their party.
