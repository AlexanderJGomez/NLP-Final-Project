Japan's nuclear watchdog, the Nuclear Regulation Authority, had previously given a green light to the reopening of reactors 3 and 4 of the Kansai Electric Power Company's Takahama nuclear plant.
It changes the calculus and the dynamics," he said.
The nuclear plant operator had argued in court that the plant was safe, meeting heightened safety regulations introduced by the nuclear watchdog following the Fukushima disaster.
But the court ruled that the new safety standards were "loose," lacked rationality and could not guarantee the safety of the plant, an official said.
Prior to the Fukushima disaster, about 30% of Japan's energy was nuclear generated.
