Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Once upon a time, Maxwell's hair would have walked into a room five minutes before he did.
We're backstage at "The Jay Leno Show" in Burbank, California, where the mood is jubilant.
This time, Maxwell insists that he won't lose focus.
Maxwell: I didn't know.
I didn't know what people would want of me, if they wanted me back at all.
Maxwell: I don't think so.
CNN: While you were away, it was easy to think you were gone because of something troublesome.
Maxwell: When there's no information, people create whatever they want.
He'll make his movies, and then he'll go do his thing, and I think people just leave him to himself.
CNN: Sounds like kind of a "Sasha Fierce" mentality, where you have your alter ego.
I might do that.
Maxwell: It was just easier to deal with life in the morning, to be honest with you.
For me, it's about transformation.
