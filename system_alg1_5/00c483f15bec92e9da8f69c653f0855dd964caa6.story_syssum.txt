London (CNN) -- London's Heathrow Airport is "fully operational" and returning to normal after an emergency landing Friday forced the closing of both runways, the airport said -- but many travelers are likely to suffer delays anyway.
A British Airways plane bound for Oslo was forced to make the emergency landing "due to a technical fault," the airline said.
"Airline colleagues are now caring for customers in the airport terminal," said British Airways.
"We believe the fire is now out," it said via Twitter.
"We've just been sitting, waiting in a plane meant to take off" this morning, she told CNN iReport.
On average, 190,000 passengers travel through the airport each day, half arriving and half departing, according to Heathrow's website.
