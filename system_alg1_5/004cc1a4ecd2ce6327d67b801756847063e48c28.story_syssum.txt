For one thing, the postal service has been a huge employer.
Just everyday people who, like me in 1980, were attracted to a job that had good benefits, job security, and started at $8.10 an hour.
Above all, postal workers were proud of having a career serving the public.
Even as they faced discrimination at other jobs, many found work there with college degrees or military service under their belts.
By 1970, they had become twice as likely as whites to work for the post office, and even before the wage bump that year, the job had afforded them a middle-class status and the ability to accumulate wealth.
Or that the post office is the victim of an artificial deficit created by the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, signed by President George W. Bush, which forces the Postal Service to pre-fund its retiree health benefits 75 years into the future over the next 10 years.
.
1351, introduced by Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Massachusetts, a bill that would at least allow the Postal Service to transfer surplus pension funds to satisfy the retiree health plan pre-fund requirement.
