(CNN) -- As the United States prepares to build its first new nuclear power reactors in three decades, concerns about an early generation of plants have resurfaced since last year's disaster in Japan.
Stephen Hanauer, a former top safety official at what was then the Atomic Energy Commission, warned in 1971 that in an accident in which the core slowly loses coolant and overheats, the Mark I containment "would overpressurize.
In 1978, the NRC, which replaced the AEC, decided that the design was safe.
"A hardened vent is just a way of saying we're going to uncontain the containment," said Ken Bergeron, a former physicist at the Sandia National Laboratory in New Mexico, who took part in the NRC review.
In an October hearing before the NRC's Petition Review Board, he said the vents were a "Band-Aid fix" for the design that failed "not once, not twice, but three times" at Fukushima Daiichi.
As for GE, he said, "They got the rule book from the federal government, and they said 'This is all you have to design it for.'
"From the point of view of public safety, that's a home run," he said.
But he added, "The GE Mark I containment structure design is a proven, reliable technology.
"We need still a little bit more time to find out what really happened," said John Lee, a nuclear engineering professor at the University of Michigan.
But on February 9, the NRC approved two new reactors at the Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia.
