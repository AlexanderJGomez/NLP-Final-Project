On Tuesday, the NYPD's Twitter account, @NYPDNews, asked New Yorkers to "tag themselves" in photos with New York Police officers using the hashtag #myNYPD.
Twitter is a great tool to read breaking news, research prospective clients, connect with friends, discuss live events or gain access to your favorite celebrity.
Twitter users are the youngest demographic of all major social media outlets.
If you need to control the conversation, use Facebook.
On Twitter, the users are in control.
People on social media are ruthlessly honest, way more so than they would be in person.
But obviously, there are exceptions, like NYPD's Twitter fiasco.
Unfortunately, common sense, safe driving and social media rules are a lot like deodorant, the people who need it the most don't use it.
