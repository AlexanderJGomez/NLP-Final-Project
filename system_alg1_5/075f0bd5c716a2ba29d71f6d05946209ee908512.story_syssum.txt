Perhaps the least protected, underpaid work force in American labor, children are often the go-to workers for farms looking to cut costs.
The numbers are hard to estimate, but between direct hiring, hiring through labor contractors, and off-the-books work beside parents or for cash, perhaps 400,000 children, some as young as 6, weed and harvest for commercial farms.
Children 12 and older can too, as long as their parents agree.
This lack of oversight has dire, sometimes fatal, consequences.
It is the most dangerous for children, accounting for about half of child worker deaths annually.
Farm parents, their children, and the American Farm Bureau objected strenuously to the proposed new rules.
Despite exposure to all the hazards, these children never learn the craft of farming, nor do most of them have the legal right to the minimum wage.
Children in agriculture should not be exposed to more risks, longer hours, and lower wages at younger ages than children in other jobs.
Let's make sure it's not one our children have to die for.
