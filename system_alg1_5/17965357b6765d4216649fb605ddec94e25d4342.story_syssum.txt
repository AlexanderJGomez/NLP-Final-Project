"While we have obligations to abide by decisions of the AU, we are also under obligation to other international agreements including the Rome Statutes," Kachali said.
The AU, the organization of countries across the African continent, has said before that its members shouldn't cooperate with al-Bashir's arrest.
"Malawi joins an increasing number of countries that have declined to welcome al-Bashir," said Alan Wallis, international justice lawyer at the Southern Africa Litigation Center, quoted by Human Rights Watch.
After she took power, she said Malawi would host the summit but stressed that al-Bashir wouldn't be welcomed because of the arrest warrant.
