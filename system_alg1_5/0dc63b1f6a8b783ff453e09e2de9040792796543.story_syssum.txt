"I think it is too hard for men to talk about gender," says Sandberg.
"I don't think men should be part of "Lean In" or part of equality because it's nice for women.
Most women, if they get senior, have never worked for a woman, because again, 86 percent of the top jobs are held by men.
In the midst of moving to Google and then Facebook, Sandberg wed and had two children, a boy and a girl.
"We've never, in all of human history, seen a generation of brighter, better educated or more ambitious women," she writes.
What's more, Sandberg has also noticed it is women, not men who've been most vocal about the book.
"Lean In is not about fixing women.
And it's certainly not about any one person doing this on their own," she asserts .
