Its mother, Bai Yun, will care for the newborn by herself until she starts leaving the den regularly, at which time members of the zoo's giant panda team will step in briefly to check on the cub, he said.
Weighing in around 300 pounds, Bai Yun is about 1,000 times the size of her cub, who weighs around 4 ounces., the typical size of a baby panda, Swaisgood said.
It would be pink and hairless and completely dependent on the mother," he said.
In four to five months, the cub will be ready for the public, Swaisgood said.
Until then, the public can view live video of the cub and its mother on the zoo's Web site.
