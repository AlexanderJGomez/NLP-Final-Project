In July 2010, a state law was enacted prohibiting the NYPD from keeping a computer database of the names and personal information of people who were unjustly stopped, questioned or frisked by police officers and were neither arrested nor issued a summons.
Lino, who is black, has been stopped at least 13 times by NYPD officers, according to the NYCLU.
"It is humiliating enough to be stopped and frisked for no reason, having your name and address kept in a police database only prolongs the indignity of it," he said.
The lawsuit claims that police officers routinely stop minority men, particularly black and Latino men, without legal reasons.
