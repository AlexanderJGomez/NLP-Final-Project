I have made many films around the world about angry and alienated men who, lacking positive ways to express their innate power and potential, inflict brutality on women and children.
Yes, there are places, like New Zealand, where 20% of men choose vasectomies, but there are countries where the rate is less than 1%.
Sadly, while men waffle on the sidelines, more than 300 million women have had tubal ligations -- six times the number of men having vasectomies, even though tubal ligations are more invasive, costly and risky.
And it's not just men.
In my travels, I met men in their 20s who know they don't want children and men in their 70s who do.
On World Vasectomy Day, we don't decide who should or should not get a vasectomy, but we do insist that it be voluntary.
For all our efforts to inspire men, it wasn't until we empowered the urologists and vasectomists who perform these procedures that our movement took off.
Men reveal the best of who we are when we work together to serve a greater purpose, one that honors ourselves, our families and our future.
