LONDON, England (CNN) -- A yellow smiley-face badge, smeared with blood, has become the trademark for "Watchmen," the most critically revered of all comic books -- but it could also represent its troubled journey from page to big screen.
"Watchmen," created by the UK comic-book team of writer Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons, surfaced in 1986 as a monthly 12-issue series published by DC Comics (part of Time Warner, which owns CNN parent company Turner Broadcasting).

Perfect fodder, one might think, for the multiplex -- but "Watchmen" has been lodged in Development Hell for the best part of two decades.
As the latter, the "Pan's Labyrinth" filmmaker, told IGN: "I just couldn't get my head around 'Watchmen' being two or three hours long."
The comic-book series "From Hell," in which Moore uses the Jack the Ripper killings as a precursor to 20th-century violence, runs to about 500 pages, including 40-plus pages of footnotes.
Following the $450m-plus taken worldwide by Snyder's "300" (2006)  -- a hyper-stylized take on Frank Miller's ancient Greek suicide-mission -- it was announced that "Watchmen" would be his next project with Warner Bros. Paramount, which abandoned plans for the movie in 2005, took international rights.
Snyder has retained "Watchmen's" 1980s setting and also recruited original artist Gibbons -- who still retains friendship with Moore -- to advise on production design.
"I can tell you that I will also be spitting venom all over it for months to come," he added.
After all, successfully mixing pyrotechnics and narrative is how the most satisfying genre features of recent years -- such as Peter Jackson's "Lord Of The Rings" trilogy and Christopher Nolan's "The Dark Knight" -- have found artistic, as well as commercial, favor.
What Alan Moore might think is another issue.
