The bus, which was headed to Matamoros, Mexico, flipped and landed on its right side, he said.
Although it was not immediately clear whether others were taken elsewhere, Wiley said that University Health System and Brooke Army Medical Center are the two trauma centers in San Antonio and would receive patients in situations such as Tuesday's crash.
Maureen Richmond, a spokeswoman for Greyhound, said that 40 people were on board the bus, which left San Antonio shortly before 9 a.m. for Matamoros, Mexico.
Mark Baldon, who came upon the crash shortly after it happened Tuesday morning, said he saw the bus "smoldering," CNN affiliate KSAT reported.
