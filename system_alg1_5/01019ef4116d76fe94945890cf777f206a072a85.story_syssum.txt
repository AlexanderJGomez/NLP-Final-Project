In a bench trial in October 1999, Donald Kagan said he was acting in self-defense when he shot Wavell Wint, 23, during a confrontation at a Brooklyn movie theater 11 months before.
Barbaro, now 86, said in an exclusive interview with CNN this year, "I couldn't get out of my mind the look on the lawyer's face when I said I found him guilty.
"I believe she made a terrible error," he said.
Kagan's lawyer, Richard Mischel, said he plans to appeal Simpson's decision.
