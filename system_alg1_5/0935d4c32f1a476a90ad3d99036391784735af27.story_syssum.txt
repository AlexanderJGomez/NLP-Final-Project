"Two high school students came here, took off the sandals they were wearing and walked home barefoot," said Budhi Kurniawan, of the non-governmental organization SOS Children's Villages and who helped start the campaign after hearing about the case.
The boy's parents are also considering an appeal, he added.
The Child Protection Commission, however, said the parents had filed a complaint with the Palu police after the alleged victim, 1st Brig.
The parents, according to the commission, wanted a case filed against those policemen.
According to the Commission, in 2011 alone, 6,273 minors were reported to be serving time in jail, some of them in adult prisons.
We don't want minors in jail," Ihsan explained.
Public pressure from a similar campaign in 2009, "Coins for Prita," helped a housewife escape criminal liability for complaining in a private e-mail about a hospital's service.
