The goal of the discussion, for which Smiley deserves credit, is to bring much-deserved attention and aid to America's poor.
Worse, almost 20% of American children live in poverty.
For decades, America has wrestled with poverty but with little success.

In Washington, D.C., public schools, only 59% of high school students graduated on time in the 2010-2011 school year.

Today, it is more than 70% for blacks and more than 40% for all Americans.
The first step to alleviating poverty is to promote better schools, families and churches.
