Three new cases, including a fatality, were recorded in Saudi Arabia, the kingdom announced this week.
The other two cases, according to the health ministry, were in Saudi Arabia's eastern governorate of Al-Ahsa, where most cases of the disease have appeared.
A full genetic series, obtained from four infected cases in Al-Ahsa, was recorded in the gene bank, said ministry spokesman Dr. Khalid Marghlani.
Researchers can now start comparing the genetic sequences from these four recent Saudi patients to the genetic sequence from the first Saudi patient, which is also publicly available, he said.
In addition, fewer MERS infections have been seen in health care workers than during the SARS epidemic, the WHO said.
But the international organization called for caution, saying it is possible for the virus to move around the world.
