"All of this will pass on the 25th" he said, referring to Sunday's presidential election.
Very few imagine the other main contender, Yulia Tymoshenko, making a similar sacrifice.
Poroshenko's preference would be to keep Arseny Yatsenyuk as prime minister, not least because of the credibility he has established with the IMF and Western governments, while broadening the government to include former Party of the Regions people from the east.
Poroshenko's plans to visit the region in an early gesture of reconciliation will help, as will his willingness compromise on Russian language status.
With tax rises, wages freezes, spending cuts and large hikes in energy prices on the way under the economic reform program agreed with the IMF, the new president's honeymoon period won't extend very far into the autumn unless he can convince Ukrainians that the foundations of recovery are being built.
That is why coming to some kind of understanding with Russia will be another urgent priority for president Poroshenko.
But they are likely to cover things like Russian access to Ukraine's military-industrial facilities, new gas transit arrangements, the status of Crimea and perhaps an agreement that Ukraine will remain non-aligned.
Perhaps changing the weather would be easier after all.
