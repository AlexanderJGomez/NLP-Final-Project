The National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Kentucky, also said Saturday it and Chevrolet will restore three of the eight vehicles that the 45-foot-wide hole swallowed in February, but will leave the remains of the five others -- too wrecked to fix -- on display.
"That's no longer a naturally occurring, interesting sinkhole," she said.
Western Kentucky is cave country, and it turned out a previously undetected cave was under the Skydome, Frassinelli said.
By late April, visitors could walk into the Skydome and stand just feet from the hole's edge.
But their remains will continued to be displayed -- eventually back in the Skydome, where an exhibit will be dedicated to the sinkhole, the museum said.
Since the 'Vette's 1953 debut, more than 1.5 million have rolled off Chevrolet assembly lines.
