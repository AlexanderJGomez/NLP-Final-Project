It's Delta Air Lines' new "Basic Economy" fare, part of the airline's new five-fare class of pricing starting March 1.
Note the options on the other end of the seating spectrum: The first-class cabin will be split into "First Class" for domestic routes and "Delta One" for long-haul international and certain cross-country domestic flights.
In the main cabin, customers will have choice of the "Basic Economy" fare and two other fare classes.
The "Delta Comfort+" coach fare on all flights will include priority boarding and dedicated overhead bin space, alcoholic drinks, premium snacks, premium entertainment, up to 4 more inches of legroom and quilted seat covers.
And who will guard that dedicated overhead bin space for "Delta Comfort+" travelers, Hobica asks.
The routes the new fare is offered on are now clearly defined, but are still fairly limited."
That pricing structure seems Spirit-esque."
