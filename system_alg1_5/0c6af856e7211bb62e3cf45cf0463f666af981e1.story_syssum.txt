Netanyahu himself, in an interview on NBC, tried to qualify his words about a two-state solution, saying what he meant to say was that a Palestinian state was not viable under present conditions.
He knows that stance is totally unacceptable to Israel's chief ally, the United States, and to the rest of the international community.
Now, as he constructs a coalition of ultranationalists and ultra-Orthodox, those shields have been stripped away.
Whatever he says about the two-state solution, the next Netanyahu government is virtually certain to blast ahead with settlement-building.
Netanyahu's statement was a moment of truth for him, for Israel and for the world.
Now, the world must hold him to account.
