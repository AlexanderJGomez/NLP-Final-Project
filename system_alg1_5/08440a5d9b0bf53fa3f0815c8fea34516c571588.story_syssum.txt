Only women will be allowed into the distributions sites to collect the food, WFP said.
The distribution sites will be set up with proper security, making it difficult for those not entitled to receive food to enter, he said.
The food aid plan involves at least eight private humanitarian agencies: Samaritan's Purse, Catholic Relief Services, CARE, World Vision, ACTED, Save The Children, GOAL and ADRA.
Multinational troops, including the U.S. military, will help secure food convoys and the distribution sites, Prior said.
