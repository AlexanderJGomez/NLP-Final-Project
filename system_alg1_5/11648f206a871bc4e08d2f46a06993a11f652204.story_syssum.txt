Some analysts say the developments make Obama's "doctrine" more clear than ever.
"Barack Obama has been a lethal president," says Fawaz Gerges of the London School of Economics and Political Science.
"The Obama Doctrine, when it comes to al Qaeda and its extremist allies, is really a kill strategy," Gerges says.
After a large-scale chemical attack which the U.S. blamed on al-Assad's regime, "it was all about the credibility of the president," Gerges says.
"In the sense that the word has typically been used to describe a president's vision for managing national security challenges around the world, I don't think Obama has a doctrine," says Pletka, who identifies herself as conservative.
But if Obama doesn't have a so-called doctrine, that just might be a good thing, according to some analysts.
"The search itself is misguided," CNN's Fareed Zakaria wrote in 2011.
"Beyond al Qaeda, there is no Obama Doctrine," he says.
During a recent speech to the U.N. General Assembly, Obama did not mention East Asia except for a single reference to China in regard to Iran, Bremmer says.
