Bill Maher took it a step further on his HBO show "Real Time," calling those who have yet to make up their minds in the presidential election "ignorant."
The notion that the final month of the election may not matter is, well, ignorant.
Presidential debates can make a difference.
Same thing in 2004.
Recently, 40% of Americans "say they are not too or not at all satisfied, marking the lowest level of candidate satisfaction since the 1992 presidential election."
CNN's Halimah Abdullah took a look at these "slivers" of voters.
Like the unsatisfied voters, there is a group of voters who haven't started to pay attention to the race.
Similarly, in the 2008 race, 15% of the voters made their decision in the last month, with more than 50% going for Obama.
These are the persuadable voters.
Certainly, Romney's victory in the primary was one.
It would be surprising if Obama doesn't allude to Romney's comment in some way, even if in passing.
Back in late February was the "season finale" of the primary debates, which in retrospect seemed like the ultimate reality show with more twists and turns than a "Real Housewives" reunion.
