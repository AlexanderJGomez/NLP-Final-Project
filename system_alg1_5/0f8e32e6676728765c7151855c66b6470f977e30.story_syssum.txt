But on the morning of the scheduled vote, Rep. Steve Israel, a member of Democratic leadership, said the riders in bill have become a "poison pill" against Democratic support that the GOP majority needs for the measure to pass.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said the provisions were "destructive to middle class families and to the practice to our democracy" and demanded they be stripped out of the bill.
Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second ranking Democrats who is in charge of counting votes, said he didn't know if he would support the compromise or how many Democrats would.
He called the Dodd-Frank provisions "awful."
"The Congress is very concerned about taxpayer funding of political activities," Boehner said.
Democratic aides say it's still early to gauge how many members will vote no on Thursday, but acknowledge that the deal was brokered by Democrats and Republicans over several weeks.
Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen, a top Pelosi deputy, said he's voting no, and described the opposition as "running deep and getting deeper" as more Democrats review the details.
"If Rep. Pelosi doesn't think her negotiators did a good job, she should discuss it with them - but sour grapes doesn't mean she gets to rewrite the deal after the fact," Michael Steel said in a statement to CNN.
