(CNN) -- Belgium set a date with the U.S. in the last 16 of the World Cup as the curtain fell on the gripping group stages in Brazil, while Algeria celebrated a historic first.
But if the statistics tell us anything about Belgium, it is never count them out.
Aleksandr Kokorin, who is nicknamed "Bieber" because of his youthful similarity to the Canadian pop star, was soon on song.
But Algeria, cheered on by the undiminished enthusiasm of their fans, were not done yet.
Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo, Spain's defending champions and 2006 winners Italy were among the big guns saying adeus from Brazil.
