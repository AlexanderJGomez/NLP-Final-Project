"This could be one of the most devastating tornado outbreaks in the nation's history by the time it's over," CNN Meteorologist Sean Morris said.
"It was certainly a rare day that there were so many tornadoes that caused so much damage in populated areas," CNN Meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said.
"It is tornado season, but an intensive event like this only will occur maybe once or twice a year," Morris said.
"When you have a storm all by itself like we saw yesterday, that's when you get this structure," he added.
"We may finish out April with more than 300 tornadoes," Carbin said.
The numbers for April are definitely on a record pace."
