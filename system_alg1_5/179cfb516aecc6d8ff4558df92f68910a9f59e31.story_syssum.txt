(CNN) -- Football's world governing body, FIFA, has officially sanctioned the wearing of religious headscarves.
Until now, some slogans have been allowed but a blanket ban will now be imposed.
This will apply from June 1 and will be in force for the World Cup," FIFA secretary general, Jerome Valcke said.
The simplest rule for the image of the game is to start from the basis that slogans will not be allowed," said Alex Horne, general secretary of the English Football Association.
