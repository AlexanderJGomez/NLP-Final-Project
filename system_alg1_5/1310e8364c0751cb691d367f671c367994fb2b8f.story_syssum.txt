While Chrysler dealers will be "forced out" by June 9, GM is positioning for a smoother closing of its stores, with each shutting down when it runs out of inventory.
Unlike Chrysler's announcement, GM's list of closing dealers will not be made public, leaving that decision to each dealer.
After that time, Chrysler will no longer pay those dealers for warranty work.
GM's dealer announcement is a different story, since the company isn't releasing the names of the closing dealers.
Some economists, however, believe that the impact will be less than expected, since dealers typically have a high turnover rate and technician jobs were in a short supply already.
Both Chrysler and GM have expressed interest to shrink their dealer base.
But, even after these reductions by Chrysler and GM, they still have more dealers than other manufacturers.
But after June 9, the selected Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge dealers will have to take down their signs.
