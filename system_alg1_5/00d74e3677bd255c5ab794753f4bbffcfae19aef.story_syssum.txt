(CNN) -- Comprehensive immigration reform.
It never came up on the campaign trail.
It's fixing the legal system so it works for the future -- for immigrants and the U.S. economy.
But most contentious is not the same as most important.
The two existing programs for low-skilled temporary workers are for seasonal labor only: farmhands, landscaping crews, summer and winter resort workers.
But we do.
On the contrary, for the most part, it's because Americans are doing better than in decades past.
And meanwhile, far from shrinking, the demand for low-skilled labor is growing over time.
No, we don't need as many immigrant workers in a down economy -- and far fewer want to come to the U.S. when jobs are scarce.
Without it, there can be no successful immigration law enforcement.
As long as there are jobs available, foreigners will want to come to work here.
Now if only Obama would mention it.
