Here, I am meeting the former mayor Willie Brown.
San Francisco must surely be the most beautiful of cities.
The unemployment rate, at 10.2%, is the third highest in the country.
In May the Governor of California, Jerry Brown, announced the deficit was $16 billion.
Think about it.
California is as much a victim of this as any European country.
What I am suggesting is that the European austerity, which so far has not hit most of America, has well and truly arrived.
