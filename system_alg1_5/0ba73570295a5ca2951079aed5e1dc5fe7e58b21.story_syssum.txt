Then the terror began.
A student in the room told Alex Kubasu, a reporter with CNN affiliate Citizen TV, that the terrorists sprayed bullets indiscriminately, striking his thigh.
Some ran.
By then, 147 people were dead and plans were "underway to evacuate students and other affected persons," the Kenya National Disaster Operation Centre tweeted.
"It is a very sad day for Kenya," Nkaissery said.
She escaped unscathed, but a few of her friends did not.
Such terrorism, sadly, isn't new to the people of eastern Kenya.
Such an attack is more reminiscent of what other Islamist extremist groups, the Pakistani Taliban and Boko Haram, did in respectively attacking a school in Peshawar, Pakistan, and kidnapping more than 200 girls at a school in Chibok, Nigeria.
As of this spring, the school had schools of education, information science, and arts and social sciences.
