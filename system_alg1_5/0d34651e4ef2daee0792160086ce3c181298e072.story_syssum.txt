Regardless of the other candidates' performances in New Hampshire or even what happens in the South Carolina primary next week, Mitt Romney is extremely likely to be the Republican nominee.
From 1980 to the present, no candidate who significantly trailed in party endorsements has won the nomination.
But no candidate has succeeded when significantly trailing by that measure.
On top of this, Republican pundits almost universally condemned Gingrich.
Rick Perry.
Tim Pawlenty and Perry.
Pawlenty's campaign was low on cash.
Still, Perry remains the only candidate besides Romney with nontrivial support from Republican elites.
If he could somehow manage to run a respectable campaign and win a substantial number of votes in South Carolina, he would be Romney's only halfway plausible threat.
