Washington (CNN) -- The Department of Defense announced Tuesday that capital charges have been refiled against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other alleged co-conspirators in the September 11, 2001, conspiracy to allow prosecution before a military commission at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, naval base.
In military terminology he is the convening authority of the military commissions, the equivalent of a civilian criminal court.
But after widespread opposition across the political platform, the president announced earlier this year all prosecutions would be in military courts in Guantanamo.
However, it remains open due to legal complexities involving the status of some detainees and congressional opposition to holding trials for high-profile suspects in U.S. criminal courts.
