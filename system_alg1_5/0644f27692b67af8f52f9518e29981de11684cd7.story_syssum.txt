(CNN) -- From "Mississippi Masala" to "Vanity Fair," Mira Nair's movies have entranced audiences in India and the West.
I read "Namesake" while in huge grief with the death of a beloved person to me [Mira's mother in law].
CNN: It's filmed in both India and New York, such different cultures.
That flow -- that see-saw between parents and children, that's what "The Namesake" is about.
Nair: Well, Kal Penn plays Gogol and he's known as a comic star, but I had no idea that he existed until my 15-year-old son said, "This has to be your Gogol."
Nair: It's not that different a kind of audience, that's what pleases me.
CNN: "The Namesake" was filmed in America and India.
Nair: I am at home in many cultures.
Nair: No, not really.
