Let's take the record of my country, Uganda, and its Anti-Homosexuality Act.
Although the Constitutional Court invalidated the anti-homosexuality law, it did so on a procedural point, not on the grounds of human rights.
But if supporters of this law reintroduce it, or if it is appealed, we will fight it every step of the way again.
Sadly, human rights violations in Uganda are not limited to the government's prejudicial and irrational treatment of LGBT people.
I love my country, Uganda, and don't mean to focus on it unfairly.
But to make this summit truly historic, the United States and African nations must work together to promote democracies rooted in national constitutions and human rights, committed to protecting the dignity of all their citizens.
