A petition created a few years ago calls on Amazon to change the name of the program from "Amazon Mom" to "Amazon Family."
In 2013, Miller called on men and women to sign the petition to get Amazon to change the name of the program.
"Someone actually started a petition to change the name to 'Amazon Family' in the US, and so far it has less than 100 signatures.
Miller, of Owings Mills, Maryland, died Saturday.
Buzz Bishop, a father of two in Calgary, Alberta, and founder of the blog Dad Camp, points out how Amazon calls its program "Amazon Family" in Germany, Japan, Austria, France and Canada as well as the United Kingdom.
"We are continuing a cause that was once championed by the creator of the Dad Bloggers Facebook group, Oren Miller," wrote Bishop.
Do you think Amazon should re-name its "Amazon Mom" program "Amazon Family"?
