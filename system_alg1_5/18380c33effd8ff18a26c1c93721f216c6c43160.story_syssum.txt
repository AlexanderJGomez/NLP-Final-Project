Megan Kanka's killer, Jesse Timmendequas, is among eight men whose sentences were commuted to life.
Among the eight is Jesse Timmendequas, 46, who was sentenced to death in June 1997 for Megan's murder.
"It's a day of progress for the state of New Jersey and for the millions of people across our nation and around the globe who reject the death penalty as a moral or practical response to the grievous, even heinous, crime of murder," Corzine said.
Since the Supreme Court's reinstatement of the death penalty, almost 1,100 people have been executed in 37 states.
According to the Death Penalty Information Center, which opposes capital punishment, New Jersey joins 13 states and the District of Columbia that do not use execution as a means of punishment.
