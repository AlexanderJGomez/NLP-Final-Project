The four trucks, under heavy security, crossed the border from Chaman in Pakistan's Balochistan province.
Imran Khan, founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (Movement for Justice) party, lambasted the decision to reopen the routes, saying it was done without meeting conditions set forth by Parliament.
Under Tuesday's announcements, Pakistan agreed not to impose any transit fee with the reopened routes, Clinton said in a statement.
Pakistan had been seeking $5,000 per truck as a condition of reopening the supply lines, which the United States refused to pay.
Meanwhile, the Pakistani Taliban has threatened to attack NATO trucks, saying the supplies are used to target its members fighting against occupation in Afghanistan.
