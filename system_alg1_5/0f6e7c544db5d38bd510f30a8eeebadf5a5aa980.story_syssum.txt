WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The United States ambassador to Afghanistan, William Wood, said Friday that changes in communications with Afghan military forces have been made in the aftermath of a disputed U.S. air raid on an Afghan village.
"People who are reviewing our findings have been in Afghanistan for a while, and I don't know when they will complete their review," Wood said at the State Department late Friday.
"Steps are already not simply under way but have been taken to improve coordination," he said.
"The United States delegation expressed regret over the loss of any innocent civilian lives incurred during security operations," the statement said.
