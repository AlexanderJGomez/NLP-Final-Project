San Diego, California (CNN) -- Nearly six years ago, I left Texas to move back home to California.
That will be second only to California, which has 55 electoral votes.
It is a much bleaker story in Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan and Massachusetts, which lost seats.
You go to Austin, Houston or San Antonio.
Texas is the second-largest state in area, behind Alaska.
But in terms of population growth, it's second to none.
Texas is still a red state, but there is some evidence that it's trending purple.
First, much of it is coming from transplants from blue states such as California.
The same goes for Arizona, Florida and Nevada.
And in Texas, Hispanics will likely account for nearly 40 percent of the state's population.
Welcome to the new America.
