When it comes to college basketball, the first month of spring ushers in a frantic slew of games to determine seedings for one of the most fervently watched sporting events in the U.S., known simply as the NCAA Tournament, or more often, March Madness.
"When you go to college, maybe your number one goal before you graduate is you want to be able to play in the NCAA tournament," says Bryce Drew, head coach and former player at Valparaiso University in Indiana (28-5, Horizon League champions).
His father, Homer Drew, was Valparaiso's coach at the time, and his brother Scott (now men's basketball coach at Baylor University) was an assistant, completing the Hollywood scenario.
After all, the last time a Valparaiso graduate dribbled a basketball in the NBA was in 1956.
"It definitely helps an agent to learn how a player will perform under a national stage," says Jared Karnes, co-founder of A3 Athletics agency in Knoxville, Tennessee.
"A lot of times they've had to work their way into the spotlight, and so they develop a hard work ethic," he says.
"A lot of guys can score and shoot, but when you get to the NBA, really being able to defend someone separates you."
"Even though they are so wildly successful as a team (now,) Butler right before that wasn't well known," says Karnes, adding that it was Hayward who first put it on the map.
Led by 6-foot-10-inch Jamaican senior Vashil Fernandez (five blocked shots against Green Bay in the Horizon League tournament final) and 6' 9" sophomore Alec Peters, the Crusaders are hoping for a high seed when a 10-member committee meets this "Selection Sunday" to rank the tournament's 68 participants.
"You talk about these smaller schools that are out there, we're that way as a boutique agency," he says.
