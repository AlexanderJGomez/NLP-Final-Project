"Across the board they thought it was ugly," said Shea Munroe, who sorts the art and collectibles donated at Goodwill Industries in Federal Way, Washington.
Its title is "Reflection" or "Reflections," from "The Cycles of Life Suite," and the art is signed by Dali and numbered "126/150."
"This is probably the real deal," Munroe said of her discovery of the Dali work.
An appraiser retained by Goodwill also confirmed the authenticity of the Dali, and the charitable organization also ensured the art wasn't stolen, said Amanda Bedell, spokeswoman for Goodwill in Tacoma, Washington.
"We don't know the background of what the circumstances were," Bedell said of the donation.
"We have a very busy donation door, and we have several people who work that door," Munroe said, explaining how the donor was able to remain unknown.
The bidding for the Dali piece is still short of the most prized art auctioned by Goodwill: A Frank Weston Benson oil painting, dated 1924 and also donated anonymously, was sold online by Goodwill in 2006 for $165,002.
