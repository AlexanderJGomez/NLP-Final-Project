Beijing, China (CNN) -- In a round-table meeting with government advisers and researchers of a government-run think tank on April 14, Premier Wen Jiabao enjoined them to listen to people's voices and relay these truthfully to top leaders.
"I don't think it is in contradiction to the party's crackdown on dissents," says Wenfang Tang, a political science professor at Ohio University.
"They are not complacent," says a retired Communist Party official, who declined to be identified.
They do not care what other people and countries will say."
"Their calculation is that if the government can keep the economy growing and jobs and wages increasing, the legitimacy of the CCP will be maintained," says China-watcher Drew Thompson.
The solution, he replied, was political reform--but reform that is gradual and led by the Communist Party.
Instead, says the retired Communist Party official, "he advocates transparency and accountability so as to effectively solve problems, avoid chaos and consolidate the Party's leadership."

Some observers wonder if Wen's pronouncement is just part of a "good cop, bad cop" charade, with Wen playing the reform-minded leader and President Hu Jintao playing the hard liner.
