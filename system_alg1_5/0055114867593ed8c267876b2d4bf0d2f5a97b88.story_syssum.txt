Robert Bales pleaded guilty in June to more than 30 criminal charges, including 16 premeditated murder counts.
Yes, Bob will apologize," Bales' lawyer, John Henry Browne said in an e-mail to CNN.
There's not a good reason in the world for the horrible things I did," Bales said when he pleaded guilty, according to Drew Mikkelson of CNN affilliate KING, who was tweeting from the courtroom.
Another witness broke down on the stand and cried out: "For God's sake, don't ask me any more questions," Mikkelson wrote.
Bales is a member of the Army's 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, an element of the 2nd Infantry Division.
