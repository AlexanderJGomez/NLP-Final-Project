But last week brought a bombshell that shook the proceedings: Matt Sandusky, 33, was now willing to testify that the man he first met through the Second Mile charity repeatedly molested him while he was a child, according to Matt Sandusky's lawyers.
"I mean for my family so that they can really have closure and see what the truth actually is," Matt Sandusky said.
Matt Sandusky, a foster child formally adopted at 18, also described Jerry Sandusky rubbing, hugging and showering with him.
It was only days before the commonwealth rested, and after some alleged victims had testified, according to Matt Sandusky's lawyers, that he told them he was abused and wanted to cooperate with prosecutors.
By not putting Jerry Sandusky on the stand, the defense ensured that Matt Sandusky would not testify.
Jerry Sandusky's defense team was asked to turn over its copy of the tape, but it will remain available to them.
Karl Rominger, another defense attorney, had a jailhouse visit with Jerry Sandusky on Monday.
"I didn't do it," he said, according to Rominger.
Others don't talk to him at all," according to Rominger.
