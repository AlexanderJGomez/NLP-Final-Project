Unfunded pension debt, which in Detroit stands at $3.5 billion and is roughly one-sixth of the city's total debt, is a national problem that has already put other city and state governments on the same road to insolvency.
New York City, for instance, is much worse off than Detroit, with some $69.9 billion in pension debts.
In Pennsylvania, the unfunded total in the state's two pension funds is $47 billion.
In Illinois, for instance, Gov.
While the problem is already enormous, it will only get worse in the coming years unless governments transition to defined contribution systems, like the 401(k).
In the case of defined benefit plans, Detroit shows that taxpayers may not always be able to pay what the government promises.
Unfortunately, Detroit's public pensioners will likely pay this bill themselves when their pensions are cut in bankruptcy proceedings.
If governments across the nation seize the moment and make the change to a defined contribution system -- as Pennsylvania is poised to do this fall -- they'll save their citizens from a fate like Detroit's, where opportunity and prosperity have been replaced by bankruptcy and hoped-for bailouts.
