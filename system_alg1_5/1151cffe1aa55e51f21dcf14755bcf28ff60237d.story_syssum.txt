Za'atari refugee camp, Jordan (CNN) -- I've spent the past week working in the Za'atari refugee camp in northern Jordan, about six miles from the Syrian border.
Over 20,000 Syrian refugees have moved into Za'atari camp already, and the pace of new arrivals to the camp has more than doubled, with more than 14,000 arriving in the past week alone.
Yesterday, I met many newly-arrived refugees, some just children, who told me how had they witnessed family members and neighbors being killed in Syria.
Wasfeyah, a refugee mother of five children, told me that when her family was trying to escape to Jordan, they were shot at and her eldest son, Ali, was hit in the head by a bullet.
Nearly half of the camps' residents are children, and there is next to nothing for children to do here.
They are hard to miss in the camp -- just follow the unexpected sound of laughter and you will find swarms of kids singing, swinging, sliding and occasionally arguing over who's turn it is.
Currently, they receive hot, pre-cooked meals that are distributed throughout the camp, but now communal kitchens are being built so families can cook for themselves.
One mother told me, "not even a camel could live in this place, it is so hot and dusty."
Many anticipate it will be a long haul, but all of us, especially the Syrians here, are hopeful they can return soon.
