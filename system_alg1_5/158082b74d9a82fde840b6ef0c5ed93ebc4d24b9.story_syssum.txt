Harry Patch, pictured here on November 11, 2008, at an Armistice Day commemoration ceremony in London.
Born in 1898, Patch became a plumber before being conscripted to the army in 1916.
After the war, Harry returned to his work as a plumber and later became a sanitary engineer.
Patch didn't speak about the war until he turned 100, the Ministry of Defence said.
"In speaking about his experiences, Harry began at last to come to terms with his war, and was at peace with himself and his memories," the Defence Ministry said.
Patch returned to Belgium in 2002, something he had said he would never do, and laid a wreath to his battalion, the Defence Ministry said.
Patch wrote a book detailing his life in 2007, called "The Last Fighting Tommy."
"While the country may remember Harry as a soldier, we will remember him as a dear friend," said Jim Ross, a close friend.
