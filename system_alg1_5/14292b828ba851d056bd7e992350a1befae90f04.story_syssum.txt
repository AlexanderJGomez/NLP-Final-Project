Sidiqi, once captured, "started to talk a lot," and detailed a "Mumbai-style" attack in Europe, the German official said.
Sidiqi was part of Atta's circle, the official said.
Meanwhile, a federal law enforcement official in the United States, said "the volume seems to be turned up" on the threat information coming out of Europe.
This source says the potential operatives may be a mix of Europeans and others possibly including North Africans, Pakistanis, Turks, Uzbeks, and Tajiks.
"We would be remiss not to try to take action to thwart what might be under way in Europe," said the official.
According to the official, the mix of threats remains the same.
The threats they pose are "all deadly," said the official.
