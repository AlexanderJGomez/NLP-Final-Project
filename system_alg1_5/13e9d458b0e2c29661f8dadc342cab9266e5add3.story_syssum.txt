But, according to authorities in Jefferson Parish, his account of practicing "WWE"-style wrestling moves by punching, jumping on and slamming his 5-year-old half-sister to the bed was all too real, and fatal.
The juvenile suspect initially said he found Viloude lying in the bathroom, complaining of a stomachache, authorities said.
The 13-year-old, who is 5 feet, 5 inches tall and weighs 100 pounds, told an investigator about punching his half-sister in the stomach several times and slamming her on the bed, authorities said.
"Additionally, he jumped on the victim and struck her with his elbow several times like the wrestlers do on television," the sheriff's office statement said.
WWE, the Connecticut-based World Wrestling Entertainment, in a statement Wednesday called the girl's death a tragedy.
The mother will not face charges, according to Fortunato.
