The memo went out earlier this week as part of an effort to reform the student visa system, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
His lawyer, Robert Stahl, told CNN his client had not been attending classes on a regular basis, as required by his visa.
"The fact that a foreign national was able to re-enter the U.S. with what appeared to be a valid student visa, while Customs and Border Protection officers were unaware that his visa status had become invalid, represents a serious hole in our national security," McCaul told CNN.
"It's surprising that the administration isn't already verifying that any student coming into the country has a valid student visa," Grassley said.
Grassley sent a letter and list of questions Friday to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, asking her about the apparent visa lapse with Tazhayakov and other possible loopholes.
