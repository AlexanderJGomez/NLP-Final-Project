The term brogrammer is a joke, of course.
In 1999, Google's Marissa Mayer almost didn't take the job at the all-male start-up because there were more women at another firm that made her an offer.
If you're a woman, it's not you.
It's a red flag for women engineers, product developers, designers, project managers, marketers, business development and PR specialists.
Established companies with executives who are vocal about women's issues, such as Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, also have an advantage.
Most of the time, they simply don't know any better.
And there's a bonus: Onlookers have real life examples of what not to do at their companies.
Instead, they're superheroes, the protagonist in epic movies and biographies.
That's a good thing.
