And dangerous.
And nuts.
Meanwhile, at least Republicans aren't going full-political-stunt and impeaching President Obama ... yet.
Republicans bash President Obama for issuing executive orders.
But facts, schmacts.
For his part, President Obama said, "I'm not interested in photo ops, I'm interested in solving a problem."
Then, when pressing Congress to pass immigration reform, President Obama went to the border and ... Republicans criticized him for doing so.
Republicans damn President Obama he does it and damned if he doesn't.
That's what all presidents do.
Republicans are the ones who aren't doing their jobs.
