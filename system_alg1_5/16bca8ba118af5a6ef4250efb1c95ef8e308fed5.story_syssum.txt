"It is impossible for us to remain indifferent to the developments there," Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said.
However, when this turns into a big wave, it also has the potential to become a regional and an international matter."
"The continued violence, multiday curfews and military lockdowns are restricting access to basic goods and services, such as health care, medicines and food, causing great concern for the situation of children, the elderly, the sick and wounded, as well as refugees and other vulnerable groups.
That policy has been challenged by the Syrian situation.
Of the refugees, 4,368 are children, and 73 Syrians are now being treated in Turkish hospitals, the emergency directorate said.
Many of the refugees have fled from a region that includes the northwestern town of Jisr al-Shugur, seized by the Syrian military over the weekend, a network of human rights activists said.
Adnan Mahmoud, the information minister, said the Cabinet urged citizens "who were forced to leave their homes to come back after calm and security were restored in the area," SANA said.
Wissam Tarif, a human rights activist based outside Syria, said he had not received reports of people returning to their homes.
"Arbitrary arrests, detention and torture, including of protestors, of human rights defenders, of representatives of the media, political dissidents, and young children must cease immediately," the statement said.
