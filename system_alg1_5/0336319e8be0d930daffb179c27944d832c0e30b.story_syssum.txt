But, as Mark Woodman, the president of the Color Marketing Group points out, a color as bold as orange is never gone for good.
Especially in its brighter spectrum, orange is considered fun, upbeat and unique, he said.
"As leaves change color, we are introduced to a collection of reds, browns, golds and, of course, oranges.
"In the end, orange has been embraced by so many that we won't want to see it go," Woodman said.
These things can be replaced (more) easily and effortlessly than, say, an expensive orange couch or chair.
I fell in love with the color, too, and wanted it somewhere else in our home.
While it's not for everyone, I have to say that I love it."
