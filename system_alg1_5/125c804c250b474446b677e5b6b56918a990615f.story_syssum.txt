The strike began February 18, running from Monday to Friday, and Iberia said it lost about $19 million that week.
Unions are now threatening to extend the strike to the lucrative Easter Week, which they had previously said would be off limits.
"There could be a strike during Easter Week and there could be an indefinite strike every Monday and Friday," Manuel Atienza, of the General Workers Union (UGT), told CNN on Monday.
Unions have criticized the downsizing of Iberia, which has already seen the elimination of flights from Madrid to Athens, Cairo and Istanbul.
