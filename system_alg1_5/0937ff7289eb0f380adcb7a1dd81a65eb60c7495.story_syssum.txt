Nine other countries, together accounting for more than half the euro area's GDP, were downgraded at least one notch.
The average fiscal deficit for the euro area was only about 4% of GDP in 2011.
The answer is surely no.
Further, Europe's investment funds and insurance companies cannot all put their money in a bank account where yields are close to nothing.
But the area's investors dare not cross the Alps to spend their money in the southern countries such as Italy, Spain and Greece (and maybe soon France).
But the ECB has its limits too.
This should be the main priority of Europe's leaders.
