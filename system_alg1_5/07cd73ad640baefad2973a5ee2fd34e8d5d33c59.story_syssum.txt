"Any hasty new adoptions would risk permanently breaking up families, causing long-term damage to already vulnerable children, and could distract from aid efforts in Haiti," the agencies said in a joint statement.
Save the Children Chief Executive Jasmine Whitbread said the "vast majority" of children on their own in Haiti are not orphans, but were simply separated from their families in the chaos.
The poverty in Haiti already makes children there "extremely vulnerable" to exploitation and abuse, Byworth said.
For those who want to help Haitian children, Whitbread said, they should donate to aid agencies who are working on reuniting those children with their families.
