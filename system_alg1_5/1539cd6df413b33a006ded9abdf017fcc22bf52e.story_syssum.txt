McGinley, a three-time Ryder Cup winner as a player, captained McIlroy at the Seve Trophy in 2009, when Great Britain and Ireland played against Continental Europe.
"He's been vice captain a few times, he's holed the winning putt in the Ryder Cup.
Along with McIlroy, both were instrumental in Montgomerie's winning turn at Celtic Manor in Wales in 2010 but none of the trio think the legendary Scot should be appointed again.

The announcement will be made after a 15-man committee that includes Montgomerie, Clarke and McGinley meets to decide.
