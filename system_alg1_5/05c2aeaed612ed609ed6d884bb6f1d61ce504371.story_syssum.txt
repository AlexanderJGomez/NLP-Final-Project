"We are keeping the news away from her," Khan said.
But Khan and Shaikh said they are nevertheless "hoping the Chinese government will show some compassion."
Britain too has asked China not to execute Shaikh.
During the trial, the defendant has been guaranteed his legal rights," Jiang Yu, spokeswoman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said last week.
He would be the first European Union citizen executed in China in 50 years, Reprieve said.
"We deeply regret that mental health concerns had no bearing on the final judgment despite requests by Mr. Shaikh's defense lawyer and repeated calls by the prime minister, ministers, members of the opposition, as well as [the] European Union," the British Foreign Office said last week.
Once there, Shaikh was introduced to another man called Okole, who told him he owned a nightclub in China where they would launch his singing career.
He said British consular staff told him court officials had been "bemused and amused" by Shaikh's "incoherent" testimony.
Schaapveld also examined hundreds of pages of rambling e-mails sent by Shaikh to the British Embassy in Poland and various public figures, including then-U.S. President George W. Bush and former Beatle Paul McCartney.
