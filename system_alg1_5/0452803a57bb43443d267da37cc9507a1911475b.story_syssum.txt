In August 2000, a jury in Oklahoma found Lockett guilty of first-degree murder, rape, forcible oral sodomy, kidnapping and a bevy of other charges -- 19 in all.
So in the case of Lockett, the state of Oklahoma tested a new combination of chemicals.
Like I said, if anyone deserved the death penalty, it was Lockett, but the real debate is whether we need to be in the business of trying to find the least cruel and least unusual way to kill anyone voluntarily.
Not at all.
But we simply cannot, and should not, act quickly.
Think of how many innocent people we have executed, when the number should be zero.
The excruciatingly long, and necessary, appeals process in death penalty cases cost taxpayers millions for each case, and it draws resources away from other important prosecutions.
It would be worth the price, if that was what it took to get justice.
I've tried death penalty cases, and I've been lucky: None of my clients has ever been sent to death row.
Often, they are left, instead, with unresolved emptiness.
The death penalty is flawed in every conceivable way, and it should be abolished.
