"I know it's not easy," he said.
After the 30-minute meeting, Obama said he wanted to send a strong message that the partnership between the nations would continue.
"All of that makes America safer, and we are going to keep them on the run," he said.
And together, with our partners, we will prevail.
Obama's trip began in secrecy, with the president leaving his Camp David retreat.
A senior administration official said Obama told Karzai that some progress had been made, particularly involving local governance, establishing more credible national institutions and battling corruption.
Gibbs said Afghan authorities were notified of Obama's trip on Thursday.
In addition, NATO partners have more than 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, according to the officials.
The trip is Obama's second to Afghanistan.
On that visit, part of a broader trip to the Middle East, Obama traveled to eastern Afghanistan to meet with U.S. forces and also met with Karzai.
