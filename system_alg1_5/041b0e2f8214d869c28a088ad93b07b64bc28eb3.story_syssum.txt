On Monday, the president for the first time commented publicly on the Supreme Court's deliberations.
The president may say he is confident the court will uphold the law, but it seems he's not entirely optimistic.
If the law is overturned, they will need to come up with a comprehensive alternative.
They can start by telling voters, in the words of the Cato scholar Doug Bandow, that "ObamaCare represents extraordinary federal overreach, a bid to legislate well beyond Congress' constitutional powers."
For most Americans, health care is like plumbing: They know they need it; they don't truly know how it works, but they definitely know when it's not working.
If ObamaCare is rejected by the court, it would present a huge opportunity for Republicans.
