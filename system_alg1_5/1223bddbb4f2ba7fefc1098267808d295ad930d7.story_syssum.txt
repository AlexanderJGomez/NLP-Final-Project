She hopes to be back on Leno's show in a few years with an Oscar, Lohan said.
If convicted, Lohan could face up to a year in jail.
"I was kind of shocked, I didn't really expect the outcome to be what it was, but I'm a big girl and I'm going to do what I'm told to do, continue on with working in my life and I'm taking responsibility," she said.
"Being young and being in a position that I was in, you don't really take the time to appreciate what you have, and it's all kind of a whirlwind and people make decisions for you," she said.
"Hopefully, sitting here after winning an Oscar," Lohan said.
