Maybe not.
The technology is available.
Let's break it down.
Radar is reliable, but it is limited.
In these cases, air traffic controllers see only a blip on radar screens.
• Nearly 30 minutes after takeoff, the plane sends a text via satellite that confirms it's headed to Beijing, as expected.
• Later, an orbiting satellite checks in with the plane's satellite transceiver, kind of like a cell tower pinging a mobile phone.
In the wake of the tragedy, some called for airlines to modify their transponders to prevent anyone from being able to shut them off in flight.
We might know more about what happened to MH370 if air traffic controllers used orbiting satellites to track airliners, instead of radar.
But still, when an aircraft flies over the ocean, it will be out of range.
If all airliners were equipped this way, we could know a flight was in trouble even if the crew could not communicate by other means.
Possibly.
Unfortunately, we may never know for sure.
