COPD symptoms include shortness of breath, coughing, and fatigue.
The research, from the government-funded Women's Health Study, included 39,876 women 45 years and older who were free of COPD before they were randomly assigned to take a placebo, vitamin E supplements (600 IU every other day) or aspirin (100 mg per day), either alone or in combination.
The idea that vitamin E can reduce the risk of developing COPD is "biologically plausible," says Yvonne Kelly, Ph.D., an associate professor in the department of epidemiology and public health at University College London.
He points out that people with asthma may think they have COPD, or vice versa, since the symptoms are similar.
Currently, no vitamin supplements are recommended to prevent or treat COPD.
The daily recommended intake of vitamin E is about 22 international units for those 14 and older, and is relatively easy to obtain from oils such as sunflower, almonds, peanut butter, and spinach.
For people concerned about their lung health, taking vitamin E and C is not a bad idea, says Blumberg.
Supplements of beta-carotene, which is a precursor of the antioxidant vitamin A, should be used with caution, however.
