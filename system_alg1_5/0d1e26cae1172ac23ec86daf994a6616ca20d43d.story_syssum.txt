Sebelius became the 44th governor of the state of Kansas in 2003.
But the governor has paid her political dues, with stints as a Kansas state representative and state insurance commissioner.
"Mark my words, Sebelius will be on everyone's VP short list in 2008," Democratic blogger Markos Moulitsas said on his Daily Kos Web site, as he applauded her 2006 success in wooing disaffected Kansas Republicans.
When Sebelius was elected governor, Kansas faced a judicial order to increase school spending in the midst of its worst budget crisis since the 1930s.
So far, Sebelius has downplayed the scenario.
Last year, she took on a high-profile national assignment, serving as chairwoman of the Democratic Governors Association.
