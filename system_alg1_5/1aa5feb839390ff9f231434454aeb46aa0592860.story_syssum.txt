Google, which assured them it is focused on software, not hardware, seemed like a logical partner.
Then, when the company's intentions to buy Motorola surfaced, Google execs said they were mainly doing so in order to protect themselves and their partners against patent litigation.
He told an audience in South Korea on Tuesday that the acquisition will "not change in any material way the way we operate," and then told a group in Taipei, Taiwan, on Wednesday that Google plans to continue providing legal defenses to Android partners, according to Reuters.
"Google is a great software company, but they are not a consumer brand," he said.
Google has suggested that it plans to leverage Motorola's hardware expertise in order to understand how to integrate software more closely with hardware, Kevin Packingham, the senior vice president for Samsung Electronics products, said in an interview.
Even more so than Motorola, Samsung has been very close with Google over the last two years.
Andy Rubin, Google's head of mobile, said during a Google conference call in August announcing the Motorola acquisition that the new unit will be run as an independent business.
According to Packingham, Samsung was chosen for two of the three Nexus phones because of its hardware expertise and access to components, and there is no bidding involved in the lead-device program.
