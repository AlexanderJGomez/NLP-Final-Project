The aircraft crashed into a home in Clarence Center, New York, near Buffalo, on Thursday night, killing all 49 people aboard.
Also, a "stick-shaker" device, which noisily vibrates an airplane's controls to warn the pilot of imminent stall, kicked in, he said.
The plane was on autopilot during its approach to the Buffalo airport, Chealander said.
However, severe icing is "not what we saw here," Chealander said, adding that the FAA has no such disengagement rule in effect.
Offering more details, Chealander said Sunday that the plane's nose pitched up 31 degrees, then down 45 degrees.
It came down intact," he said.
