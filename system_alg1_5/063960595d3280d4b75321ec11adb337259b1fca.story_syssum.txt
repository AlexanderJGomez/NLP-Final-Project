This holiday season, I am heading to the only Cuba I've ever known.
So she went into exile in 1961, and she's never been back.
Suddenly she stopped.
There's a hint of Cuba in the taste.
When she plays my favorite Cuban music on the piano, all too rarely, for some reason the notes make me cry.
Maybe it's the hints of her life before me.
But we will be fine.
To Miami, not to Cuba.
But I am tired of the ads for religious charity trips to Cuba and all-inclusive beach resorts where tourists get pampered while my people, once removed, depend on charity for the most basic medical supplies.
I want to put those hints together, fill in the gaps and see for the first time, where I am from.
