(CNN) -- Women undergoing in-vitro fertilization should have only one or two embryos transferred during the process, depending on their age, says a study published Wednesday in the British medical journal The Lancet.
"We show that even in older women, we should never have more than three embryos transferred," says Scott Nelson, one of the study authors who is a professor of reproductive and maternal medicine at the University of Glasgow.
"There are limitations of the study that concern me significantly in terms of the conclusions that were drawn," says Schattman.
"We look at women under the age of 35, 35 to 37, 38 to 39," and so on, says Schattman.
Because IVF is an involved, often draining, process, Schattman says doctors need to determine how many embryos will be transferred on a case by case basis.
