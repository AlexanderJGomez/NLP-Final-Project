In a written statement issued last week, Oz said, "I bring the public information that will help them on their path to be their best selves.
The email sent to Columbia's faculty dean for Health Sciences and Medicine, Dr. Lee Goldman, said the group is "surprised and dismayed" that Oz is on faculty and that he holds a senior administrative position.
Oz is vice chair of the Department of Surgery, at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.
This is not the first time Oz has been called out.
Miller and the other doctors who signed the email echo that sentiment, saying Oz is misleading the public and they tell Columbia's Goldman that having him on the faculty is unacceptable.
"He's a charlatan, and Columbia elevating him to a position of authority is a credence and platform for misleading more people," she said in a phone interview.
He and Fleet share McCaskill's example of Oz's promotion of "miracle weight loss drugs" on the show as failure on Oz's part to follow the oath taken by doctors to do no harm.
For its part, Columbia University is standing by Oz.
