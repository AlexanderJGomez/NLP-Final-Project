Prosecutors are not pressing charges against Pedro and Onil Castro, who were also arrested along with their brother Ariel, with Perez saying there's "no evidence" that they were complicit in the case.
Police say they went to the address once in 2000, before the alleged kidnappings, when Castro reported a fight outside his home, and in 2004, after two of the three women had disappeared.
They said something to her, and Castro "told her to get down.
Their mother, Annita Lugo, did not contact authorities because, she said, she didn't know what to do.
And she ran up to him, and gave him a hug, and they left."
After an "extensive" look at its records, Cleveland police said there were no calls to the Castro house "for women held or women banging on windows."
We cannot do this alone," police said in a statement after the women were freed.
The answer, he said, is no.
