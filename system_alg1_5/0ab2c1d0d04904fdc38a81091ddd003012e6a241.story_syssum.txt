Clearwater, Florida (CNN) -- Jury selection in the Casey Anthony murder trial continued Saturday afternoon following the rejection of nine potential jurors, including one man who posted to his Facebook account that he had a "title, cover and all" ready for a book about the case.
"Yes, sir," the candidate replied.
"No, sir," the man replied.
"Already have the title, cover and all," Assistant State's Attorney Frank George said in reciting one of the posts.
"I've also read that Donald Trump is an alien, and that Elvis is still alive and living in Graceland," the man said.
Coming into Saturday's session, eight people were considered viable candidates for the jury.
"The longer we wait, the more dangers there are," he said.
