Coach Marlon Dorsey acknowledged he "paddled" students, but he defended it as a way to "save these young men from the destruction of self," the court filing said.
"In taking action, the school district considered the seriousness of the circumstances, prevailing policy, input and concerns from parents and the athletes involved, and Coach Dorsey's overall employee performance record.
The three students were beaten for "no legitimate purpose whatsoever," but Dorsey accused them of "failing to run basketball plays correctly," the suit said.
The coach verbally abused basketball players, calling them "sissy," "bitch," "wimp," and "soft," it said.
The suit claims that students and parents told him about the whippings, but he failed to investigate or stop them.
