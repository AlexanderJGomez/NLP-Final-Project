Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- A day after officials announced the cancer diagnosis of Argentina's president, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez wondered Wednesday if the United States could be infecting the region's leaders with the illness.
I'm just putting the thought out there," Chavez said.
Chavez said his ally Fidel Castro had repeatedly warned him to beware of what he eats, as foods are potential vehicles for an illness.
I am just using my freedom to reflect and give commentary on very strange occurrences that are hard to explain," he said.
