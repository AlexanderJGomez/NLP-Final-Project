The Chrysler ad included Dylan asking, "Is there anything more American than America?"
Another tweeted "That Bob Dylan, Chrysler commercial was disappointing and sad on so many levels.
According to Rolling Stone, Dylan previously licensed his track "Motherless Children" to be used in a Jeep ad.
"For Dylan, an artist whose time in the spotlight was most intense in the 1960s, the feat is more difficult, even if he does continue to release albums that gain plaudits and critical acclaim."
