Hilton, 20, is scheduled to appear Thursday in federal court, but he is not expected to plead guilty at that time, said spokesman Thom Mrozek of the U.S. Attorney's Office.
"He also become belligerent toward some of the flight attendants," according to court papers signed by Hilton and his attorney.
Hilton also "punched at, but missed" another flight attendant, the court documents said.
Rick Hilton and his wife of more than 30 years, Kathy, are parents of four children: Paris, Nicky, Barron and Conrad.
A French family was seated behind Hilton, and the father got out of his seat and leaned "over his kids in a protective gesture" during one of Hilton's rants, a flight attendant told authorities, according to court papers.
The flight's pilot, who was second-in-command to the captain, "noticed the smoke detector above the bathroom ceiling had been stuffed with paper towels, apparently to prevent the smoke alarm from sounding," court papers said.
The captain authorized crew members to form a "restraint team" to constrain Hilton before he woke up, authorities said in court papers.
Later, in an interview with the FBI the same day, Hilton said he started his travels in Mykonos, Greece, had a connection in Athens, and then traveled to London, authorities said.
