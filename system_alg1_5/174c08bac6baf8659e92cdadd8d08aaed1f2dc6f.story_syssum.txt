One was Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, the most wanted terrorist in Africa.
Mohammed was killed, but to begin with the Somali security forces had no idea who he was.
Operationally, Mohammed was one of al Qaeda's most effective figures: a bombmaker with aliases, multiple passports and disguises that enabled him to move in and out of Somalia.
Several hundred foreign jihadists -- from Kenya, Sudan, Europe, North America, Iraq and Pakistan -- have made al-Shabaab a more effective group.
"The death of Mohammed and Musa Dheere has effectively removed the top half of the al Qaeda network's explosives expertise in the region," says Kelshall.
Ironically, the Kampala bombings may have indirectly contributed to Mohammed's death.
He escaped, but many civilians were killed.
But al-Shabaab is well-entrenched in central and southern Somalia, where a few dollars are enough to recruit young men with no hope of a job.
And al-Shabaab does not seem to have been knocked off its stride by Mohammed's death.
