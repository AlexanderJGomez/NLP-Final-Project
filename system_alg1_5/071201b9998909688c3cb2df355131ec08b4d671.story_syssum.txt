The agreement is "going to create a lot of good, decent jobs for the people of America," said Lee.
Obama and Lee earlier Thursday said the trade agreement is promising for both economies.
It will promote green jobs and clean energy, another area where we're deepening our cooperation," Obama said.
We will continue to work towards denuclearization in the peninsula," Lee said.
Lee is a reliable ally for Obama, especially when it comes to U.S. policy on North Korea.
In addition to coordinating responses to the shared threat of North Korea, Washington and Seoul are also working together on climate change, economic issues through the G20, and a nuclear summit scheduled for next year in Seoul.
