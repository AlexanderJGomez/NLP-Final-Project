For Stuart, that vow came in the form of opening her own clinic and treating the uninsured.
"Every single person knows somebody without health insurance," says Stuart.
In 2002, these efforts resulted in "The Clinic: Medical Center for the Uninsured," a charitable, sun-filled clinic that has since received more than 40,000 patient visits.
"Since there's no need to spend a lot of time doing paperwork, we have time to talk to the patient and really hear what they're saying," says Stuart.
"Many patients pay as little as a dollar or even 50 cents for the same dignified care that patients contributing in full receive," says Mary Ellen Smith, The Clinic's medical resource coordinator.
"Each day, I get to treat the patients whom our medical system has forgotten, without the hassle of insurance paperwork," says Stuart.
