(CNN) -- The failure of the P5+1 (the United States, United Kingdom, France, China, Russia plus Germany) to reach agreement with Iran Saturday in Geneva is a good thing if it allows the United States and Israel to sort out what really divides them on the Iranian nuclear issue before negotiations resume in coming days.
But short of a final deal in which Iran abandons its nuclear ambitions, it may not be bridgeable.
And here's why.
But it's impossible to ignore, let alone trivialize, Israeli security concerns and vulnerabilities in this regard, particularly in the face of Iran's rhetoric, regional ambitions and support for terrorism over the years.
And none does.
I never argued with him.
However powerful they have become, that legacy endures.
Netanyahu does, repeatedly.
This world view poses enormous challenges for a U.S. administration, partly because it's validated by Iran's own past rhetoric and actions and because Iran has tried to hide suspected military aspects of its nuclear program.
But it's just not feasible.
And neither Iran nor the United States are prepared for that.
Third, the United States is measuring an agreement with Iran at this stage not against an ideal end state -- Iran capitulates and surrenders any hope of maintaining the capacity to enrich uranium, let alone make bombs.
It's evaluating success in terms of what's practical and what will happen if no deal is reached, namely the slide toward the use of military force against Iran.
For Netanyahu, the Palestinians are a long-term challenge; Iran is an imminent, acute problem.
All of this may not be possible.
The United States has no stake in concluding an agreement with Iran that leaves Israel angry, aggrieved and vulnerable.
But for now, buckle your seat belts.
