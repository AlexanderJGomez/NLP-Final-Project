(Rolling Stone)  -- There are moments when "Move Like This," the first new album by the Cars in 24 years, sounds so much like a record by the Cars that you find yourself laughing out loud.
"Move Like This" is a reminder that New Wave can still sound new, especially when the Cars do it.
It opens with a socko one-two punch: "Blue Tip" and "Too Late," textbook Cars songs that place Ocasek's deadpan atop Elliot Easton's tensile lead guitar and Greg Hawkes' blipping, squealing keyboards.
Orr added some warmth, a touch of daylight, to the proceedings, but with him gone, Ocasek has burnished the group's music to a glossier shade of noir.
It pulls you along.
