Um, not many.
That is, policy, not political candidates.
The groups designated as 501(c)(4) became the perfect pots to hold the dough, and they swelled, literally and figuratively.
Alas, yes.
Not exactly political in any way, shape or form.
What's more, the IRS also makes it clear that, in order to qualify, the burden is to prove that "your organization is organized exclusively (italics mine) to promote social welfare."
This has not escaped the notice of Congress, especially Democrats who have been outgunned by Republican-leaning groups.
Fishing expeditions on political-sounding names is just stupid, if not venal.
