(CNN) -- Even by the standards of supercars, and nearly a decade after it was first introduced, the Porsche Carrera GT is something remarkable.
Yet as soon as the Carrera GT is moving, it starts to feel far more normal.
That mighty engine is happy to trundle along at low revs and, once you've got used to the clutch, the gearshift is light and accurate.
So high that, to get consistently close to them, you'd need both a racetrack and time to learn the car's habits properly.
Astonishing though its straight-line pace is, it's in the corners that the GT really comes alive.
For some, that's part of the GT's appeal as a supercar, of course -- but you've got to be extremely confident in your own abilities to consider switching the system off.
The higher the limits are, the bigger the risks when you overstep them, so if you do lose control, you're likely to be traveling at mind-blowing speeds.
