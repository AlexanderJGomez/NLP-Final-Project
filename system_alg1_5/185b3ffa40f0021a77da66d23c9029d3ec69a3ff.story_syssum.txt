Singer Phil Everly -- one half of the groundbreaking, smooth-sounding, record-setting duo, the Everly Brothers -- has died, a hospital spokeswoman said.
They became international sensations over the next five years with tunes such as "Bye Bye Love," "Wake Up Little Susie," "When Will I Be Loved" and "All I Have to Do Is Dream."
"Thanks, Phil...and 'Bye Bye.'"
In 1957, they found a Felice and Boudleaux Bryant song, "Bye Bye Love."
More success followed -- including "Cathy's Clown," which the duo wrote -- and they stayed particularly popular in Britain.
Their remaining years were highlights by occasional shows, hall of fame inductions and various other honors, including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997.
