We need each other.
Where England is small and crowded, Scotland is huge and empty.
That righteous Scottish temper showing through again.

In fact, the opposite is true.
Likewise, in a frighteningly insecure world, we all benefit from a united defense.
The ties that bind us, then, are historical and poetic.
Many, many British soldiers have done so in the past.
It's nonsense, of course, but a reminder -- again -- of how much mystery and wonder the Scottish countryside brings to the UK.
If I'm honest, the prospect of a Union dominated too heavily by the English worries me.
We're simply not as loquacious or romantic as our Scottish cousins.
