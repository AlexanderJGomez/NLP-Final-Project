Nine gunmen were killed in the strike, the U.S. military said.
"It just takes your breath away, their capacity and their bravery and their incredible timing," Vice President Joe Biden said Wednesday morning, referring to the unit's capabilities.
Beyond tactical expertise, the SEALs -- short for Sea, Air and Land teams -- needed to have extraordinary physical strength.
Among other missions, the SEALs were deployed to act as advisers and train South Vietnamese commandos.
The first military flag officer to set foot in Afghanistan after September 11, 2001, was a SEAL in charge of all special operations for Central Command, according to the SEALs history page on its web site.
Several high-value terrorist targets were captured by the SEALs, including Ahmed Hashim Abed, the alleged mastermind of the murder and mutilation of four Blackwater guards in Fallujah in 2004.
SEAL training is "the ultimate test for a guy," said Chris Heben, a former SEAL with 10 years of experience carrying out missions in Africa, the Middle East and Afghanistan.
SEALs train between 18 and 24 months, with the pinnacle of training coming during Hell Week, five days in which trainees are constantly cold, hungry, sleep deprived and wet.
"Every day is like climbing Mount Everest," Heben said.
He had gone to college, and though he was very bright he was spending more time working out than on his classwork.
"I enlisted in the Navy immediately," Heben said.
Though he won't discuss specific areas of countries where he's carried out missions, he said that he normally trained for missions on exact mock-ups of a targeted location.
