In the eight years of George W. Bush's presidency, unmanned aircraft -- or drones -- attacked militant targets 45 times.
"The United States is committed to following international legal standards," said Rep. John Tierney, D-Massachusetts, the subcommittee's chairman.
"Only a combatant -- a lawful combatant -- may carry out the use of killing with combat drones," said Mary Ellen O'Connell, a professor from the University of Notre Dame law school.
The U.S. government, she said, should use force only "when we can accomplish more good than harm, and that is not the case with the use of drones in places like Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia."
CIA personnel, he said, could be guilty of war crimes.
But the statute, he said, was "designed as dynamic authority to be shaped by practice and by necessity."
Peter Bergen, a fellow at the New America Foundation, a nonpartisan group, suggested that the increase in drone attacks during the Obama administration is, in part, revenge for the bombing of a CIA base in eastern Afghanistan that killed seven Americans on December 30, 2009.
Such attacks, which have taken a civilian toll in many cases, have frequently caused tension between Pakistan and the United States.
