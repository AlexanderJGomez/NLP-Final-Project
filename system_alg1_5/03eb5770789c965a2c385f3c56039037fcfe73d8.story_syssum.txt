Tamir, 12, was fatally shot in November by a Cleveland police officer, while police shot and killed John Crawford III, 22, in a Walmart in Beavercreek, Ohio, in August.
"The Cleveland Police protect and serve Browns stadium," he said.
Within two seconds of exiting the car, Officer Timothy Loehmann shot Tamir, and the boy died the next day, police said.
The Cleveland Browns' vice president of communications, Peter John-Baptiste, said the NFL team has "great respect" for the work of the Cleveland police.
In September, a grand jury decided not to indict police officers in Crawford's shooting death.
He was shot twice, once in the elbow and once in the torso, the prosecutor said, and died shortly after being transported to a nearby hospital.
