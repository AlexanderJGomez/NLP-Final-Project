London, England (CNN) -- London's two major airports were closed Monday as a cloud of ash from a volcano in Iceland moved east into England, British air authorities said.
In addition, Dublin's airport closed overnight, the Irish Aviation Authority said Sunday, and will remain closed until at least 9 a.m. (4 a.m.) Monday.
Flights were also stopped at all airports in Northern Ireland, as well as the British airports at Ronaldsway, Prestwick, Carlisle, Doncaster, Humberside, Leeds Bradford and East Midlands.
"The government is carefully monitoring this situation and the safety of passengers will remain our paramount concern," said Philip Hammond, transport secretary.
"It could go on another year," he said, noting that an eruption lasted that long in 1820.
Previously, only 18-hour forecasts had been available.
