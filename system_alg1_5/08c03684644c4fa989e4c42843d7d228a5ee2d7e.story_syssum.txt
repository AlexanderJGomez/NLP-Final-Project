On Tuesday, it was also about Jonylah.
"It's just very, very sad," said Victor Brunner, a friend of the family.
Jeneen Thomas, an activist who did not know Jonylah's family but felt compelled to come out Tuesday, says she hoped the pointless killing of a baby girl, as she sat on her father's lap, wakes people up.
The torrid pace continued into 2013, with 43 homicides in January, and after a drop in February, they've picked up once again.
Her father, Jonathan Watkins -- believed to be the target of the shooting, according to police -- was also hit.
Brooks, the church's pastor, said he hopes Tuesday's outpouring of support -- and the positive steps he hopes Chicagoans will take in their own lives, and those of their neighbors, to prevent such violence -- will show the world their suffering and their dedication to stand behind one another.
