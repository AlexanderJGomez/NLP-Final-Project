"I think that the first part of his speech was excellent, and he laid out the reasons why it was important to intervene and what would have happened in Benghazi.
I think there's a chance, if we keep the pressure on, Gadhafi could be thrown under the bus (by people surrounding him.)"
... (But) if we tell Gadhafi, 'Don't worry, you're not going to be removed by force,' I think that's very encouraging for Gadhafi."
In order to not be humiliated, we couldn't back down."
"I thought he did a good job talking about the signal we would send, that we are a values-based people, and stranding by these young people in Libya will serve us well in the future.
"I think it is a great speech.
The Libyan people ... deserve a better government."
"The president's speech is illogical.
Because Gadhafi was slaughtering his people.
P.J.
The issue is the mechanism.
Again, consultation with Congress in the days ahead is going to be very important.
But he explained the objective, and he explained what he wants to do, and the airstrikes have succeeded.
I applaud the president tonight."
But ... he finally did it.
At the same time, he made very clear that in his U.S. policy -- and the policy of many of our allies -- that Libya needs to have a new government that responds to the demands of the Libyan people, and that we will pursue every diplomatic and economic means to that end.
And furthermore, I think he made a compelling case that these early U.S. actions really have accomplished what the United States promised to do, and that was to stop Gadhafi from killing other people.
Nobody knows.
It thought that was left cloudy, and is going to continue the debate.
This is really something that should have been done four weeks ago, when it was really likely that the rebels, by virtue of ... a multilateral action, could have tipped the scales and made Gadhafi think ... he needs to get out of there.
