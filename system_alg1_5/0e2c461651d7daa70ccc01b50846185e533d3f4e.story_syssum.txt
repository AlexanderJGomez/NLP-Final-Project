This study, recently published in the journal Pediatrics, has garnered tremendous media attention.
First, I am surprised that, before this study, most people assumed that children wouldn't engage in a behavior that is so common in teenagers and young adults.
While people report engaging in non-suicidal self-injury for various reasons, almost always, they hurt themselves in response to stressful situations or negative emotions.
After all, children are subject to extremely powerful emotions and have a tremendous capacity for fear and worry.
The final thing about non-suicidal self-injury that surprises me is that it occurs at all.
This suggests to me that self-injury might be related in some ways to a process, or processes, that have evolved over time.
You'd think that people who recurrently injured themselves would be at increased risk of committing suicide, but this is far from clear.
People who engage in non-suicidal self-injury typically are struggling with other psychiatric conditions, such as a mood or personality disorder, so they are at increased risk of suicide generally.
But, suicide attempts are only one kind of violence against the self.
Then we'd be able to officially believe them.
