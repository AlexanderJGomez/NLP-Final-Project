Jackson Irungu is quitting Kenya after being targeted for being gay.
The law books help create the ambivalence.
"They have a weapon to which they defend themselves," says Pauline Kimani, a leader of an umbrella organization for gays in Kenya.
But many say that gays shouldn't have rights, are "un-African," and not good Christians.
"Amongst traditional Kenyan people, it was unheard of," says Pastor Kuchio.
As a result, most homosexuals in the country have to hide their sexual preference for fear of social stigma, say gay activists in Kenya.
But for an openly gay man Kenyan like Irungu, progress is too slow in Kenya.
