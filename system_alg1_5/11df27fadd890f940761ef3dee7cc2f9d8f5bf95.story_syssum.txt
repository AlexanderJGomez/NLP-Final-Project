U.S. natural gas, globally, is abundant and cheap, making it an attractive commodity for other nations that are net importers of energy resources.
In 1951, we had 1,200 ships in the U.S. foreign trade.
Today, we have 90 ships.
Our shipyards assure me that if we were to adopt such a policy, they could retool their production lines and have liquefied natural gas tankers sliding down the ways within five years, not long after the first export terminal is completed.
We must seize the exportation of natural gas as an opportunity to reinvigorate the domestic maritime industry and bolster our national defense.
We are a maritime nation, and we can build liquefied natural gas tankers in America.
