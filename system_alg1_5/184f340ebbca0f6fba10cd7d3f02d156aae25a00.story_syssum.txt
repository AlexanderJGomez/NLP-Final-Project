If Team USA was going to win at the Special Olympics World Winter Games, Nelson thought, they had some conditioning to do.
His oldest son, Ryan, 29, has Asperger's syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism.
"He put the challenge out there and I accepted it," said Teddy Leonard, captain of Team USA.
"It was very hard at first," goalie Lisa Salim said.
"The whole team suffered because one person stepped out of line," Leonard said.
Their efforts paid off.
"I'm so proud of them, and I'm proud of myself," Leonard said.
"I'm able to be on a run all the time," Salim said.
"We have a saying in our team that we're champions, but we're champions in everything we do," Nelson said.
"This is forever," he said.
No matter what happens, I'm not going to quit."
