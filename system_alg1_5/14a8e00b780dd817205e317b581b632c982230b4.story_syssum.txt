(CNN) -- I'll never forget watching Lady Diana Spencer tie the knot with Charles, the Prince of Wales, on July 29, 1981.
After all, William and Kate have dated for eight years, whereas Charles was linked to a series of blue-blooded types and then, suddenly, was marrying an adorable kindergarten teacher who had also worked as a nanny.
While we watched Diana ride in a beautiful traditional carriage to St. Paul's, we munched on scones and clotted cream, and drank endless cups of tea.
The unusual design of Diana's dress, with its ruffled v-neck neckline, stunned us.
When I watched Diana wed Charles, I never imagined that I would get to meet her twice, in the coming years.
At the time, I was editor-in-chief of Flare, Canada's fashion magazine.
She was also charismatic and even more stunning up close, in person, than in pictures.
With a mother like that, it's no wonder William wanted to marry Kate, a woman he knows through and through, and with whom he has an obviously warm and loving relationship.
Having met Diana, I have no doubt she would have made Kate, her soon-to-be daughter-in-law, feel like her BFF from the moment William brought her home.
