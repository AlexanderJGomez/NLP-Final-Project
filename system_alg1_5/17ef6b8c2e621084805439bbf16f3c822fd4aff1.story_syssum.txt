Not long ago, Kobani's fall to ISIS seemed certain.
Even though local defenders control some 70% of the city, Kobani is cut off, and ISIS forces have been shelling it with mortars from the east and south, local government official Anwar Muslim said this week.
One of the 28 bundles dropped in and around Kobani on Monday drifted away from its target zone, a U.S. official said.
Fighting in Kobani continued Wednesday, with six Kurdish defenders killed and the bodies of 10 ISIS fighters recovered, a Kurdish fighter there said.
He said there are casualties on both sides, but the numbers were not immediately known.
