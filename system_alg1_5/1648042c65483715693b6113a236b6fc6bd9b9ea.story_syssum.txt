Samuel Tombs, an economist at Capital Economics, said there was an obvious boost to UK economic growth during the Games but it was too early to see a legacy benefit.
Although the cultural heritage of the Olympics is important, it could take years before we see its true economic value, according to Tombs.
55% of the companies that won contracts, directly related to the Olympics, saw growth within the turnover of their business, which is positive."
said the Games were "a triumph of public endeavour... it's a very good example of what a very dynamic and focused public sector can do."
