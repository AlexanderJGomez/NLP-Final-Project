Now, one year into my 40s, I'm blessed with home ownership and the realization that I am officially a "grown-up."
For some of my family and friends, it was the first time they were seeing my newly purchased home.
My answers varied from "how about a guest room" to "possibly a home gym" to "I really don't know."
I started stammering and was slightly embarrassed, especially when he was in my presence for some of these questions.
After all, if I were in my 20s or 30s and dating, the house likely would have been viewed by most as a great investment.
So, needless to say, my friends and family saw my house as a symbol of my last-ditch effort to claim a white picket fenced yard filled with kids.
So, I might have another barbecue for the Fourth of July.
