This specialized government agency is mandated to provide strategic policy advice to the chairman of Abu Dhabi's Executive Council, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, The Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi.
CNN's John Defterios met Mubarak in Abu Dhabi and began by asking him about Mubadala's recent purchase of a 7.5 percent stake in the U.S. investment firm, Carlyle Group for $1.35 billion.
Mubarak: If you look at the areas Carlyle has focused on - aerospace, energy, power, infrastructure, transportation, healthcare - these are all areas you find Mubadala very aggressively acting in.
Mubarak: We've met with all the executives at Carlyle, we've looked at their track record.
Defterios: That's an understatement.
Mubarak: It's been a tremendous roller coaster ride over the last couple of years, and the growth in Abu Dhabi, the growth in the region and the growth that Mubadala has gone through is tremendous.
Again, right off the bat, it's a financial investment, it makes a lot of sense, it provides the right returns for us.
But beyond that, we created a strategic alliance with Ferrari.
Well here we are, it's 2007, gas is flowing from Qatar to the UAE and it's done.
Mubarak: Abu Dhabi has typically been very conservative in its approach.
We've always taken a lot of care towards planning, towards strategic thinking, in any sector we are involved in.
