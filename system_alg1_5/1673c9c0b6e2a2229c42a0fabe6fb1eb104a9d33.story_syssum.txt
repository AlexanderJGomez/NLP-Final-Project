Professor Elwood, whose previous work showed that prawns endure pain, said his research highlighted the need to investigate the treatment of crustaceans used in food industries.
Hermit crabs have no shell of their own so inhabit other structures, usually empty mollusc shells.
"There has been a long debate about whether crustaceans including crabs, prawns and lobsters feel pain," said Professor Elwood in a press statement.
"Such trade-offs are seen in vertebrates in which the response to pain is controlled with respect to other requirements.
"More research is needed in this area where a potentially very large problem is being ignored," said Elwood.
"There is no protection for these animals (with the possible exception of certain states in Australia) as the presumption is that they cannot experience pain.
