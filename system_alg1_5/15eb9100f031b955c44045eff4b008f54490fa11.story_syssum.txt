"I told her it's on hold," said Pesek.
"It's on pilings," Larry Pesek said.
"Our soil is sandy, so it handles water well, but not this much rain."
"When you get a lot of rain, it tends to spread out," said Chanton, a geochemist.
More than 26 inches of rain had been recorded in Sanborn, south of Tallahassee, by Tuesday morning.
"We have significant flooding problems," said Harvey Campbell, a spokesman for Columbia County's emergency operations center.
Another area river, the Anclote, was above flood stage on Tuesday, and water is not expected to recede for two days.
CNN iReporter Alex Butler, who is also a reporter at CNN affiliate WFTX, said normally there is a wall separating the land from the river, but the wall was underwater Tuesday.
