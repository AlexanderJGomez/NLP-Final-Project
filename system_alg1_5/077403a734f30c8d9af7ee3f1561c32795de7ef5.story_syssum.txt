"We're going to require as a condition for raising the debt ceiling something really important about the debt," Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, told reporters.
"From my point of view, taxes are not on the table because we don't have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem," McConnell said.
"It is clear once again that the two parties' priorities are significantly different," Reid said of Ryan's proposal, adding it would provide no help for the middle class.
In addition, Reid rejected the contention that reforming Social Security must be part of deficit reduction strategy, saying: "That has nothing to do with the deficit.
"If we don't begin to do that, and at some point think about raising taxes, the whole American economy will come close to collapse."
