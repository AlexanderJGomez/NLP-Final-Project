"November 3, 2006, is when they stole my daughter," she told CNN Thursday.
When I entered my house, my daughter stayed on the patio, and that was when she was taken."
It all happened in about two minutes, Rodriguez said.
In Guatemala, she is known as Anyeli.
"Our view remains that, at the time, this appeared to be a legitimate adoption.
That's more than enough proof, Rodriguez says, that her daughter should come home.
Also, questions have been raised about whether the person presenting the child at the embassy was, in fact, Rodriguez's sister, which casts doubt on the kidnapping story, the source said.
The adoptive parents were unavailable for comment, referring CNN to their lawyer in Washington, who declined to comment.
