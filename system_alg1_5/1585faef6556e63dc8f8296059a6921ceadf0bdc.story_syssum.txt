Osh, Kyrgyzstan (CNN) -- The flow of refugees fleeing southern Kyrgyzstan has gone from a flood to a trickle, the Uzbekistan Foreign Ministry said.
But gunfire was heard Thursday from the center of Osh, Kyrgyzstan, a sign that the violent ethnic clashes may be intensifying again.
Several countries, including the United States, Germany and Russia, have also sent aid.
Francois Blancy, deputy head of the Red Cross regional office in Uzbekistan, said more aid is needed.
