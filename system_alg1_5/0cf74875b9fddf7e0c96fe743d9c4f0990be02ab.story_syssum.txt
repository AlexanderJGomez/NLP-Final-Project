ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Police Wednesday arrested the suspected head of an Italian mafia murder squad following a two-day manhunt after he eluded police by crawling through sewer pipes, according to Italian media reports.
Setola is believed to have slipped into a tunnel built under his hideout near Naples on Monday, as police closed in on him, according to the reports.
Anti-mafia police have been searching for Setola for months, and had already arrested his wife and two suspected members of his crew, according to the reports.
Corriere published a photo of Setola wearing sunglasses with his left eye bandaged.
In November, police arrested an Italian police officer suspected of informing Setola about police operations.
