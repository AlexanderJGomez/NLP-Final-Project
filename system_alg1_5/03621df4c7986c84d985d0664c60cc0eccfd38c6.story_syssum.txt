The inability of the Russian authorities to prevent attacks was on display in Volgograd, a key connecting point for those en route to Sochi.
In 2007, when Putin persuaded the Olympic Committee to choose Sochi, there were already powerful reasons to refuse.
At the same time, the Islamist insurrection was growing in the North Caucasus, directly adjacent to the proposed Olympic sites.
Reality, however, was beginning to close in.
In 2009, the Islamists turned to terror attacks in Russia proper.
In addition to the danger from terrorists, however, there is also a danger from the Russian forces.
Instead, it set off a conflict that has been claiming victims for 19 years.
