The justices, by a 6-3 vote, concluded Petrella's daughter did not wait too long to make her claims against Metro-Goldwyn Mayer, which made and distributed the Academy Award-winning drama.
Earlier courts had limited similar lawsuits, often filed many years after movies, plays, and television shows first premiered, by the estates of actors, writers, and producers.
Federal copyright law gave Paula Petrella the sole right to renew the copyrights before the term expired, which she did in 1991.
Paula Petrella claims she is the sole owner of the book and the original screenplay, and that the subsequent film infringes on those copyrights.
"If the rule were, as MGM urges, 'sue soon, or forever hold your peace,' copyright owners would have to mount a federal case fast to stop seemingly innocuous infringements, lest those infringements eventually grow in magnitude," she said.
She will miss out on damages for periods prior to the three-year look-back, but her right to prospective injunctive relief should, in most cases, remain unaltered."
"Raging Bull" won two Oscars, including best actor for De Niro, who portrayed the boxer.
The case is Petrella v. MGM, Inc. (12-1315).
