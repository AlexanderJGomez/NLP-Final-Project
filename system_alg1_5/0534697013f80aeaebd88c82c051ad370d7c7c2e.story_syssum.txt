Also Wednesday, France recalled its ambassador to Syria, the French Foreign Ministry said.
"Until now, most of the protests have been peaceful."
Free Syrian Army Lt. Abdullah al Odah, speaking to CNN in Istanbul, Turkey, called the late-night operation brief.
They include Qaboun and Arbeen, Damascus neighborhoods, and Saqba, a suburb.
They've also had active operations in and around Homs, Idlib and other areas recently, he said.
The group's leaders, who had been exiled to Turkey, say they're directing a guerrilla war effort against the al-Assad regime, which acknowledges an increasing number of deadly attacks on its soldiers, including a bombing of a Syrian army tank near Daraa recently.
The Arab League, meeting in Rabat, Morocco, said al-Assad didn't stick by his pledge to release detainees, withdraw armed elements from populated areas, and allow unfettered access to the nation by journalists and Arab League monitors.
The Syrian Arab News Agency, a state-run outlet, quoted a government source as saying that "Syria decided not to participate" in Rabat, where there was a ministerial meeting of the Arab League council and an Arab-Turkish cooperation meeting.
All of the credit and the helping hands that have been extended to the Syrian regime to date have been wasted," he added.
Mohammed al-Ikhsafi, Morocco's ambassador to Syria, told CNN a demonstration occurred in front of his country's embassy in Damascus on Wednesday.
The demonstration is over now.
On Saturday, pro-government protesters attacked Arab and Turkish entities in Damascus, Aleppo and Latakia.
But opposition groups said the gesture was too little, too late.
The number of civilians killed Wednesday was 20 -- 11 in Homs, 7 in Idlib, and 1 in each Daraa and Damascus suburbs -- said the Local Coordination Committee of Syria, a coalition of activists.
