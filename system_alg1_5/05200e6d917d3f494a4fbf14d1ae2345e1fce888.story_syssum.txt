One survivor, identified as Robert Decker, was found and taken to a hospital, but efforts to find more survivors had proven fruitless, said Maj. Denis McGuire of the Rescue Coordination Center in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
"All we've got is the debris field," McGuire said.
About 25 minutes later, a helicopter arrived and discovered the survivor, the body, the overturned helicopter and two empty life rafts, he said.
At that time, based on water temperature and the size of the search area, officials will decide whether to continue the effort, he said.
The survivor was taken to the Health Sciences Center in St. John's, Newfoundland.
