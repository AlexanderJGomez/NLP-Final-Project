Perry's views, however, bear further exploration.
Studies of identical twins, who share the same genes, have shown that, if one twin is gay, the other is more likely to be gay, suggesting sexual orientation is influenced by genetics.
Although the study did not find a particular gene, it suggested that such a gene exists on the X chromosome.
While it is possible to patent certain genetic material, the gene must be "useful" to qualify for patent protection.
Most patents on genes relate to diseases, such as breast cancer, diabetes, or, as Perry noted, alcoholism.
Gays and lesbians are not sick, and the medical community agrees.
And, contrary to Perry's insinuation, sexual orientation is not like a disease.
And our rights shouldn't depend on it.
