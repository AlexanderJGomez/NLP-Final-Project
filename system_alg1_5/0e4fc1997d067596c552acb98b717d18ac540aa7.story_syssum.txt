"This magnitude 8.2 is not the large earthquake that we were expecting in this area," said Mark Simons, a geophysicist at Caltech in Pasadena, California.
"We do not know when it's going to occur," he said.
Since 1973, Chile has had more than a dozen quakes of magnitude-7.0 and above.
But the area to the north and south of Tuesday's quake "did not rupture in this event," Simons said.
"It may not occur for many, many years."
