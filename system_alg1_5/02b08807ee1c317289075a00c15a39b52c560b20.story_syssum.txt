The Pentagon's most expensive weapons program ever, the F-35 warplane, is cleared for takeoff again.
The 2014 Farnborough International Airshow began Monday, and runs through July 20 in Farnborough, England.
The F-35's lead contractor, Lockheed Martin, which is producing variants of the plane for the U.S. Navy, Marines and Air Force,  also worked with investigators following the fleet's grounding.
While all models have been grounded in the past for various problems, the version for the Marines, the F-35B, has had more issues.
"It's a tremendously complex project," he said, adding that cost issues remain a concern.
