It's potentially a risky surgery, but everything's ready: The doctors and nurses are in the operating room, the surgical instruments are sterilized and ready to go, and the chief resident is furiously Twittering on his laptop.
"Here's something different: HenryFordNews is live tweeting surgery today, getting some buzz, too," wrote one Twitter participant from Massachusetts.
"We're trying to use this as a way to get the word out," Rogers said.
Four months ago, Park's colleague, Robert Hendrick, tweeted his own varicose vein removal surgery here as it was happening (he was, obviously, under local anesthesia).
"I wanted a record for other people who might be interested in the same surgery," added Hendrick, who also posted photos and video of his surgery.
"Gosh, this is big," he said to his colleagues in the operating room.
After conferring with Laungani and others in the operating room, Rogers decided he could remove just part of the kidney.
"The robotic partial nephrectomy was a success," he wrote.
"Thank you for joining us today."
