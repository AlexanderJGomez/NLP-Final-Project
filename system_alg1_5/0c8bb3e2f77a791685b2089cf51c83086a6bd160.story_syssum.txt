In January, the United Nations Human Rights Council said Israeli settlements amount to "creeping annexation" of Palestinian territories by Israel and have taken a "heavy toll" on the rights and sovereignty of Palestinians.
On Wednesday, Meir Margalit, a Jerusalem City Council member from the left-wing Meretz party, criticized Wednesday's settlement approval and described it as "provocation" by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government.
Israel's construction of settlements "is more important than peace in the Middle East," Margalit charged.
Brachie Sprung, an advisor to the Jerusalem mayor, said construction permission was granted by local planning and building committee.
Hagit Ofran, settlement watch director for the Israeli activist group Peace Now, said the construction plan was initially filed in April 2012, and the length of time behind its approval is typical.
