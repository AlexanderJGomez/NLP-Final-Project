No medication was found, and she later sued.
"I'm pretty excited that they agreed with me, they see that it was wrong for the school to do that," Redding said from her Hobbs, New Mexico, home after the ruling was announced.
Redding was an eighth-grade honor student in 2003, with no history of disciplinary problems at Safford Middle School, about 127 miles from Tucson, Arizona.
A strip search was conducted by Wilson's assistant and a school nurse, both females.
"The strip search was the most humiliating experience I have ever had," Redding said in an affidavit.
"Wilson's treatment of Redding was abusive, and it was not reasonable for him to believe that the law permitted it," said Ginsburg, who was especially forceful during oral arguments in April, criticizing the school's actions.
"Preservation of order, discipline and safety in public schools is simply not the domain of the Constitution," he said.
"When parents send their kids to school, they can now breathe a sigh of relief they will not end up naked before school officials," Wolf said .
Redding, now 19, said she has never gotten over her experience.
The case is Safford Unified School District No.
