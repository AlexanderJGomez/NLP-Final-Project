House mice not native to the island are threatening the Tristan albatross with extinction, the RSPB said.
The mice on the island eat the chicks of the albatross and bunting before they make it to the fledgling stage, the RSPB said.
Because of the impact from house mice, introduced to the island by sealers in the 18th and 19th centuries, conservation alliance BirdLife International earlier this year listed both the Tristan albatross and the Gough bunting as critically endangered -- the highest threat level before extinction.
"We've known for a long time that the mice were killing albatross chicks in huge numbers," said RSPB scientist Richard Cuthbert, who recently visited the island to assess the problem.
"The decline in bunting numbers is alarming," said Peter Ryan of the University of Cape Town, who has been studying buntings on the island since the 1980s.
One species -- the wandering albatross -- has a wingspan of 11 feet, the RSPB says.
The birds can fly thousands of miles without a pause, and their only need to touch land is to nest and raise their young, the RSPB says.
