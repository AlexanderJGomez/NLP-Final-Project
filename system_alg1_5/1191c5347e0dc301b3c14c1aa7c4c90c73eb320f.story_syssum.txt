Dulles, Virginia (CNN)Two quick-thinking passengers in the third row of a United flight to Denver tackled and subdued a man who was heading toward the cockpit, other travelers on the plane told CNN on Tuesday.
A flight attendant used plastic ties to bind the man's wrists as the plane headed back, she said.
Like he said 'jihad' a couple times (while he was being restrained)," Lindstrom said.
The man was rattling on about someone trying to bring the plane down, then become despondent and cry, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
At another, the man seems to cry as he says, "I'm so sorry."
There is nothing, so far, in the tackled man's background to suggest he has a connection to terrorists, the government source said.
Some opted to take the first flight to Colorado on Tuesday, while others chose to leave later, according to Punzenberger, the United spokesman.
