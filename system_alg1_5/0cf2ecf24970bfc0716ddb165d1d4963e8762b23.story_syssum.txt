Until recently, Berlusconi appeared to be leading a charmed life.
In Parliament, opponents tabled 51 confidence votes in him in the past three years alone, but Italians have thrice elected him as prime minister.
Businessman Gianvencenzo Coppi traveled to Rome to hear center-left rival, Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani, talk about his commitment to the private sector, but he told CNN he hadn't made up his mind whom he would vote for, but it was unlikely to be Berlusconi.
"He's making promises in my opinion he cannot maintain," said Coppi.
Berlusconi turned his attention to politics in 1993 when he formed the center-right Forza Italia Party and the following year, in a snap election, he won the post of prime minister.
At that time, the tycoon had presided over the longest-serving post-war Italian government.
But the following month, Berlusconi's second wife, Veronica Lario, filed for divorce -- alleging Berlusconi had an inappropriate relationship with an 18-year-old aspiring model whose birthday party he had attended.
With the country's economy reeling amid the financial crisis, pressure on Berlusconi grew.
El Mahroug has said she never had sex with Berlusconi and that she lied to him about her age, telling him she was 24.
There are still people who use the penal code as a weapon in their ideological battles," he said earlier this year.
When confronted with these remarks, Berlusconi laughed off this and other gaffes.
