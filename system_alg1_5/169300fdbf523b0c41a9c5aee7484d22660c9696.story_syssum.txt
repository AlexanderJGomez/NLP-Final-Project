New Delhi, India (CNN) -- India and Pakistan traded bitter accusations Wednesday after New Delhi said Pakistani troops had killed two of its soldiers in the disputed territory of Kashmir, a flash point between the two nations since their creation.
Pakistan said it is committed to "a constructive, sustained and result-oriented process of engagement with India," and is working to ensure their relations are normal.
Pakistani army troops repulsed the attack, but one Pakistani soldier was killed and another critically injured, Pakistan said.
The disputed territory lies in India's Kashmir Valley, separated from Pakistan by the 450-mile Line of Control.
Bilateral talks were suspended in 2008 after an attack by Pakistani militants in Mumbai, India's most populous city, killed more than 160 people.
The conflict over Kashmir dates back to 1947, after Britain relinquished control of the Indian subcontinent, giving birth to modern India and Pakistan.
CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh reported from New Delhi, and journalist Habib Nasir reported from Islamabad, Pakistan.
