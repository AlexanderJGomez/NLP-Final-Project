Manchester United had started strongly at Stamford Bridge and the opening strike from Eto'o, which took a heavy deflection, came against the run of play.
For United, who are seventh in the table and 14 points off Arsenal's lead, and Moyes, victory over their chief rivals would be tonic enough for now.
In Sunday's other match, Tottenham moved level on points with fourth-placed Liverpool with a 3-1 away win at Swansea.
Tottenham are unbeaten in the EPL since Tim Sherwood replaced Andre Villas-Boas at the helm while Swansea, under the leadership of Michael Laudrup, have now gone eight league games without a win and hover near the drop zone.
Barcelona, who welcomed star man Lionel Messi back for his first league start of 2014, poured forward but the home side dug in and delivered a defensive display which earned them a share of the points, a result which the Levante home fans joyously celebrated like a victory.
"It's an important win but we need to back it up," Ranieri said.
"We dedicate this win to the new coach," said Balotelli.
