Arkansas' Supreme Court on Friday afternoon stopped any more same-sex marriages in the state, a court spokeswoman said, leaving the legal status of more than 400 gay and lesbian couples who got marriage licenses in limbo.
Pulaski County, at least, was issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples by Thursday afternoon.
In those cases, U.S. district judges ruled that the marriage restrictions violate the federal Constitution's equal protection guarantee.
Carl Tobias, a constitutional law professor at the University of Richmond, said Friday that he expects more challenges in state courts to same-sex marriage prohibitions.
