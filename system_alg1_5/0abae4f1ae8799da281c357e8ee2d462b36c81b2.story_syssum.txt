The funeral procession was for a protester killed Sunday, the observatory said.
Ghiyath Mattar, described as a key organizer of protests against al-Assad's regime, was killed after being arrested last Tuesday in the Damascus suburb of Darya, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said in a statement released Sunday.
"His personality was perfectly built to take the role of a leader," said another man, a colleague of Mattar's.
The operation led to the arrests, the friend said.
Mattar, 26, was on the run for three months before being taken into custody, according to the Syrian Observatory.
Navi Pillay, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, put the number killed in the unrest at 2,600, citing "reliable sources on the ground," in remarks prepared for delivery Tuesday during the commission's session.
Mattar's colleague said that Syrian security forces fired on mourners, and that one man was shot and later died.
