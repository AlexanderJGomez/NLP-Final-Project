Howard Jackson, a prosecutor with the Brooklyn District Attorney's office, told reporters Saturday that Daquan Breland faces a criminal possession of a weapon charge in addition to second-degree murder.
Wright, a 19-year-old from Brooklyn, was charged Saturday with criminal possession of a weapon.
Both men have some kind of relationship with the young boy's father, 21-year-old Anthony Hennis, who as of Friday had declined to be interviewed, according to Kelly.
"I haven't prosecuted a case like this before," said Jackson, who handles homicide cases for his office.
