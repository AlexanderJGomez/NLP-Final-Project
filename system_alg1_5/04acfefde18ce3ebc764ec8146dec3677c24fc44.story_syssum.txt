The petition, which asks the village of Moreauville to reverse a "vicious dog" ban against pit bulls and rottweilers, has drawn nearly 40,000 signatures.
"If anything ever happened to him, I would just shut down," O'Hara told KALB.
Moreauville is not the first to pass a ordinance restricting the ownership of pit bulls, rottweilers or other so-called "vicious dogs."
Besides, pit bulls are not a breed of dog.
For this reason it is important to evaluate and treat each dog, no matter its breed, as an individual."
