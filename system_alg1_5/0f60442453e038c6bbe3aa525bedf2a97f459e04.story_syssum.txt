Since 1995, states have been free to set their own maximum speed limits, leading to long debates on safety standards.
The top rural speed limit is normally 70 mph, but in 2006 it set a maximum daytime speed of 80 miles per hour, the highest speed limit on the country, on more than 500 miles of rural interstate in its southwest corner.
When it comes to accident rates, though, you would be far better off on a Montana interstate than competing with the island's frenetic drivers on the way to Paradise Point.
As you continue west, interstate speed limits bump up to 70 in Iowa, and then you can maintain a steady 75 from Nebraska through to the California line, where interstate speeds drop off to 70 again.
The maximum legal speed is roughly 80 mph in Poland, Austria, France and a few other countries.
The results were clear: "By and large, across the 50 states, there was no discernible effect from the higher limits," Yowell said.
While Yowell admits most states are well-intentioned, he's "not willing to accept that speed limits are solely a function of safety," he said.
In part, Yowell looks to differences in political cultures to explain the great continental divide in speed limits.
With the speed limit set at that level, traffic tends to move smoothly, reducing the risk of accidents, Baxter said.
If you put the limit below that speed, some vehicles are traveling far more slowly than the fastest drivers, creating the most dangerous conditions of all.
As Joe Aubain, executive director of the St. Thomas-St. John Chamber of Commerce, puts it, "Even if you wanted to go a whole lot faster, you couldn't," he said.
