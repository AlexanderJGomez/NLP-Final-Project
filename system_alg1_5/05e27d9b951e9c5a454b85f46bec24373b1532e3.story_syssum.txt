For one, every tech journalist on earth has been writing about the new-now-next-generation iPhone since the company's last "Jesus phone" -- the iPhone 4 -- graced us with its presence in June 2010.
And at the same time, we don't.
-- The iPhone may come to Sprint, too.
-- The phone will have a "teardrop" back, meaning it's fatter at the top than the bottom, according to the blog This is My Next.
-- It will have an upgraded, 8-megapixel rear camera.
-- It's possible Apple will unveil not one -- but TWO iPhones.
This is the first product announcement for Apple -- the world's most valuable company -- under the direction of its new CEO, Tim Cook.
But, like the rest of you, we'll just have to hang on until Tuesday -- when all these rumors get zapped with a dose of reality.
