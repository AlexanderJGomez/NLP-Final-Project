London (CNN) -- Depicting, among other things, Christ's procession to the cross, Spanish soldiers presiding over an execution in sixteenth-century Flanders and a mysterious mill perched atop a hollow cliff, Pieter Bruegel the Elder's 1564 painting "The Way to Calvary" is a complex, multi-layered work laden with symbolism and drama.
"For me, Bruegel is time," said the director.
The film, he explained, was composed of layers, because the Flanders of the painting is a surreal figment of the artist's imagination, comprising seven different perspectives.
The painting which inspired the film, Bruegel's "Procession to Calvary" is in the collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna.
