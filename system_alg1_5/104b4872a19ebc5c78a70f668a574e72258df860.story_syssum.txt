"I think it will change the whole industry," says Sengeh, who is from Sierra Leone.
"Seeing people who had lost their limbs and whose lives were just kind of cut short was very, very traumatizing," says Sengeh, who is from Bo, the West African country's second biggest city.
Next, he got into Harvard to study at its School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, before joining MIT's Media Lab.
Yet the lasting legacy of Sierra Leone's war has followed Sengeh all the way to the United States, shaping his innovative work to this day.
Whilst studying at Harvard he created his first NGO, called Global Minimum, a group encouraging Africans to solve their own problems, starting with malaria in Sierra Leone.
"We do have the talent and young people within Sierra Leone, within Africa as a whole, to invent the future," he says.
Those are what's instrumental.
