Today, unfortunately, many of our students are failing to learn American history, including our founding principles and values.
For two generations, we've watched our nation's memory of the past slip away.
These are frightening statistics, indicating that our children lack an understanding of our nation's history and the traits that have made America great.
I've found most young students to be energetic, enthusiastic and eager to learn.
They were models of sacrifice, civic-mindedness and determination.
Like children's books, educational video games, too, have enormous potential to make history come alive.
Yet we are for the first time in our history beginning to lose sight of our founders' sacrifice and wisdom.
