Langman, a shipyard owner and yachtsman, is intent on beating the French-set record within the next few weeks, with the "Wot Rocket," a canoe-style pod with a nine meter-long  rigid sail.
"The exhilaration of sailing/flying is so big, you don't think about danger," he told CNN.
In case the pilots crash again, Langman says the most thing is to remain calm.
I feel most 'in tune' when I'm on water," he added.
Finally, he teamed up with Wotif.com founder Graeme Wood who invested in the project because, as he explained,  he "likes leftfield ideas."
