The visitors had hoped to cement their strong position in this season's title battle with the return of Cristiano Ronaldo, who had been suspended for two matches following a sending off last month.
"We failed at everything, we lost all the tackles, all the high balls.
"Real Madrid cannot lose 4-0 against anyone," said Ronaldo.
Atletico coach Diego Simeone, meanwhile, was ecstatic at his team's performance.
