The last thing you want are your leaders not being tolerant," Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, told CNN before heading for the academy with Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Thad Allen.
Last week, after the incidents became public, academy superintendent Rear Adm. J. Scott Burhoe ordered the Coast Guard Investigative Service to investigate further.
"I want to say to them that they should not tolerate it amongst themselves, because they will be judged by their weakest link," he said.
"The noose, to African Americans, is a symbol of hatred and it takes us back to the times when African-American people were being hung from trees for no reason at all," Cummings said.
The Coast Guard Academy has about 980 cadets, about 14 percent of whom are minorities.
