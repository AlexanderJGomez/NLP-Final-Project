Since Myriad owns the patent on breast cancer genes, it was the only company that could perform tests for potential abnormalities.
Jolie had Myriad's breast cancer test.
Money was not an issue for them, but Kelly and Maxian, along with a coalition of physician groups and genetic counselors say Myriad has not made the BART tests widely available for patients without a strong family history of these kinds of cancers.
Because of cost, she waited 18 months before she could afford it, learning she carried a mutation, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented plaintiffs.
On one side of the Myriad case, scientists and companies argued patents encourage medical innovation and investment that saves lives.
Complementary DNA is artificially synthesized from the genetic template, and engineered to produce gene clones.
"Myriad did not create anything," said Thomas.
"Today, the court struck down a major barrier to patient care and medical innovation," said Sandra Park, senior staff attorney with the ACLU Women's Rights Project.
"I hope that this ruling will lead to more women at risk of breast cancer being able to get access to gene testing and to take control of their lives, not just in the U.S. but around the world -- whatever their means and whatever their background," she said.
