"Hey, they got the guy that hijacked us," said the voice on the phone.
"I can still remember very vividly," said Hopkins, 71.
He has the stewardess and held her with knifepoint at the base of her skull and he said, 'Cuba, Cuba, Cuba.'"
But the armed man was extremely nervous and shaking, Hopkins said.
"He said don't worry about it, we've done this before," Hopkins said.
On Sunday, 66-year-old hijacking suspect Pena Soltren surrendered to federal authorities at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport, the same airport from which Hopkins' flight was commandeered.
"I never thought I'd repeat this story again," Hopkins said.
Your mind is able to flush things once in awhile, until something happens and then you recall it."
