LePerruque, however, spoke glowingly of Jackson and after his first day of testimony last week he sought out Katherine Jackson to give his former boss's mother a hug.
Jackson called him between 20 and 30 times from his hotel room "in the middle of the night," LePerruque testified.
He appeared to be intoxicated, he said.
"I wouldn't be able to say that he was addicted to those," he answered.
"It was my concern that, yes, he may overdose," LePerruque said.
Jackson "fought very, very hard not to be on the prescription medications," LaPerruque testified.
"He said that as an artist he always had a tune in his head, different melodies, and he wasn't able to stop it," La Perruque said.
LaPerruque said Jackson was "very devastated" by what he thought was the betrayal of trust he had with Bashir.
"I came out in full support of him," LaPerruque said.
"There were times there were difficulties, but for the most part it was a pleasure working for him," he said.
