In recent years, the focus has been on the very serious challenges the ocean faces and the impact these challenges are already having on our daily lives.
In fact, the ocean can and should be a source of hope and solutions for a brighter future.
For the ocean to continue to do what's it's done for millions of years and serve the needs of a rapidly expanding human population, it needs to be healthy.
Big technology like renewable energy, carbon sequestration and advances in aquaculture certainly have a major role in restoring the ocean and the planet to a healthy balance, but in many cases it's a matter of giving nature the space and time to do what it needs to do with a helping hand from all of us.
If you are thinking this all sounds like the future of the ocean is in the hands of policymakers and big industry, please think again.
We can make sure the ocean continues to provide inspiration, wonder and solutions for generations, however, it all comes down to personal and collective will.
