(CNN) -- People were "thrown to the roof as if they were dolls" and some feared for their lives when a Continental Airlines flight ran into turbulence, shaken passengers said.
"The airplane came down very sharply, and all of us bumped our heads against the ceiling -- twice," Brazilian passenger Celi Dfaria told CNN affiliate WSVN-TV at Miami-Dade International Airport.
"While it was doing that, I saw people being thrown to the roof as if they were dolls."
Then I came down and I hit my back on the armrest, then I fell into the chair," he said.
Most of those who were injured had not been wearing seat belts, passengers said.
There were people cut, bleeding.
"I was lucky, though.
"It seemed like the back of the plane got it the worst, though, probably because there's more people in the back and a lot of people didn't have their seat belts on," Sharp told the Chronicle.
"I thought the plane was falling, just like a big earthquake, but in the air," he said.
"I think the most important thing about this whole episode is seat belts, all the time," Ottolini told KTRK-TV.
