(CNN)Much like the ardent young royal-watchers of today, enamored by the Duchess of Cambridge's very being, I was similarly captivated by Diana, Princess of Wales when I was a youngster.
The birth of any baby is cause for celebration, but given recent changes in the laws of succession, her arrival would be a historical one.
That said, in the event the couple do welcome a baby girl, I would hope that they do not opt to name her Diana.
Out of respect to the Queen, Charles, Camilla and the baby herself the couple simply wouldn't do it.
At his wedding in 2011 the Bishop of London, Richard Chartres, a close friend of Diana and executor of her will, gave the address.
William chose Kensington Palace, his own childhood home, to be the primary residence for his family, and in perhaps the most public acknowledgment of his mother's memory, he gave Kate Diana's engagement ring.
She would want her to go out into the world, to make her own mark and help those less fortunate, to enrich the lives of others and to carve out her own unique identity -- as Alice, Elizabeth, Victoria, Charlotte, or -- my own personal pick -- Alexandra.
