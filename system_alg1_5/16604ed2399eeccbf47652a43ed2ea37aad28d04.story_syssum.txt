The panel of health experts, which looked at how safe and effective antihistamines, decongestants, antitussins and expectorants are in children, said it is not appropriate to take data from adults and apply it to children under 12.
During the panel's meeting, the experts looked at a number of proposals, including whether multiple-symptom over-the-counter pediatric cough and cold medicines should be banned for children under 6 years old.
Dr. Daniel Rausch, director of the pediatric hospital program for New York University, said that cold medicine is effective only at doses that are too strong for young children.
"A cold does not kill, so people should just relax," Rausch said.
Potential misuse of the medications, not product safety, is driving the voluntary withdrawal, the group said.
"Parents can continue to trust over-the-counter cough and cold remedies for their children," said Linda A. Suydam, president of the Consumer Healthcare Products Association.
Until those deaths, he did not realize that a dose of cold medicine could turn into a life-and-death issue among young children, he said.
