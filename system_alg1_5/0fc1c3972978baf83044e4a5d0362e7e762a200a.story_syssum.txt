The state's Department of Correction said Michelle Kosilek, previously known as Robert, who is serving a life sentence without parole for murdering his wife in 1990, has a gender identity disorder.
It wasn't until 1999, when Kosilek first filed suit, that the court recognized her medical needs.
"[Kosilek]'s very excited and very, very pleased.
She's very glad the court has recognized her need for this surgery," Cohen said of her client.
The court ruling left it up to the Department of Correction to decide where Kosilek will be incarcerated after the surgery.
