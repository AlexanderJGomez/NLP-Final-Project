One of the accusers had once traveled with them to the Alamo Bowl, Dottie Sandusky said, where she and her husband shared a hotel room with the boy.
Sandusky, 68, is on trial on 51 counts related to accusations of sexually abusing 10 boys over a 15-year span.
But a second psychologist, Dr. John O'Brien, disputed those findings Tuesday, saying that the "personality profile Mr. Sandusky exhibited was within normal limits."
Early in the trial, Amendola implied that Sandusky would take the stand.
Sandusky routinely "got showers with kids" after working out, and he would say so later, Amendola said Monday.
"He gave him clothes, he gave him gifts," the mother of an accuser called Victim 9 testified.
"I didn't really want to hear," she said, crying.
"A lot of people lied," Amendola said last Monday in his opening statement.
On Monday, prosecutors dropped one of the 52 counts against Sandusky because the statute he was charged with wasn't in effect on the date of the alleged incident.
