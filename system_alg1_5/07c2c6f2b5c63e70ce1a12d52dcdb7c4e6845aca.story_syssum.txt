This was the latest twist in a case that has made international headlines, in part because of the circumstances of the killing but also because van der Sloot was arrested twice, but never charged, in the 2005 disappearance of U.S. teenager Natalee Holloway.
On Wednesday, van der Sloot is expected to finally give his plea in the Lima courtroom.
On Friday, prosecutors went over all the evidence and witnesses they had and gave a summation of the case against van der Sloot.
Van der Sloot was arrested twice but never charged in Holloway's disappearance, which is still unsolved.
The victim's family, including her father, Ricardo Flores, had pushed for stiffer charges and said that van der Sloot hasn't looked "remorseful" in court appearances.
If found guilty on all counts, van der Sloot could face a sentence of up to 30 years in prison.
