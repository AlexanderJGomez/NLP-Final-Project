In their natural state, the barrier islands that line about half of the U.S. coast, including most of the region affected by Sandy, are mobile and change constantly in response to wind, waves, tides and sea level.
When dunes erode and fail, much of the sand is carried up onto the island as overwash.
The sand washed onto and across the barrier islands, filling roads, yards and living rooms.
On a natural barrier island, this new elevation reduces the chance of inundation from the next storm.
But, everyone must understand that by resetting the island back to pre-storm conditions, the long-term risks are increased.
What we know about storms, sea-level rise and barrier island response can be applied to redevelopment of the New Jersey coast.
Doing nothing other than rebuilding is an easy choice and least expensive in the near-term, unless the next "superstorm" comes next year, or even this winter.
But, if undertaken jointly by citizens, policymakers and scientists, it could be a refreshing response and yield a coastal environment that is more resilient and economically and environmentally sound.
