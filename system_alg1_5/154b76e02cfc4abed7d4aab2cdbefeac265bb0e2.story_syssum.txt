As the al Qaeda leader's brother, he says they are ideologically inseparable, and that if anyone can talk his brother out of violence it's him.
He denies the charges.
He wants peace, he says, between Muslims and non-Muslims and has written a proposal that outlines the terms.
Al-Zawahiri says his offer puts him at risk from radical Islamists, but says he is not acting from weakness or for personal gain.
Back then he reportedly had disagreements with his brother about the way forward for the group.
Then came his came his arrest, long before 9/11, picked up, he says, by Egyptian authorities in the United Arab Emirates.
You have to be logical.
The cost, he says, of getting out of today's conflict must be paid.
