Gwenyth Jackaway started to wonder if Donor-X passed on a genetic component to her son, Dylan, who is autistic.
Gwenyth Jackaway, Dylan's mother, is a professor at New York's Fordham University.
What she couldn't know then is that her son would have autism.
"We wouldn't be able to screen a donor for autism because we don't yet know the specific genes that are contributing to autism," Dawson said.
"When you're handed a diagnosis of some sort of developmental disorder, you have to let go of the child you thought you were going to have," Jackaway said.
But I have this child instead, who's right here in front of me."
"She told me that she saw characteristics of autism, and it was very upsetting to me at that time," Pergola said.
I know I was scared, and she was there to let me know that it was going to be OK."
"She was terribly upset," Jackaway remembered.
"I love my son and everything about him, and that means loving his autism also.
"... per CCB policy, the donor's samples were removed from the general catalog.
In fact, Theresa Pergola says she's still uncertain about an autism screening process, if and when it ever becomes available.
It's really hard to say."
