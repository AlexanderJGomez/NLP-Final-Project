An official from Madrid, which won the Spanish league title last season, said the club could not comment as it had no information about Dando's statement.
One of the girls, Zahia Dehar, appeared on the cover of "Paris Match" magazine in April that year and in an interview said she had sexual relations with several players on the national team, including Ribery, whom she had met at the club.
"There is no evidence that he was ever aware of her age," Bottai said.
If found guilty, the players could face a prison term of up to three years, or a fine of â‚¬45,000 ($58,390).
