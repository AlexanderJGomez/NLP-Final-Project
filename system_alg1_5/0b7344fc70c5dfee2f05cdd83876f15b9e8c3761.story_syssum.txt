A day after the first protest blaze was put out, prisoners in the same prison once again set fires in the dormitories, this time injuring 42, according to the semi-official Anatolian Agency.
"Overcrowding is the primary problem," said Ozturk Turkdogan, president of the Human Rights Foundation in Turkey, or IHD, pointing out that the Sanliurfa prison is equipped to house 375 prisoners but currently houses nearly 1,200.
"When I was in the prison, at first we were six people in a six-person room, which was fine.
Turkey is in the process of upgrading its prison system and will increase its capacity nearly twofold by 2017, according to officials.
"The capacity to respond to these complaints, to take measures to prevent the kind of tragedy that happened at the (Sanliurfa) prison, we are not seeing at the moment," said Sinclair-Webb.
Sanliurfa prison has been in the headlines before.
