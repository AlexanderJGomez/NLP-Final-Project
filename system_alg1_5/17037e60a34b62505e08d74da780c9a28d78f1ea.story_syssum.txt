There are no neon signs, no hotels or restaurants with names that you will recognize, just charming local businesses set on cobblestone streets.
Narrow chutes frame the streets and carry water from the mountaintops through town, toward the railroad tracks, and into the Urubamba River.
But visitors can't be expected to stand on a street corner taking in the view all day, and thankfully, there is plenty to do in this old Incan village.
The main attraction, the Ollantaytambo Ruins, a former Incan fortress, attracts busloads of day trippers that unload by the market.
If you want a break from the ruins, try white-water rafting, mountain climbing or horseback riding.
A hearty local dish, lomo saltado, is served in most restaurants.
There are enough restaurants to choose from, and in some establishments, the food is as good as the fancy places you will find in Cusco.
Whether you take the bus, train or taxi, consider a stop in this impressive Incan town as you check the nearby world wonder off your list.
