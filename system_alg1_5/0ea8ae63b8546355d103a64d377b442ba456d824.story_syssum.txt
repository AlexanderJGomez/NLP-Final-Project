In a new attack on Google, Microsoft's Bing search engine accuses its rival's Google Shopping tool of being dishonest by only including paying vendors, ranking listings by how much they pay, and not clearly marking the results as sponsored.
Simply put, all of their shopping results are now paid ads," reads the campaign's mission statement.
"The primary point is, we think they should stop the practice of pay to rank, or at least make it very clear what's going on," said Stefan Weitz, senior director at Bing.
By default, both sites sort shopping search results by their own custom "relevancy" algorithms.
"If you actually were looking at pure price, they would be more comparable," said Weitz.
As a result, the quality of the individual product search results should improve.
The trade-off is that it is missing some major retailers that do not want to pay to play, most notably Google's actual biggest competitor when it comes to online shopping, Amazon.
"This was meant to be a fairly lighthearted holiday campaign," explained Weitz.
Seasonal hijinks aside, Weitz said he has real concerns that this could be the start of a trend at Google, spreading to other Google services such as news.
