A two-day job fair to fill some 500 part-time jobs during the baseball season, from stadium security to hawking beer during the games, attracted nearly 7,000 applicants.
Despite a lower turnout, this year's crowd was "significantly more" than similar job fairs in previous years, team officials said, although no numbers for previous years were released.
"This is supposed to be the golden years, whatever that means," Reider said, adding, "I am in excellent health, and I don't mind working and I got a good cause.
"It is very difficult to live on what we have today," he declared, noting the difficulty of the job search.
On both days, applicants were handed individual, numbered wristbands at the entrance to the stadium.
At the Dodgertown Job Fair, though, spirits were high.
"Don't wait for more," he said.
"Take the money now."
