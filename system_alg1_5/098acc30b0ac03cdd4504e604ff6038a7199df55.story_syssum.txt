(CNN) -- Sweden's military feels certain there was an intruder, but it has called off the search for a mystery vessel in waters near Stockholm.
Government officials have not said what they believed they had detected, but Sweden's media reported the military was probably looking for a Russian submarine.
According to a report, the Dutch said they did not had a sub in Swedish waters.
The news of the military's search had Schmidt's business phone ringing, mostly with annoying calls.
CNN's Ralph Ellis, Lucy Pawle, Brad Lendon and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.
