LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's memorial service will take place Tuesday morning in the Staples Center, the 20,000-seat coliseum in downtown Los Angeles where Jackson rehearsed his show the night before he died, according to a person who has been briefed by a representative of the family.
Katherine Jackson's 40 percent share would go to Michael Jackson's three children after her death, the source said.
Gregory Son, a 31-year-old musician, was among many fans who had planned to ride to the ranch to say goodbye to Jackson.
Officially, a DEA spokeswoman referred questions to the Los Angeles, California, police department -- which would not confirm the involvement.
"However, at this time, we have nothing further to comment about the death of Michael Jackson."
"Based on our agreement with Los Angeles investigators, we are waiting on real information to come from viable sources like the Los Angeles medical examiner's office about the death of Michael Jackson," the statement said.
"I told him this medication is not safe," said Cherilyn Lee, a registered nurse.
Singer Ross, 65, is a lifelong friend of Jackson's.
He helped acquire Jackson's music catalog, which is worth millions.
