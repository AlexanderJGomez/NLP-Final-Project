Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions at some of its clinics, and fellow plaintiff Marcela Balquinta of McAllen, Texas, had filed the request for a temporary restraining order seeking exclusion from the new law, arguing the organization provides preventative women's health care not associated with abortions to nearly 50,000 Texas enrollees annually.
"Today's ruling finally clears the way for thousands of low-income Texas women to access much-needed care, while at the same time respecting the values and laws of our state," he said.
With the temporary restraining order denial, women may not be able to access care through the Texas Women's Health Program at Planned Parenthood clinics, pending the result of the January 11 hearing.
We only wish Texas politicians shared this commitment to Texas women, their health, and their wellbeing."
