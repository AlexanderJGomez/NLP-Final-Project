Gbagbo's residence is near the state-run television station  taken over by Ouattara forces in the early morning hours Friday, said Patrick Achi, the Ouattara spokesman.
The curfew, Ouattara said, will remain in effect until Sunday.
After the announcement, however, the station went dark, Ibrahim said.
It will be only "hours, maybe days" before Gbagbo falls, Achi said.
Choi Young-jin, head of the United Nations' mission in Ivory Coast, said on France Info radio that U.N. peacekeepers have taken the place of army and police who abandoned Gbagbo on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Gbagbo's army chief, Gen. Philippe Mangou, asked for asylum at the residence of the South African ambassador, the South African government said Thursday.
"In order to end the escalating violence in our country, the Republican Forces of Ivory Coast have started to put in place, in accordance with their missions, the protection of people and their property against the militia men and mercenaries paid by Laurent Gbagbo," Ouattara said.
"Everybody is calling it the battle of Abidjan," said Kouakou.
The U.N. resolution demands that Gbagbo step down immediately and that all state institutions, including the military, accept Ouattara as president.
All but Laurent Gbagbo are accused of "public incitement to hatred and violence."
