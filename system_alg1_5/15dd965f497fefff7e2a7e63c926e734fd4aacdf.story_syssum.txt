Thank you.
Here's what I did, with what I learned at the clinic in South Africa, and my mother, Yasmin's help.
Lunch and dinner: Stir-fry vegetables (celery, carrots, French beans, corn, cabbage, broccoli) in one desert spoon of olive oil along with fresh herbs, like basil, rosemary, oregano and fresh coriander, salt and pepper to taste.
Grilled lamb with salt, pepper and honey -- white sauce over it, (made with wholewheat flour, milk and seasoning).
Munchies: Carrots, salad, pear, apple, avocado, sunflower seeds, Barvita biscuits, snack bars that are oatmeal (no preservatives or coloring or flavoring).
I imagined making a deal with my psoriasis, I would maintain the diet, and it, in turn would go away.
I visualized that all the time.
The only universal truth in all this, for me, is maintaining a positive attitude no matter how hard it is, with the love and support of friends and family.
Once again, thank you.
