"Disabled children -- they're really the forgotten ones in this war," said Blauser, 43.
"There's no paycheck.
But this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," he said.
There's not a doctor available for help [and] there's no pediatric wheelchair source in this country," Blauser said.
" Blauser recalled.
"The experience for me in the first distribution was awesome," said Blauser.
"When I heard the news of the distribution of these advanced wheelchairs, I was very happy deep down," she said.
Since 2005, Wheelchairs for Iraqi Kids has distributed nearly 650 pediatric wheelchairs.
The organization provides wheelchairs designed for rough terrains in developing nations, making the devices "perfect for this environment," said Blauser.
"By providing what they need, I'm hoping to start a movement to change the way people think about disabled children," said Blauser.
