We are accustomed to thinking of the argument between left and right as an ideological or philosophical debate, so it has no "correct" answer.
The answer is simple and unequivocal: Happier people live in countries with a generous social safety net, or, more generally, countries whose governments  "tax and spend" at higher rates, reflecting the greater range of services and protections offered by the state.
This is borne out by the U.N. 2013 "World Happiness Report," which found Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden the top five happiest nations.
Critically, "big government" and labor unions also promote happiness not merely for those toward the bottom or middle of the income distribution, but for everyone, rich and poor, men and women, conservatives and liberals.
People who live in states with higher welfare spending, more organized labor, more liberal state governments, more regulation of business, and a greater recent history of control by the Democratic Party, are all more satisfied with their lives, regardless of income, and again when controlling for other factors that are likely to affect well-being.
Whatever else unions and liberal public policies might do, they help make the world a better place to the extent that we believe  human happiness is the appropriate metric to  measure such judgments.
