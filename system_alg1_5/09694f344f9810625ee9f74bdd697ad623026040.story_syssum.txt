Police arrested 25 people following the violence, said Husted, most of them from extreme left-wing groups.
The far-right rally brought together protesters from the Danish Defense League, as well as smaller groups from Scandinavian countries, Germany, Poland, Eastern Europe and the United Kingdom.
"We are going to support anyone who is going to talk and to demonstrate for what they feel, according to Danish law," he said.
Racists and neo-Nazis are not welcome, and those supporting the rally have signed an agreement against extremism, it said.
