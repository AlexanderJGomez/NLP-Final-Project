"The surgery went well," says a source close to the show.
In April, Phillips' father, Donnie, told Albany Uncovered that "contestants are getting very little sleep and it's starting to take a toll on Phillip, especially when combined with his ongoing kidney stone issues."
Phillips was reportedly scheduled to go under the knife last week, but due to a fever and sinus infection, the surgery had to be delayed.
Our get-well-soon wishes go out to Phillip; he's got a whole lot of fans hoping to hear him sing again soon.
