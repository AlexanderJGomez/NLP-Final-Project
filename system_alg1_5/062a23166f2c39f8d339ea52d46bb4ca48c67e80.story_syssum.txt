For four people, including her 5-month-old boy, it was too late.
Had it not been for her going for help, more victims might have died, said Clifford Dalton, a paramedic for LifeMed Alaska.
Dalton said he and his partner, Paul Garnet, helped treat the patients at the site.
Concerned residents also came to help from Mountain Village, about 25 miles away, where most of the victims were from.
Also injured was Kylan Johnson, 14, who was treated and released.
