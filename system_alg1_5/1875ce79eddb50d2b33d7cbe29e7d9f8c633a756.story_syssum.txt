"And then you think what a challenge, what an honor to be able to fill the shoes of someone like Larry King -- for me as a TV interviewer, which is primarily what I do back in England.
Morgan will replace King's longtime show with "a candid, in-depth newsmaker interview program," CNN announced Wednesday.
"Larry King would be it," Morgan said.
King announced this summer that he was stepping aside from CNN's "Larry King Live," a show he began hosting in 1985.
Morgan, 45, began his journalism career as a newspaper reporter in the United Kingdom for The Wimbledon News.
In addition, he will provide regular columns to CNN.com, the network said.
