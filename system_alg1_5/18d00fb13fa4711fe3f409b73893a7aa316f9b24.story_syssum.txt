Much more than an overnight sensation like "Tickle Me Elmo," "The Wiggles," have stayed a children's favorite for 16 years.
"They are themselves," she says, "and children can relate to them."
She appreciates the content that her son is absorbing,  and likens the Wiggles to "the teacher that wants to do all the cool stuff and has the money to do it."

"I must admit I was a little excited myself," she confesses.
"You could almost touch them," she says.
