WHAT IT IS "I call this haircut a 'shab,'" says hairstylist Giannandrea, who created this look for the star.
WHO SHOULD TRY IT "Minus the bangs, this would be a great short cut for someone with curly hair," said hairstylist Mark Townsend.
"Because the hair covers the ears, the cut looks feminine," says Townsend.
"The little details in this cut will really be accentuated if you have fine, baby soft hair," says Townsend.
WHO SHOULD TRY IT "This a a great look for someone with thick hair," Townsend says.
"Because her bangs have those choppy ends, the straight line isn't too severe," says Townsend.
"Heidi's hair is mid-length, which can get a little dowdy, but because of the dimensional layers sliced throughout, it has a great shape and isn't one bit matronly," Townsend says.
WHO SHOULD TRY IT "I love this for anyone with tons of fine hair -- the kind of woman with a ponytail that's two-inches thick," Townsend says.
If you can commit to the styling, it's ultimately a very low effort cut," says Townsend.

Keep things sophisticated, not streaky, by making sure the highlights are ultra-fine and placed evenly throughout the entire head, even on the underside of your hair.
It's ombre, but without being severe.
Ask your colorist for a few hidden streaks on the underside of your hair for a playful, peek-a-boo surprise.
It's simple and believable, but not at all boring."
Ask your colorist for the deepest shade of brunet, not black, which is too severe and heavy metal for the look you're after.
