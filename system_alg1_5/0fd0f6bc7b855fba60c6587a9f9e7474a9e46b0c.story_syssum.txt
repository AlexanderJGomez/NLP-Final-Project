John Hickenlooper said.
Some people in Lyons still were awaiting rescue, evacuees said, and some residents had chosen to stay.
In Fort Collins, some residents had been urged to leave their homes.
"All residents are warned to go to higher ground immediately due to the potential for flash flooding along the creek," Boulder's Office of Emergency Management said.
"This is not going to get fixed in a week," he said.
