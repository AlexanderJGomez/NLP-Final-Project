New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Pakistan's prime minister, Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani, arrived in India Wednesday to watch a Cricket World Cup match between the two archrival teams as the nuclear neighbors try to repair ties wounded by the 2008 terror attacks on Mumbai.
In their talks Tuesday in New Delhi, Indian and Pakistani home secretaries also pledged to set up a "hotline" on terror threats.
In their discussions, Indian home secretary Pillai briefed the Pakistani side on his country's investigations into a deadly bombing of a Pakistan-bound train, about 80 kilometers from New Delhi, four years ago.
"Both sides reiterated their commitment to fight terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and reaffirmed the need to bring those responsible for such crimes to justice," the statement said.
