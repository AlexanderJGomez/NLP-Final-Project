(CNN) -- Campaign 2014 is in full swing with primary voting, and incumbents and challengers busy raising money.
"Every time this current Supreme Court has confronted a campaign finance restriction, it's struck it down," said Thomas Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog.com.
"Because individuals' direct contributions are limited, would-be donors may turn to other avenues for political speech" than direct contributions to office-seekers, said Roberts.
"Individuals can, for example, contribute unlimited amounts to 501(c) organizations, which are not required to publicly disclose their donors.
He equates his donations to "core political speech."
"The reason we have limitations on the dollars an individual can give is to create some sense of fairness, so that if we do have a campaign finance system driven by donations, we have as many opportunities for as many people as possible to participate," said Robert Zimmerman, a prominent Democratic fundraiser.
But it continues a trend that culminated in the separate "Citizens United" high court ruling from 2010, easing long-standing restrictions on "independent spending" by corporations, labor unions, and certain non-profit advocacy groups in political campaigns.
All PACs are organizations that campaign either for or against candidates, legislation, or ballot measures.
With a resounding win at the high court, wealthy donors like McCutcheon -- whether Democrat, Republican, or Independent -- could in theory contribute a maximum $3.6 million to the national and state parties, and the 450 or so Senate and House candidates expected to run in 2014.
Loosening those limits, say opponents of the law, would benefit wealthy liberals and conservatives equally.
Unlike in "Citizens United," the big winners may be harder to discern.
"Getting rid of the aggregate limits is not about corrupting democracy -- it is about practicing democracy," he said.
