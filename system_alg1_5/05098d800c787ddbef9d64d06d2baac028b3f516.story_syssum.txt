A U.S. drone Wednesday fired on an area in northwestern Pakistan, according to two Pakistani intelligence sources and a witness.
The militants said the attack was carried out with the Pakistani Taliban, which has confirmed that members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan conducted the Karachi airport attack, Pakistani Taliban commander Abdullah Bahar Mehsud told CNN in a phone conversation.
The attackers fled, and no one was killed in the attack, officials said.
Once again, the Pakistani Taliban, which is formally known as Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP,  claimed responsibility.
By Tuesday afternoon, the situation was "under control," military spokesman Asim Bajwa said.
At least 15 militants were killed in the airstrikes on Khyber Agency, in tribal areas bordering Afghanistan, the Pakistani military said.
"Their primary target is the Pakistani state and its military," said Raza Rumi of the Jinnah Institute, a Pakistani think tank.
Four years later, Hakimullah Mehsud suffered the same fate.
