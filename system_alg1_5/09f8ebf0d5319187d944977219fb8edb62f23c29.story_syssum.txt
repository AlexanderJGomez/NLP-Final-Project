(CNN) -- As South Carolina Republicans begin voting in the first primary of the south today, GOP insiders say that all the candidates have had their problems in Palmetto State, one reason why today's outcome has been so hard to predict.
Mitt Romney's biggest hurdles in South Carolina are his Massachusetts political roots and his more centrist views.
"The two big issues that stick out to me regarding his record are his flip-flopping on abortion which many voters in South Carolina don't understand, and of course his signing of 'Romney-care,' " said one South Carolina insider.
And while Gingrich maintains that he's the logical alternative for conservatives, the former House Speaker's problem has been that, up until Thursday, there were two other options for South Carolina voters who were uneasy with Romney -- former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and Texas Gov Rick Perry, who has since suspended his campaign.
"Newt's populism resonates with red-meat voters in South Carolina, but the Romney-alternative field (has been) too crowded for him to lock down a solid win here," said one GOP insider.
"The biggest obstacle for all the 'not-Romney' candidates has been in a word, 'ego,' " said one GOP Insider.
What do you think has been the biggest obstacle for Paul in South Carolina?
"Because of this and other stands, no one takes him seriously outside of his hard-core supporters," said one GOP Insider.
And while some insiders were aligned with one or another of the presidential campaigns, two-thirds said they had neither endorsed nor were they working for any candidate in the race.
