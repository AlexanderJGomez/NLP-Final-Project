The search began Thursday after Swedish intelligence picked up an emergency radio call in Russian, reported The Local, citing the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet.
The radio transmissions were being sent to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, 330 miles (530 kilometers) south of Stockholm on the Baltic's southern shore, according to The Local report.
On Monday, the Swedish military vowed to continue searching at least for the next few days, according to The Local.
"They could also be installing equipment, like sensors, that could track or get an observation of our units in that area," he goes on.
In fact, the Swedish military said Sunday that it has monitored suspicious activity for several years, according to another report in The Local.
On June 4, according to U.S. defense officials, four long-range Russian Tu-95 bombers, accompanied by an aerial refueling tanker, flew into the U.S. Air Defense Identification Zone, an area extending 200 miles (320 kilometers) from the North American coast, off Alaska, where they were intercepted by U.S. F-22 fighter jets.
Those Russian planes came within about 40 nautical miles of the Canadian coastline, he said.
