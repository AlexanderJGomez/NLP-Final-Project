(CNN) -- Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf came to power in a bloodless military coup in 1999 when he was chief of Pakistan's army.
Like most Muslims, Musharraf's family moved to Pakistan when British India was divided into India and Pakistan, and settled in Karachi.
It was during his stint as the country's military chief that there was an opening for Musharraf's political ascendancy, when in 1999 the then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif dismissed him after the army's failed invasion in Kargil, in Indian-administered Kashmir.
Four months later, Musharraf implemented 29 amendments to the constitution, granting himself the power to dissolve parliament and remove the prime minister.
But, analysts say, Musharraf never lost his military mindset.
The next month, he declared a state of emergency, suspended Pakistan's constitution, replaced the chief judge again and blacked out independent TV outlets.
He allowed Sharif, the prime minister he deposed, to return from exile.
Meanwhile, several other factors compounded Musharraf's declining popularity: a shortage of essential food items, power cuts, and skyrocketing inflation.
Six months later, the coalition moved to impeach Musharraf, who then resigned as president, though he said the allegations of misconduct were false.
Government officials said that if he returned, he'd be arrested.
Musharraf's attorney, Chaudry Faisal, said the threat of arrest is politically motivated and has no legal bearing.
He spoke about the possibility of arrest, but said he expects he will be fine, so long as "the judiciary plays its just role, and there are no interruptions."
I need to muster all the support I can," he said.
