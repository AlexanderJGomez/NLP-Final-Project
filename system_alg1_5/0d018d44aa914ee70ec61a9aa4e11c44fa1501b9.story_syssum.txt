The levee, near the city of Portage in Columbia County, began to give way Sunday night, according to the National Weather Service's Milwaukee/Sullivan office.
Roadways, including parts of Interstate 39, could close.
"Emergency vehicles including police, fire and EMS will not be able to reach residents," the statement said.
The river at Portage is now expected to stay above flood stage -- 17 feet -- through Wednesday, Beghin said.
But the levee system, built in the 1890s, was constructed from locally available materials -- mostly sand -- "without any engineering design or adherence to any standards," the Natural Resources department said in a statement last week.
Portage itself, however, did not receive any of the heavy rain.
"Even though some of these rivers have crested ... keep in mind that they're still in flood, so this is going to be a problem for a couple of days," Jeras said.
