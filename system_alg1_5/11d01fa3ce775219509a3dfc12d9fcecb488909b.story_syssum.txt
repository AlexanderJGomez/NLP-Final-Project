Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN)A dispute over natural gas supply flared Friday between Russia and Ukraine, even as a ceasefire between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine appeared to be taking hold.
The leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Zacharchenko, said separatist forces there had withdrawn 90% of their heavy weapons.
Russia's Tass state news agency said that Gazprom confirmed receiving $15 million Friday in prepayment from Ukraine.
A meeting between the European Union, Russia and Ukraine is due to take place in Brussels, Belgium, on Monday to discuss gas supply to Ukraine.
However, now that the worst of winter is over, the threat of a halt in the supply of gas is less alarming than it was for Ukraine and for the rest of Europe.
However, the OSCE needs more information in order to monitor their withdrawal effectively, he said, including what heavy weapons each side has, where they are now and where they will be taken.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of arming and training the separatists, as well as sending Russian troops over the border to fight with them.
