Pilot Sam Egli took John Paskievitch, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, and Lopez, a post-doctoral researcher, about 6,500 feet up the volcano on Wednesday.
"There were blue skies when we landed," she said.
"We grabbed our stuff and got in the helicopter," Lopez said, but even in the few minutes that took visibility became too poor for takeoff.
"Even though it wasn't that cold, it was pretty foul when you were outside," Lopez said.
"It was such a relief hearing them up there even when they couldn't get in," she said.
