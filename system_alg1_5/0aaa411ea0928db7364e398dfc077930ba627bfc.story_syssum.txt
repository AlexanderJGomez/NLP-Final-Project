Scientists hope to glean more clues about the origin and evolution of the universe, and in particular our own galaxy, after a camera of this incredible scale -- fitted to the Gaia space telescope -- was launched Thursday.
It's the biggest camera ever put into space," said Ralph Cordey, head of science and exploration at Astrium.
If successful, Gaia will add to the knowledge gained from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, which is still in operation, and ESA's Hipparcos satellite, which gathered data until 1993.
"We are designing missions that could probably do that very thing -- it's not science fiction," said Cordey.
