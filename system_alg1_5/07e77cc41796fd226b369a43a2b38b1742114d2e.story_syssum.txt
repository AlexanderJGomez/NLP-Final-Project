Stephens' lawsuit is "meritless and barred by the statute of limitations," Clash lawyer Michael Berger told CNN Tuesday.
"I am a gay man," Clash, 52, said in a statement in November.
"Clash was an adult male living a prominent public life centered around the entertainment of toddlers, while at the same time he was, in secret, preying on teenage boys to satisfy his depraved sexual interests," the Stephens suit alleged.
"Clash smoked crystal meth while engaging in sexual activity with Sheldon," the lawsuit said.
"Clash told Sheldon he would help Sheldon with his acting career," it said.
Despite his stepping down, Clash's voice will be used for Elmo through 2014, as the next season of "Sesame Street" has already been filmed.
