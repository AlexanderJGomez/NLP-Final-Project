(CNN) -- It was supposed to be a couple's little getaway, on a little plane, from upstate New York to the Florida coast.
At that time, the plane was somewhere above Statesville, North Carolina, about 600 miles south of the Rochester, New York, airport it left from around 8:45 a.m. destined for Naples, Florida.
The pilot asks to descend to 18,000 feet because "we have an indication that is not correct in the plane," according to a stream of that transmission posted on LiveATC.net.
Until sometime before 2:15 p.m., that is, by which point estimates suggested the fuel would have run out.
By early evening, Jamaican authorities had found an oil slick in the prime search area that -- at that point -- was the only possible sign of the downed aircraft, according to Maj.
As they searched, the Glazer family of Rochester, New York, mourned.
A post on Women Entrepreneurs Blog, which is produced in conjunction with the University of Rochester's business school, notes that she ran the New York City Marathon, did whitewater rafting and learned how to fly a plane -- all in addition to raising three children and building her business.
While authorities don't know everything that went on inside the plane, including what caused it to crash, they have spoken about what they did in response.
The Cuban government even let the U.S. Coast Guard's C-130 aircraft go through its airspace and also gave permission for American "military aircraft, if necessary," according to an official statement.
