"Mr. Scott never tried to fight," Santana told CNN.
Police said Slager used a Taser against Scott, but Slager would also later tell a dispatcher that Scott at some point had grabbed the Taser.
When Santana's video begins, Scott starts running away from the officer, with Scott's back to Slager.
"He was there.
"I think she was right," he said.

His attorney, Todd Rutherford, said Santana's video would be useful in an investigation -- not only into the shooting but also into whether Scott received prompt medical attention.
