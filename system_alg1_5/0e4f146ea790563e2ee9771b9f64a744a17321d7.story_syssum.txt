Tom Waits in Paris on the European leg of his tour.
It is the same world that Kerouac chronicled in his writings, including his most famous work "On the Road," which describes a journey across America in the late fifties.
Waits' place in the folk tradition is something he has acknowledged, consciously or otherwise, in his music.
"I was picking up people's conversations in all-night coffee shops - ambulance drivers, cabdrivers, street sweepers," he said in an interview with The New Yorker.
"Bukowski had a story that essentially was saying that it's the little things that drive men mad," Waits said.
"This is a lopsided love song," he rasped, introducing the next track.
Lopsided or not, it's an authentic voice we could surely do with hearing more from.
