Senator Bennett Johnston, a Democrat who beat back a challenge from Duke in 1990, said even he didn't know that  EURO as "a racist organization."
"Sometimes you end up in front of these groups through no fault of your own and there are racial undertones," said Edwards, who lost a runoff this month to serve in the House, in an interview with the New York Times.
Scalise called the appearance at European-American Unity and Rights Organization (EURO), a white supremacist group founded by Duke, a former Klu Klux Klan grand wizard, a "mistake I regret" and said the group was one of many he addressed when he was a state senator crisscrossing the state to drum up support for a piece of legislation.
While David Duke defends Scalise, Speaker Boehner and Leader McCarthy are refusing to condemn Scalise's choice of allies," Schwerin said.
