In early January, the fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, met with Bristol County, Massachusetts, prosecutors in what court documents call an immunity meeting, but the results of that meeting are secret, even from the Hernandez defense team.
Jenkins has been a regular at hearings for Hernandez.
"Normally, a fiancée is not going to testify adversely against her true love," said Callan, a former New York homicide prosecutor.
Prosecutors said Jenkins, Hernandez's high school sweetheart, lied to a grand jury several times about the presence of guns in their North Attleboro home, among other issues.
Jenkins' sister Shaneah was dating Lloyd, 27, who was shot six times, according to prosecutors.
When Jenkins returned home, she was seen on the same security system but without the "rigid" item.
It has not been found.
"It could be drugs, it could be something that was connected to this crime that he knew about, that he was covering up for somebody else after the fact.
"It's going to increase her guilt if the prosecutor pursues perjury charges," Callan said.
