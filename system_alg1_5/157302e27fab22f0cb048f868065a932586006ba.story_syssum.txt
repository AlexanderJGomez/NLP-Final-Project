Plus, "they're just attractive to look at," says Dr. Eric Kandel, a biochemistry and biophysics professor at Columbia University.
Dr. Eric Kandel: There are two forms (of memory).
I'm thinking, 'That's the seat of complex memory, and I want to get complicated.'
But after a while, we realized that studying the cells in a region involved in memory is necessary but not sufficient.
And when we tried to see what comes into the hippocampus, we found it very complicated to analyze.
But if you have a long-term memory, you alter the expression of genes in the brain and you grow new synaptic connections.
Kandel: Yes and no.
We can learn things that they can't learn, obviously.
Kandel: I had no interest in science whatsoever.
I remember having dinner with my wife before we were married and telling her, 'You know, I can see doing this for the rest of my life, but it's ridiculous.
But that, at the moment, was quite inspirational.
With Alzheimer's disease, you lose explicit memory, complicated memory, so he would have difficulty recognizing people.
He couldn't recognize people, places.
It's amazing.
And it is so important that we understand it, not only to understand ourselves and who we are, but also to be able to overcome many of the miseries that affect the brain.
So I think it's wonderful.
With Alzheimer's disease, I think the understanding is surprisingly good.
Or, and I think this is a real possibility, we are starting to treat people too late in the disorder.
Kandel: Well, you know, it's a relative thing.
There's much, much more to be studied, and much, much more to be learned.
