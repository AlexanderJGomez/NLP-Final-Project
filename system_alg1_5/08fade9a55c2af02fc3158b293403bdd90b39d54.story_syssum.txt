Meetings between Zuckerberg, 27, and Instagram head Kevin Systrom, 28, that took place at Zuckerberg's multi-million-dollar Palo Alto, California, home.
"On balance, I'm not sure it's the best way to do business," said Ali Velshi, CNN's chief business correspondent.
Velshi, who over the course of his career covered the "tech bubble" of the late 1990s, said the whirlwind purchase may, in fact, be a last hurrah of sorts for Zuckerberg.
The board, one source said, "was told, not consulted."
"Creativity, innovation and deal-making are different strengths; rarely does one person possess all of them," he said.
And, for Facebook, making a profit directly from Instagram may have been less important than locking up its user data and taking a rapidly growing competitor, now with more than 40 million users, off of the playing field.
