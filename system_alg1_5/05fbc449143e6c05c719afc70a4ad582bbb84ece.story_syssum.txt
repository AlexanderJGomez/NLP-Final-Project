Indeed, Francis seems sincere and acknowledges the complicity of the institutional church in the cover-up, not just the actions of individual men.
His predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, met on several occasions with victims, including during a trip to the United States.
Of course, a good apology includes not only acknowledgment of personal and/or corporate responsibility for the victim's pain, but also a promise to fix things, or at least to not continue to inflict that pain.
The church is finally, after decades of denying or minimizing victims' pain, accepting responsibility.
If that's true, it will be the victims who will be the real saints, not the apologizers.
