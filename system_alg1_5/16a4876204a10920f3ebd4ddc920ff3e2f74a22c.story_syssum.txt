Last week, a 25-year follow-up of the Canadian National Breast Screening Study was published -- one of the eight major randomized trials of screening mammography.
The investigators were cheating: Let's look at the background on this.
In 1997, the review found no credible evidence of cheating.
For mammographers who need to point to the benefits demonstrated by earlier trials of mammography, this is an odd allegation.
In fact, one of the trials most favorable to screening -- the Health Insurance Plan of New York's -- dates from two decades before Canada's, in the early 1960s, when mammography technologies were primitive.
To be clear, not all mammographers share this view.
In the Canadian trial, one group received a regular physical exam of the breast -- a very careful exam performed by specially trained nurses.
That's really important information.
It does mean, however, that if we are going to do mammography, we should be using it to find big, important things -- not small, unimportant things.
Because so much of DCIS represents overdiagnosis, including it makes the estimate even higher.
It's too much like asking the dentists for balanced information about routine dental X-rays.
