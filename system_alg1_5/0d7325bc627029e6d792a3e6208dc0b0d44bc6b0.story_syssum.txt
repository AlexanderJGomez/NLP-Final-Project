Nor is it about the board.
In 2012 in Charlottesville, Virginia, we see a similar confrontation.
By ignoring the faculty and students, the board showed a disregard for their standing, and that is perceived as a critical act of rudeness.
The rehiring of the president after a special emergency meeting of the board is a victory for the president, of course, but more significant, it is a victory for the concept of a governance system in which all parties who have a genuine interest in the maintenance of the university are given an opportunity to play their part, to express their thinking and have it inform the future of their institution.
In the case at the University of Virginia, the leader of the board, Helen Dragas, was exposed as having disregarded "the way we do things."
I cannot help to think how ironic it is that this battle has two women in opposition, Sullivan and Dragas.
Today, it is merely a political battle.
