We don't usually think of "Brokeback Mountain" director Ang Lee as an effects filmmaker, but he gave us the romantic swordplay above swaying bamboo forests in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and, less happily, "Hulk" bouncing across the desert like a rubber ball.
But it's more than that.
Underneath, too.
The movie's Pi (Suraj Sharma) is considerably more circumspect than the novel's, and understandably so -- Richard Parker is more ferocious in the flesh than he was on the page.
Even then, to his credit, Ang Lee is never tempted to domesticate this cat, except briefly, when both boy and beast are starving and at death's door.
