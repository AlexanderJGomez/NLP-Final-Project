Some 10,000 people marched on the country's parliament Tuesday to express their anger at the teenager's death, and also other issues like the economy, jobs, and allegations that the government is corrupt.
The shooting occurred in a neighborhood where there have been regular clashes with police, but it immediately sparked clashes and riots in Athens and Thessaloniki, the country's second-largest city.
Opposition leader George Papandreou of the left-wing PASOK party said: "The country does not have a government that can protect its citizens, their rights, or their safety.
"It's our responsibility to maintain a united stance against illegal acts," he said in statement.
"We must condemn in the strongest terms, with pure reason and not minced words - the violence, pillaging, and vandalism, that hampers social peace."
Karamanlis vowed again Tuesday that those responsible for the violence would be punished.
There were 10 flashpoints across Athens where police confronted rioters, police said.
Demonstrators torched government buildings and the offices of the ruling conservative party in central Athens.
Government officials, including the interior minister, have condemned the shooting.
Authorities conducted an autopsy on the boy Monday in an effort to clarify the circumstances of the shooting, but the boy's family has called in their own investigators to verify state findings, the Athens coroner told CNN.
