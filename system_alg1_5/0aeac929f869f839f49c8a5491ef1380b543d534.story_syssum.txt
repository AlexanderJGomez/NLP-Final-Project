The reasons are as numerous as the passel of pills on the market: anxiety, depression, chronic illness, restless legs syndrome, sleep apnea, everyday exhaustion ... the list goes on and on.
Here, the answers.
A: More than a third of Americans experience occasional insomnia, which is defined as a few nights of restlessness, poor sleep, or trouble falling asleep.
"Often people attribute everything bad that happens to them, including being angry and crabby, to lack of sleep," says Donna Arand, Ph.D., clinical director of the Kettering Sleep Disorders Center in Kettering, Ohio.
And many -- like Nytol, Simply Sleep, SomÂ­inex, and Unisom -- contain antihistamines (similar to the allergy medicine Benadryl) that can have side effects like dry mouth and eyes and next-day grogginess, Arand says.
A: If you're taking a short-acting drug, such as Sonata, Rozerem, or Ambien -- and it's still early in the evening -- you can take another pill.
A: It's probably OK, doctors say, but the sleeping pill won't work as well as it should.
This can dangerously slow your heart rate and lead to dizziness, fainting, and shallow breathing, which can deprive your body of oxygen and damage brain cells.
A: Not usually, Arand says, "but some sleep meds can suppress dream recall."
"The newer medications like Ambien C.R., Sonata, Rozerem, and Lunesta have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration without a limit on how long they can be prescribed," Arand says.
Tolerance is a common problem with all sleeping pills: After taking them for a while, you need more than the usual dose to help you sleep, which may lead you to think you're addicted.
Then, stop taking the drug altogether.
A: You might have some trouble, Krieger says, though it's less likely with the newer pills -- these include Rozerem, Sonata, and Lunesta.
A: Yes, but don't expect miracles.
That said, if you want to try melatonin, take 0.2 to 1 mg about four hours before bedtime: "It's safe to take every day," Krieger says.
