1890 is also the year Carmelo Flores Laura was born, or at least, that's what his family and the Bolivian government claim.
The Bolivian man, who lives in the town of Frasquia, in the arid highlands of Bolivia, showed CNN government documents that seem to confirm he's 123 years old.
"He's not the real thing.
He was not born in the year 1890."
The document is a baptismal certificate.
Not only does he walk on his own, but his voice is still commanding.
"I was born here in the highlands," Flores told CNN in Aymara, with his son translating into Spanish.
We never fought.
Coles said it's the genes.
"I constantly congratulate my father," he said.
In fact, the government of Bolivia plans to honor Flores by declaring him "a living heritage" of the Bolivian people.
