Many rivers in the southwest, closer to Texas, where flooding has been prominent, are still rising and expected to crest over the weekend.
Authorities in Franklin, near the Gulf of Mexico, evacuated 118 people after 7 inches of rain washed over some roads and bridges, the weather service said on its website.
Rivers to Louisiana's southeast, near Mississippi, have also gone over flood stage, but inundation has not been dramatic there.
Both have the same root cause, said CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri.
Cold weather should return soon, giving the country a normal start into 2013, he said.
