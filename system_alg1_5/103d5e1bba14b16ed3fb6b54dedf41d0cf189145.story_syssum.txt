(CNN) -- CNN has been singled out for criticism for our coverage of events in Tibet through an anti-CNN.com Web site and elsewhere.
The picture gallery included in Tibet stories includes the image.
Additionally, we have published video from the Chinese media apparently showing Tibetans attacking Chinese interests in Lhasa.
CNN's reputation is based on reporting global news accurately and impartially, while our coverage through the use of words, images or video always reflects a wide range of opinions and points of view on every story.
