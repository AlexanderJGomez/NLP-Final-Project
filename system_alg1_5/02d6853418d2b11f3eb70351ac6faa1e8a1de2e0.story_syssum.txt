Raffaele Sollecito's memoir, "Honor Bound: My Journey to Hell and Back with Amanda Knox," is the first book written by anyone directly involved in the Meredith Kercher murder trial in Perugia, Italy.
Sollecito's book draws heavily on diaries he kept and letters he wrote to friends, family and his hometown newspaper during his years in prison, the preface says.
Sollecito writes that at times, he was uncomfortable with Knox's "bizarre behavior," which he says prosecutors used against both of them.
"When I first found out about what Amanda had signed her name to, I was furious," he writes.
They were intent on getting Sollecito to abandon Knox and accuse her of the murder, he wrote.
Sollecito's lead attorney, Giulia Bongiorno, a prominent parliamentarian, almost walked off the case because of the backroom deal.
"They had one overriding reason to arrest me, throw me into solitary confinement, and threaten me with life imprisonment, and that was to pressure me into rolling over and testifying against Amanda."
In the epilogue, Sollecito recounts how he went to visit Knox in Seattle last fall, but how he was nervous to see her.
Knox's book is due to be released in the spring.
