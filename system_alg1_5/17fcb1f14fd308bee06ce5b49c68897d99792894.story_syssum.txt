The flight attendant who served the offending macadamia nuts testified that she and the chief flight attendant knelt before Heather Cho, the former vice president at Korean Air, and the daughter of the airline's chairman in apology.
Cho Yang-ho, her father and Korean Air chairman apologized to the flight attendants and the public for the incident.
Kim, the flight attendant who initially served the offending nuts, said that Cho wasn't initially angry, but ordered her to bring over a service manual.
Before the plane could take flight, Cho ordered Park to get off the plane, Kim said.
"One of the managers said everyone in this ministry from Korean Air, they are all related to us, don't worry, do what we tell you to do," she said.
