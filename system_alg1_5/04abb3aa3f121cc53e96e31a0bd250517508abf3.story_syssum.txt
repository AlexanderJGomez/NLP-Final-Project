I know.
This is what we do in times of struggle.
Pure and simple, it was a heartless act.
It was cruel.
It gets worse.
And here's the kicker.
Ask any worker at Starbucks, Cosi, McDonald's or Walmart, "How many jobs do you have?"
I know colleagues who've had breakfast at one store, and gone to lunch in another, only to find the same person waiting on them.
Yes.
But there is a way to gain favor.
Rep. Jackie Speier, D-California, tried to shame her colleagues into cutting less from the food stamp program (called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP).
They dine at lavish restaurants, eating steak, vodka and even caviar."
They went after the poor, the unemployed, the single mom, the single dad, the grandparents -- all those people who are trying to make it work.
We're lacing up our shoes, too, but we're going to fight these merciless cuts with the golden rule.
It's time and our might will make this right.
