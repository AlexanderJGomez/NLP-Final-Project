Spain won the last clash between the two teams in July on the way to winning the World Cup in South Africa, ending Portugal's 19-match unbeaten run.
It was only Portugal's second win in nine meetings with Spain, who have not won in Lisbon since 1934.
France, who also beat England in Capello's second match in charge, have now won four successive matches under coach Blanc -- who suffered two defeats after taking over from Raymond Domenech following Les Bleus' first-round World Cup exit.
Russia, who also hope to host the 2018 World Cup, lost 2-0 at home to Belgium as highly-rated young striker Romelu Lukaku scored both goals in Voronezh.
