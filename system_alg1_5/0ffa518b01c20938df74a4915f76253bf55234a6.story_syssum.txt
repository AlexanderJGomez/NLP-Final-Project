"I will end my athletic career and formally retire from the game of basketball," Yao Ming, who turns 31 in September, told a packed press conference in his hometown.
"Nine years ago, I came to Houston as a young, tall, skinny player," he said.
At the press event, amid high praises from sports officials, Yao fielded the rapid-fire questions from journalists -- ranging from his most memorable game to his daughter's first "Daddy" -- with his usual brevity and dry humor.
Now the owner of his former club, Shanghai Sharks, Yao depicted a busy post-retirement schedule filled with work involving coaching, charity and commerce (too busy to help improve the Netherlands' national team, as suggested by a Dutch reporter).
To his admirers, however, Yao's multifaceted role as a sport star, national idol and cultural ambassador simply makes him invaluable.
"It's always taking some legacy from older players -- you get it, you gain experience from that and make your own success."
