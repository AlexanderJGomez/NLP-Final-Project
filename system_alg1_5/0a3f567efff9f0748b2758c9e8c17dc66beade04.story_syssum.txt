(CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Rahm Emanuel will bring a "tough-minded" and "pragmatic" approach to the White House when he becomes President-elect Barack Obama's chief of staff, according to people who know the Chicago, Illinois, native.
In the job, Emanuel would oversee the White House staff.
"That's ridiculous.
It is Emanuel's combination of experiences -- plus his strong personal relationship with Obama -- that would make him a strong chief of staff, said CNN political analyst Paul Begala, a fellow Clinton veteran.
"But, maybe most importantly, he's got the relationship.
And most importantly, what I want to do as a parent," Emanuel said in an interview that aired Wednesday.
Emanuel's at-times blunt approach would ensure the White House runs smoothly for the new president, said Mack McLarty, Clinton's former chief of staff.
He's direct.
"He's dangerous," Cole told Fortune then.
... Barack Obama can be the good guy," Gergen said.
"I love Rahm, but that's a small group of us," he told Fortune.
