Obama said Wednesday that he had "reached out" to French President Francois Hollande and pledged to offer "every bit of assistance" to help France, a country he praised as "America's oldest ally."
Johnson said while "this was very definitely a very sophisticated, precise and lethal operation," it was still unclear what motivated the attackers.
"No country knows better than France, that freedom has a price because France gave birth to democracy itself."
France is a member of the U.S.-led coalition that has carried out attacks against ISIS, and Earnest said that the U.S. is "keenly aware" of the "risk associated with that."
"DHS will not hesitate to adjust our security posture, as appropriate, to protect the American people," the official said.
For now, officials have found "nothing that matches."
"Our major concern is to quickly identify the individuals involved," in the attack the official said.
"Obviously, we have questions about the judgment of publishing something like this.
"Now it has to be said, and I'll say it again, that no matter how offensive something like this is, it is not in any way justification for violence," Carney said at the same briefing.
Sen. Joe Manchin (D-West Virginia) called the attack a "horrific situation" and said the U.S. needs to be "very vigilant" on MSNBC.
"My heart goes out to the victims & their families," he wrote.
"Even though it's in France, it's an attack on us," Graham said.
