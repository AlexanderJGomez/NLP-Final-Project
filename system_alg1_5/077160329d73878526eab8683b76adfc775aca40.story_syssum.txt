In theory, nothing, yet in practice, it seldom works out well.
Carrie, the rapturous and terrifying 1976 Brian De Palma thriller based on Stephen King's first novel, is a movie that has earned its place as a quirky horror milestone without, perhaps, ever having quite attained the status of a masterpiece.
And De Palma, a prankish virtuoso, perched the whole thing on the knife's edge between sincerity and satire.
Kimberly Peirce, the gifted director of the new Carrie, has gone down what seems, on the surface, to be a savvy road.
Moore makes her fierce, guilt-tripping, and scary â€” but not, in the way that Laurie did, almost religiously possessed.
Here's the problem, though.
She's now a cute, bright, painfully shy girl who sees herself (wrongly) as a loser.
It's all about Carrie's revenge, once she's subjected to the most diabolical practical ''joke'' in movie history.
Sure, a lot of famous movies are timeless, yet they're also rooted in their time.
