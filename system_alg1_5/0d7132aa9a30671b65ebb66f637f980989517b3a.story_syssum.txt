At the same time, contradictory statements made in Tehran make it clear that the Iranian authorities are divided about the implications of the American military's return to Iraq.
Still, overall, Iran and the US are clearly going in the same direction in Iraq, at least while the fight against ISIS rages on.
Mohammad Sadr, a deputy to Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, told an Iranian newspaper "Iranian-American cooperation against [IS] is possible and achievable."
Politically, it is already happening.
Since Monday's developments in Baghdad and the nomination of a new premier by Iraq's President Fouad Massmoum, Iran's reaction has been one of approval of the turn of events.
Tehran desperately wants to keep Iraq intact as a nation state.
If true, this goes to show the depth of Iranian anxieties about the "Islamic State's" rise in Iraq.
And, they readily admit that the neutralization of ISIS needs an American military involvement.
But all the recent trends suggest that the moderate viewpoint in Tehran has the upper hand on the policy question of Iraq and how Iran can best serve its interests.
