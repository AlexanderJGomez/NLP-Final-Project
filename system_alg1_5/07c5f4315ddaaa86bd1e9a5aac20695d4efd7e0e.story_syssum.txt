Kang, who was vice principal at Ansan's Danwon High School, was rescued from the sinking Sewol ferry.
No one spoke.
"As the one in charge of the safety of the students, he was suffering from guilty feelings," another teacher had told Korean media.
Police have confirmed the contents of a note, which Kang left behind.
In Korean funerals, there are no ceremonies or eulogies -- they are a quiet, private affair.
Dressed in their school uniforms, they bowed to the family.
Another student, Kim Hyun Soo, also a freshman, said she felt it was too harsh for Kang to be blamed for what happened on the ferry.
"The vice principal really liked students," she said.
The day before the funeral procession, his family declined to be interviewed.
The hearse carrying his coffin traveled a few miles east and pulled into Danwon High School, circling the campus for one last time -- signifying Kang's last visit to his school.
