"Let me shake a few more hands," Clinton said, a comment reminiscent of refrains made by Iowa- or New Hampshire-bound politicians.
"This is a very well orchestrated roll out that is going to make the book have far more impact and, yes, will add to her sense of candidacy," said David Gergen, a senior political analyst with CNN who has deep connections with the Clintons.
In addition to helping Clinton, the hypothetical candidate, Gergen said the book rollout will help her staff.
Her rhetoric, too, has started to sound more like a campaign.
The Clinton team brought on Tommy Vietor, a National Security Council spokesman during Obama's first term, to coordinate and assist in the response to the book and questions about Clinton's record at the State Department.
The meeting was tightly controlled by Clinton's advisers, who told attendees that there would be no leaking what was discussed in the briefing.
As her aides have been planning and preparing, Clinton has been all over the news.
Along the way, locations for Clinton's book tour were released: New York City, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and San Francisco, to name a few.
And as is evident with Clinton's stepped up presence and the slow trickle of news about her campaign, Clinton's book tour appears to be as much a memoir roll out as it is political tune up.
