SAE was founded March 9, 1856, at the University of Alabama, five years before the American Civil War, according to the fraternity website.
SAE has had to work hard to change recently after a string of member deaths, many blamed on the hazing of new recruits, SAE national President Bradley Cohen wrote in a message on the fraternity's website.
"The media has labeled us as the 'nation's deadliest fraternity,' " Cohen said.
Universities have turned down SAE's attempts to open new chapters, and the fraternity had to close 12 in 18 months over hazing incidents.
