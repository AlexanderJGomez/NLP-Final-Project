"Since we're attacking, there is no sense to have peace talks now," Aleksandr Zakharchenko, leader of the self-proclaimed People's Republic of Donetsk, said in a meeting with university students, according to his media office.
"There will be no attempts from our side to talk about the ceasefire," he said, reported Russian state news agency RIA.
"We need to get our guys who've been captured," he said, according to RIA.
On Wednesday, for instance, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said that "more than 9,000 Russian troops (crossed) our Russian-Ukrainian border, bring with them hundreds and hundreds of tanks, armed personnel carriers, and killing Ukrainian civilians and attacking Ukrainian troops."
"As to the flow of troops and armaments, this is not the first time we hear something like that," he said.
Weeks later, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula.
Then in April, violence broke out in two Ukrainian regions that border Russia -- Donetsk and Luhansk -- as separatist leaders declared independence from the government in Kiev.
