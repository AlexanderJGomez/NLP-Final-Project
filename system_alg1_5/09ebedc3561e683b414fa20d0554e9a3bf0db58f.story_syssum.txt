(CNN) -- Sinkholes, like the kind that swallowed part of a resort near Disney World in central Florida this week, are more common than you might think.
Sinkholes are particularly common in Florida, which rests on a nearly unbroken bed of limestone, according to the Florida Sinkhole Research Institute.
Other places that frequently see sinkholes include Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee and Pennsylvania, the U.S. Geological Survey says.
For instance, in 2012, a 15-year-old girl died when her family's car fell into a Utah sinkhole, according to media accounts.
