The protests, which were expected to continue Tuesday, have hurt the economy.
The protesters, who are trying to bring down the prime minister's administration, announced the blood drive an hour after Abhisit ignored a demand by the "red shirts" -- named for their clothing -- to dissolve parliament by noon Monday.
The next day, they will collect 1,000 more liters and target the prime minister's residence, the demonstrators said.
Two soldiers were hurt, the colonel said.
Since Thaksin's ouster, Thailand has endured widespread political unrest that has pitted Thaksin loyalists against Abhisit supporters.
