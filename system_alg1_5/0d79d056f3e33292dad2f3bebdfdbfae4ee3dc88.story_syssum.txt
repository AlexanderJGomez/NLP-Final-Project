"The mainstream TV and film representation at Comic-Con has outstripped the original essence of the convention," said iReporter Brad Powers who attended Comic-Con the past two years, mainly for the panels on "Lost."
"I don't even try anymore," she said."
"It's too crowded, too commercial, and, oh yea, it sells out before you even know who's gonna be there," she said.
Erin O'Donoghue, a hardcore fan of "Chuck," is one of those who disagrees.
"Last year, at one of the studio panels, they had the Mike Judge film, 'Extract,' and people saw the footage.
It also brings in other people to the convention that otherwise wouldn't be interested," she said.
This year, those fans can breathe a sigh of relief, since the cast of "The Twilight Saga" won't be there -- this year.
