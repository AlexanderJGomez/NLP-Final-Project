Some lava is flowing, and the volcano is spewing a cloud of steam and ash that has risen as high as 28,000 feet, said Schneider, at the observatory in Anchorage.
Veniaminof, about 60 miles from Pavlof, started showing activity in early June and began erupting June 13, Schneider said.
"So far there's been trace amounts of ash, so it's just a fine coating," he said.
"Our best estimate of what is going to happen is similar to what's happened in the past -- this level of activity and some level of ash."
