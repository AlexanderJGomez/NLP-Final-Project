Hamas security sources reported at least 60 Israeli airstrikes across Gaza on Monday night into Tuesday, including from F-16s, Apache helicopters and drones.
Last week they were focused on de-escalation, but now Israel is preparing for a possible deterioration of the situation, he said.
At least 15 people were injured, he said.
Israeli police have questioned six suspects about what they did "before and during the murder" of the Palestinian teen who was abducted and burned to death, Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
Naftali Schwartzburger, the lawyer of one of the six suspects, said on CNN affiliate Israeli Channel 2 on Monday that Israeli police conducted re-enactments of the killing of  Mohammed Abu Khedair.
We delivered.
We've done exactly that," said Mark Regev, spokesman for Netanyahu.
Shelly Dadon, 19, was kidnapped and stabbed to death by an Arab Israeli taxi driver, who has now provided details of the killing, according to Rosenfeld.
Meanwhile, the Abu Khedair family is irate over the treatment by Israeli police of one of the burning victim's cousins, an American high school student.
"We're extremely concerned that he's under house arrest right now without really facing any legitimate charges that have been made public, and that those who beat him apparently are walking free," his family attorney said Monday, speaking from Florida.
They were masked.
"They are investigating whether he was throwing rocks," another senior State Department official said.
Regev, Netanyahu's spokesman, agreed.
"If they sentence them and demolish their houses and give them life sentences, it might satisfy me a little," Suha Abu Khedair said.
Officials from both sides have called for restraint amid fears that the cycle of horrific violence could continue.
