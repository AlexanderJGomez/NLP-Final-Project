"Take a bow, Mrs. C," White tweeted.
But the photo was not, it turns out, from Marie Claire, as White acknowledged.
The irony here, of course, is that White took ownership of an objectified version of Crawford's body in exactly the same way she set out to criticize others of doing.
To be sure, there is some comfort to be found in that photo.
After all, what we like here is that Cindy, in fact, doesn't look all that amazing, and to say she does resonates as more than a little condescending.
We don't like Crawford's image because it's "real."
Which, of course, could not be more unattractive.
