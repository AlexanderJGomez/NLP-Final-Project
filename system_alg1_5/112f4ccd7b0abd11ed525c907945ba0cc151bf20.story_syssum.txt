HAMILTON, Bermuda (CNN) -- The Obama administration's agreement with Bermuda to settle four Uyghurs from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was causing a rift Friday between the United States and its strongest ally, Britain.
A U.S. official, on background, said the British feel blindsided.
Bermuda "should have consulted the UK government," he said.
With the Uyghurs already in Bermuda without travel documents, the UK is helping the Bermudian government carry out a security assessment, he said.
The men, who are staying in an apartment, were free to roam about the island.
He said Bermuda, a British colony, told the UK of its intentions, but not until late in the process.
The 17 Uyghurs had left China and made their way to Afghanistan, where they settled in a camp with other Uyghurs opposed to the Chinese government, the Justice Department said in its statement.
They left China because they did not agree with the government, she said.
The Chinese statement followed an offer by Palau, a Pacific island nation, to accept Uyghur detainees.
China has said no returned Uyghurs would be tortured.
