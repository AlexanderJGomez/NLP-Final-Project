If it is al-Baghdadi, it would be one of the first known appearances of the militant leader to be captured on video.
In the video, the man purported to be al-Baghdadi urges people to follow his call to create a "caliphate," an Islamic state, in Iraq and Syria, and wage "jihad" during Ramadan -- the holy month of fasting for Muslims that began last week.
Al-Baghdadi's appearance comes days after ISIS declared him as the leader of its new "caliphate," or Islamic state, extending from Aleppo in northeastern Syria to the Diyala province in Iraq.
"It was a terrifying Friday," she said.
"The emir of the believers, he will give the sermon," said one of the men who arrived with al-Baghdadi.

Al-Baghdadi was detained for four years in Camp Bucca, which was a U.S.-run prison in southern Iraq.
