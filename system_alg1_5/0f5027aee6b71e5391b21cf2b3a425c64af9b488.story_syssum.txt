(CNN) -- Despite the excitement over the royal tour of New Zealand and Australia, the commonly held view of politicians in both countries appears to be that the writing is on the wall for the reach of Britain's monarchy to its far-flung South Pacific realms.
There are differences between Australia and New Zealand, however.
For a start, Australia was more Irish.
Historically New Zealand was the more loyal dominion, and more economically dependent until Britain joined the EEC, a move that did not help monarchism.
The status of the Treaty of Waitangi, signed in 1840, is central in the New Zealand case, whereby the chiefs ceded government to the Queen of England in return for her protection.
The remainder of the New Zealand honors system, however, had to wait until 1996.
Jim Bolger, the then National (non-Labour) prime minister, is a republican, and his stance prompted the creation of a Monarchist League of New Zealand.
Australia differed from New Zealand in holding a referendum on becoming a republic in 1999, despite the prime minister's monarchism and a divided Liberal Party.
As for baby Prince George, support for his position as future heir to the thrones of Australia and New Zealand may be dictated in part by the sustainability of his -- and his parents' -- celebrity status.
