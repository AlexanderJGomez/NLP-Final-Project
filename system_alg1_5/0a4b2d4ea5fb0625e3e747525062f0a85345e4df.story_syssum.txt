Popular belief was that if a government failed to deliver on Carnival, Haiti's equivalent of Mardi Gras, it was sure to fall, said Marie Laurence Lassegue, Haiti's minister of culture and information.
"This is the first time Carnival is not happening," said Roberto Martino, lead singer of popular Kompa band T-Vice.
"I don't think we have time to think of Carnival," Lassegue said.
"Maybe when we are finished crying."
Now I have four sheets," she said.
"We don't know how many days, how many months, how long we will be this way," she said.
Nearby, the 44 members of Relax Band, who normally would be revving up their street performances in the days before Carnival, worried about their next meal.
"It is one of the greatest tragedies to befall our country," Beauvais said, pointing to the rubble of his house.
"If you have a good showing at Carnival, you're set for the rest of the year," Martino said.
"People are saying Haiti is finished, but no, no, no, we will rise up,'' he sang softly.
"Don't be discouraged.
"We're all so traumatized," he said.
Carnival was part of us."
