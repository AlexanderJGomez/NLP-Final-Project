The search was concentrated to the west of Brisbane, near Toowoomba, which was all but submerged when a wall of water tore through the town on Monday.
Some 200 people, including members of the Australian Defence Force, Special Emergency Services and police, searched vast tracts of land and swollen waters for 55 people still missing.

So far, 70 towns and cities in Queensland have been affected by the flood, Bligh said.

"We've been coming back and forward just to check" on the hostel, Jackson said.
