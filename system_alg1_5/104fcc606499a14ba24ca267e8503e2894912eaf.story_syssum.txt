They also took into account how many, if any, existing antibiotics still work on the bacteria.
Most patients who get this potentially deadly infection are on antibiotics for other infections.
The problem is that while antibiotics kill bad bugs, they also kill good bacteria in your gastrointestinal system that help fight off bad bacteria, C-Diff included.
You can also do your part, the CDC said, by preventing infections in the first place.
Also, lowering the use of antibiotics in animals to only when it's absolutely necessary can contribute to stretching the life and usefulness of available drugs, Frieden said.
