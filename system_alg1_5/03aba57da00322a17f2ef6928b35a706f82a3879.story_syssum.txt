(CNN) -- The great Davos talking shop is now up and running, with delegates of all levels of importance, shapes and nationalities zeroing in on this quaint, alpine town to put the world to rights.
For a delegate arriving from New York this week flying business class, the price comes in at between $4,200 and $5,300.
A visitor from Tokyo can expect to pay between $7,200 and $10,500, while a delegate flying in from Johannesburg, South Africa will pay around $4,150.
It's cold in Davos, very cold.
Thermal underwear, winter jackets and snow boots are a must, particularly when the temperature plummets in the evenings as you make your way to the various cocktail parties, meals and social events hosted by partner companies.
$40,000-per head well spent.
