Ever since October 1, when Healthcare.gov went live, I've tried to go on the site and enroll.
When I tried to make a new account, that didn't work either.
"The system is down at the moment," read the message on the screen.
I've covered health care reform for 25 years, first as a print reporter in Washington and then for CNN.
These people needed insurance, plain and simple.
But when the big day rolled around, after years of waiting, for many their hopes were dashed as they couldn't enroll on the site.
Healthcare.gov's glitches, on the other hand, are so overwhelming that Ezra Klein of The Washington Post's Wonkblog has deemed it a "failure," at least so far.
There is, however, a light at the end of the tunnel.
The third time, however, I was successful.
They fixed the problems though, and the program is now generally considered a success.
I hope to get no more error messages, no advice to try again later, and goodness knows, no twirly things.
