Historically, the role has gone to cardinals, however.
Tagle would normally be considered too young for the role, but Benedict XVI's almost unprecedented resignation might have changed the way the cardinals think, he said.
Since Monday, the gathered cardinals have been holding meetings, known as general congregations, to discuss the most serious questions facing the church.
No date has been set for the conclave, or secret election, for the new pope, said the Rev.
The cardinals have to have all the information they need in order to make a mature, responsible judgment in the election, especially at a time when the church faces complex issues, he said.
"We'll continue briefings, but without cardinals, to help U.S. media especially cover this exciting moment in the church," Walsh added.
All the cardinals, including those older than 80, are entitled to take part in the closed-door general congregations.
The cardinals could continue their meetings on Saturday, Lombardi added, but are unlikely to meet Sunday when Mass may be held.
"They want to say what the next pope will hear, because he's probably in that room, and they also want to alert the people who haven't spent so much time in Rome just what the situation really is here as they see it," Cardinal Francis George of Chicago said.
They, too, have no interest in seeing it drag on, and there is no reason to believe that it will.
