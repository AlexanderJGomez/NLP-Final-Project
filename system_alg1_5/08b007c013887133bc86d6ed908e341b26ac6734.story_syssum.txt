(CNN) -- Before middle-aged men started singing "Viva Viagra" in TV ads, before former Sen. Bob Dole appeared in its commercials in the '90s, before the blue pill with a funny name entered the public lexicon, impotence was hush-hush.
"It's like the nuclear explosion," said Dr. Irwin Goldstein, director of Sexual Medicine at Alvarado Hospital in San Diego, California.
"It is one of the revolutionary steps in sexual health," said Dr. Ira Sharlip, spokesman for the American Urological Association.
"People who couldn't enjoy intimacy before have been given a second life...." he said.
"Along with the birth control pill in the '60s, this pill really changed people, society and medicine," Goldstein said.
"I've never run across men singing about their impotency," he said.
The man's penis is like "the tip of the iceberg" or "the canary in the mines," which serve as an indicator of overall health, Morgentaler said.
For others, it has revitalized and strained marriages.
"Sometimes their spouse personalizes it," said Melchiode.
Even when Viagra is effective, some men realize that it's not the magic bullet that solves their problems with intimacy, doctors said.
"One has to think beyond just giving a pill to cure sexual problems," Melchiode said.
Sex, it turns out, is part of a bigger web of relationship issues.
