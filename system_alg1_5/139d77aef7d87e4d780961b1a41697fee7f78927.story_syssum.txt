"I'm here; this is my answer," Chavez told reporters at the presidential palace, raising his arms and gesturing at his body.
The Nuevo Herald, citing two unidentified sources who said they were witnesses, reported Thursday that Chavez had been taken to a military hospital on Tuesday because of kidney complications.
"I'm going to start practicing baseball or softball, both things," he said.
"I am my own answer," he said.
"It's normal now, but it could be lower," he said.
"The body was protecting itself," he said.
And responding to media reports that he is dying, he said, "Here I am."
It's morbid, obscene, inhumane.
Even if it didn't, " he said.
Last week, a representative for Penn confirmed a report that Penn had flown to Venezuela months ago to speak about the hikers' plight with Chavez.
