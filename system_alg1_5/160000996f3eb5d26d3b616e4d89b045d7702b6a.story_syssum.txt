Under California's new top-two primary system, the top two candidates in the first round will advance to the general election, regardless of their party.
Steyer and Harris would be among the most formidable contenders for Boxer's seat, along with former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who has said he is "seriously considering" a run.
Steyer, a former hedge fund manager from San Francisco whose net worth has been estimated at $1.6 billion by Forbes, has pledged to give away the bulk of his fortune to public interest and philanthropic causes during his lifetime.
"From my first days as a prosecutor in Alameda County, to my work as San Francisco District Attorney to my current service as California Attorney General, I have worked to bring smart, innovative and effective approaches to fighting crime, fighting for consumers and fighting for equal rights for all," Harris said in a statement on her new campaign web page Tuesday.
And I will fight relentlessly to protect our coast, our immigrant communities and our seniors."
Speculation had swirled around the possibility of a heated race between Harris, 50, and Newsom, 47, who could have potentially split the Northern California vote, clearing the way for a Southern California candidate like Villaraigosa.
Therefore I will not seek election to the U.S. Senate in 2016," Newsom said.
