As friend Jake Fogelnest puts it, "While (the "Jersey Shore" cast) is out fist-pumping, Liz is in her dorm room watching Netflix."
The fact that a show like that is on now is amazing and great," said Fogelnest, who hosted his own show on MTV as a teenager (from his bedroom, no less), "Squirt TV," in the mid-1990s.
For the record, Lee told CNN, "The people, the places, they're all real.
Benjamin Nugent, author of "American Nerd," noted, "When you have people choosing to be nerds, questions of authenticity can come up.
In fact, even though MTV means "Jersey Shore," "Teen Mom" or "The Real World" to most, it has had its moments over the years of standing up for nerds ("Squirt TV" among them).
The network's best known example of a nerd -- a fellow nerd girl, no less -- is "Daria," the animated spinoff of "Beavis and Butt-Head," which started in 1997 and lasted for five seasons.
"Daria made it cool to be a smart chick," said writer Jennifer Vineyard, who worked at MTV for eight years.
"He was completely real," said Curry.
'Hey, it's OK to be a nerd, you can be famous.
Then there's the show that introduced "Beavis and Butt-Head" to the world, "Liquid Television," an anthology of experimental animation that aired in the 1990s that appealed to animation buffs.
Two other memorable shows that were launched off the success of "Beavis and Butt-Head" in the 1990s were "Aeon Flux" and "The Maxx," both series with tremendous appeal among hardcore comic book and animation fans.
"I love that I can go on the subway, and people are reading 'The Walking Dead.'"
"(MTV was) able to take fan culture and market a show specifically to it," said Nugent.
