While official state media has given cursory coverage to the trial, Chinese netizens fed an online frenzy of commentary about the case, which was the top trending topic Thursday on Sina.com's Weibo, a Chinese Twitter-like microblogging site.
Once heir apparent for a place at the top of China's political elite, Bo is on trial on charges of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power.
"All of a sudden, in my view, Bo Xilai has decided not to co-operate, but not completely.
Instead, they talked a bunch of issues that don't really have much to do with the accusations," wrote Yuxin.
Still, many supporters on Weibo applauded Bo's tenure as mayor of Chongqing, where he made his name as an anti-graft crusader.
"I never care about politics but I think it's worth following right now because of Bo Xilai, but I can tell the result has been scripted, now is only a process to make people think that our country is fair and transparent," wrote Xiao Kui Kui-Cindy.
