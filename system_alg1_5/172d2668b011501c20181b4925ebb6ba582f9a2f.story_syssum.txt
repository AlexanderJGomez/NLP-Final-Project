"We have decided to restore flights by Russian strategic aviation on a permanent basis," Putin told reporters after inspecting joint military exercises with China and four Central Asian states in Russia's Ural mountains.
"Militaries around the world engage in a variety of activities, so this is not entirely surprising," he said.
Putin said that when Russia had cut its flights in 1992, other military powers had not reciprocated.
During the Cold War, Russian long-range bombers, which can carry strategic nuclear weapons, played elaborate games of cat-and-mouse with Western air forces.
