Then the men lost to the Canadians in the semifinals Friday, ending hopes of a first men's hockey gold since the famous Miracle on Ice in Lake Placid 34 years ago.
"The way we played the last two games we didn't deserve (a medal)," U.S. captain Zach Parise told NHL.com.
"We let our country down, that's it."
There was also disappointment for the U.S. in arguably Saturday's biggest event, the men's slalom, on the penultimate day of the Olympics as Ted Ligety couldn't complete the second run.
"Most impressive day in my career," Matt told reporters.
"Not all the best guys had the chance to make it down, unfortunately, but it is what it is," Ligety told the U.S. ski team's website.
If this was Marit Bjoergen's last Olympics, she went out on a high.
"Four years is a long time, and I'm not getting younger," Bjoergen told reporters.
I would have moved on.
Probably not.
