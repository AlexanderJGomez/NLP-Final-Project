Michael Brewer, who suffered burns over 65 percent of his body, will have his own skin transplanted onto the burned areas of his back and buttocks, said Lorraine Nelson, a spokeswoman at the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center.
Gordon Weekes, Bent's attorney, denounced the fact that the teens were charged as adults.
"But they can treat them as adults in court, when we have very capable remedies for them in the juvenile justice system, which is geared towards rehabilitation," Weekes added.
Authorities say that Mendez admitted setting Brewer on fire, and that he made a "bad decision," according to an arrest transcript.
"They still have to perform several operations on him for skin grafting, but his parents are with him all the time," Nelson said.
"I don't tell him what happened," Brewer's mother, Valerie, told CNN affiliate WFOR-TV.
When Brewer did not pay, police say, Bent stole Brewer's father's bicycle.
I don't focus on it," Brewer's father, also named Michael, told WFOR.
"I can describe both of them as being afraid, being fearful," said Michael Brannon, a forensic psychologist, without identifying the boys.
"It's a horrible event that occurred, but this was not their conceptualization, in my opinion, of what was going to happen."
