Israel used a Patriot anti-aircraft missile to bring it down, the IDF said.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based activist group, said the Syrian fighter jet was targeting the countryside around the Syrian town of Quneitra, where the only border crossing between Israel and Syria is located.
"As the civil war rages in Syria, IDF forces have experienced combat in the region, both from targeted strikes and errant fire," it said.
