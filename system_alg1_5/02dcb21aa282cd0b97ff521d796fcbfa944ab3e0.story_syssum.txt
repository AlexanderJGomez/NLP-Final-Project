"Most partnering and advising will now be at the battalion level and above," White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters Tuesday.
"In response to an increased threat situation as a result of the 'Innocence of Muslims' video, plus the recent insider attacks, ISAF forces are increasing their vigilance and carefully reviewing all activities and interactions with the local population," Maj. Lori Hodge, a spokeswoman for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, said earlier Tuesday.
"The circumstances in which we have reduced our partnership operations are not ideal by any means at all, they are not what we would have wanted," he said.
"This will likely lead to adjustments in exactly how, when and where ISAF troops operate, especially during the current period of heightened tension," she said.
Hammond echoed Carney's statement from the White House, saying "partnering and advising" would take place at the battalion level and above.
"This is an approach that the Taliban is resorting to, similar to the use of (improvised explosive devices)," Panetta said.
It's unclear what impact, if any, the earlier suspension in training and the temporary halt of some joint operations will have on the timetable to withdraw.
"It's less about the precision of 25 versus 10 than it is acknowledging that the Taliban are seeking ultimately to have some impact in the formation," Allen said.
