Standing outside her home in Orange Park, Florida, Thompson looked into the camera and, with her voice cracking, sent out a stern warning to her daughter's killer.
You took her from my family, you took her from all these people.
The body of her daughter, 7-year-old Somer Thompson, was found in a south Georgia landfill, Clay County, Florida, Sheriff Rick Beseler said Thursday morning.
Police have no suspects, she said.
The sister said she brought up the fight while she and her brother walked Somer home from school, and that Somer ran off from them, apparently upset.
The medical examiner in Savannah, Georgia, used dental records to positively identify the body as Somer's, said Clay County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Mary Justino.
Thompson, he said, was devastated.
"There is a child killer on the loose," the sheriff said.
