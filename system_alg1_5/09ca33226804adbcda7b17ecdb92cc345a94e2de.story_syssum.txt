Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora died in the terror attack, saw al-Megrahi a week ago in Libya, he said Tuesday.
"He can walk a few steps," Swire said of al-Megrahi.
But al-Megrahi's death could change the legal playing field, Swire speculated.
"If he were to die, the the situation would change," and Swire might be able to get the case reopened, he said.
"A mass murderer tasted freedom, experiencing joy," Menendez said.
"Al-Megrahi ... is very much free, living in the lap of luxury by all accounts," Menendez said.
A special Scottish court in the Netherlands convicted al-Megrahi in 2001.
