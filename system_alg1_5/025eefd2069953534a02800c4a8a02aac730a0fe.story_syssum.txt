Earlier this week, the city's Department of Public Health announced that 706 infants and 43 health care workers had been exposed to tuberculosis, commonly called TB, at Providence Memorial Hospital.
As of Monday, more than 350 appointments had been made for screenings, according to the health department.
The infected health care worker is no longer working and is receiving treatment, the owner of the hospital, Sierra Providence Health Network, said in a statement.
The Texas Department of State Health Services conducted an on-site investigation at Providence Memorial Hospital last week and cited the hospital "for deficiencies that represent immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety," said Carrie Williams, the department's director of media relations.
"This is one of the largest TB exposure investigations we've ever been involved in, and it involves infants, so it is particularly sensitive," Williams said.
Without treatment, TB can be fatal, the Mayo Clinic says.
