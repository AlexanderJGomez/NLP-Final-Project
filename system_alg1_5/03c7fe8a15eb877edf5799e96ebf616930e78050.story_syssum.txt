"The president has ordered his release, and we are hoping he will be released very soon," Wilson Ajuwaand said, referring to his client, Henry Okah.
"We support Henry Okah's decision to accept any deal that will ensure his early release to attend to his failing health under the current circumstances," said Jomo Gbomo, a MEND spokesman.
Okah's release had been a key demand of MEND before they accept any government amnesty offer.
After receiving news of Okah's acceptance of the government officer, MEND issued a statement.
