The property, called the "Elvis Ranch" by locals, is just east of Highway 301 in Horn Lake, about 17 miles south of Memphis, Tennessee.
Presley purchased it in February 1967, three months before he married Priscilla Beaulieu, according to a Graceland spokeswoman.
"I got a call one day that Priscilla was coming up for a visit," he said.
"There's still a trailer pad behind the Honeymoon Cottage," McLemore said.
He was a quiet owner, she said, and the ranch is prime real estate.
