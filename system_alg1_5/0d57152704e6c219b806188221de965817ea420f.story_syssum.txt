(CNN) -- Following the shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, in November 2009, the attempted car bomb in Times Square in May and a number of other domestic cases, including the recent arrest of a Somali-American teenager in Portland, Oregon, U.S. security agencies are sharply focused on the potential "radicalization" of American-Muslims and how to prevent it.
Second, it seeks to profile individuals suspected of drifting toward "radicalization," that is, the adoption of extremist ideas.
And in a liberal society, where ideas themselves cannot easily be criminalized, something like Prevent is a viable and necessary alternative, they argue.
In addition, sponsoring moderates to promote the government's anti-extremist message meant, in practice, funding religious scholars and imams to advance an official interpretation of Islam.
More generally, the government's search for moderate Muslims often seemed like a search for Muslims who agreed with it, which meant that "moderate" Muslims were quite hard to find.
After all, in the majority of cases since 9/11, including the recent Oregon arrest, the original intelligence has come from Muslim communities.
If, on the other hand, they launch ideological campaigns against a minority among their own citizens, they inevitably conjure memories of the last century's witch hunts of communists and black nationalists.
