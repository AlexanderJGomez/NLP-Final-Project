It wasn't until famed oceanographer Jacques Cousteau's 1956 documentary, "The Silent World," that people began to see what the world under the sea was really like.
Cousteau "invited people to explore along with him, and so for us it's the same thing," said Lang.
But the biggest difference between the OpenROV and the one, say, James Cameron uses, is the price.
That's not something that I get to do,' " Lang said, "I think that's what we're trying to instill back in everyone."
"We set a goal for $20,000 and ended up raising that in about two hours, which is really exciting," Lang said.
"It's fun to watch the kind of dollar amounts go up, but then you quickly realize, 'Oh my God, we have to build all these things.'
"We have people from well over 50 countries in our community who can all contribute to how to make the design better and how to use it better," Stackpole said.
"OpenROV is an open-source community," Stackpole said.
"For us, we want to innovate as quickly as possible.
And our answer certainly is, 'both,' " Stackpole said.
