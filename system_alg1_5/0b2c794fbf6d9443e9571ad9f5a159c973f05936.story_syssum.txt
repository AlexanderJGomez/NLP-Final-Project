"I was amazed by the beauty of the fishing boats, many of which were old, damaged by the salt and the sun or abandoned," remembers Llonch, who was at the time cycling solo around the West African country.
"It's like a reincarnation of something that had life before -- a life in the Atlantic, a life in Africa," says Llonch.
Artlantique's eclectic creations are then shipped to Barcelona, Llonch's base, and from there they are sent to clients across Europe, as well as stores in New York and Tokyo.
"The main reason of this project is to preserve the wood as it was, with all the stories, all the nautical miles sailed in Atlantic," says Llonch.
"Africa for me is a social inspiration, it's my passion," he says.
