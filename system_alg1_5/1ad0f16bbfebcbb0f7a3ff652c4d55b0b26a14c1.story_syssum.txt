Then, most recently, a cadaver dog picking up the scent of human remains in a basement near Etan's home.
Each time, the result has been the same: sometimes a few answers, often more questions, and rarely anything resembling the full truth for Etan's parents, Stan and Julie Patz.

Three years later, in 1982, the roller-coaster would start its climb again with reports that a man, Juan Antonio Ramos, had swiped a boy's book bag and tried to lure him and another boy into the drainage tunnel where he was living.
The case didn't pan out, at least initially, and Ramos vanished.
Three years later, in 1991, after helping secure another conviction against Ramos, federal authorities visited the Patz family again.
They never have.
In 2001, Stan Patz had his son declared legally dead, and in 2004, a judge found Ramos liable for Etan's death in a wrongful death civil lawsuit.
