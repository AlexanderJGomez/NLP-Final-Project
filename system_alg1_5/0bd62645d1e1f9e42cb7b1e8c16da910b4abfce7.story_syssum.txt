Merah, a French citizen of Algerian descent, had been put under surveillance after trips to Afghanistan and Pakistan, officials have said, leading commentators to ask why he was not stopped sooner.
Aicha claimed that Merah had beaten up her daughter, 19 at the time, and held her son, 15, against his will in a room for several hours, forcing him to watch videos of violent combat and of people's throats being slit.
But, he said, "there was no single element" that would have allowed the police to arrest Merah before the killings began.
The first floor balcony from which Merah jumped, still firing, before being shot in the head, has been boarded up.
Fillon said the French domestic intelligence service, the DCRI, had done its job "perfectly well, it identified Mohammed Merah when he traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan, it questioned him and it monitored him, he was under surveillance, on a list, and it was thanks to that listing that he was identified.
Rival candidate Francois Hollande, appearing at a rally Thursday night, said questions will have to be asked about the Merah case, French media reported.
Merah then jumped out a window onto a balcony, still shooting, and was found dead on the ground, officials said.
After Merah was killed, police found video he had recorded of the attacks, ammunition and ingredients for explosives, Molins said.
He had "already committed certain infractions, some with violence," Gueant said.
In the first shooting on March 11, Imad Ibn Ziaten, a paratrooper of North African origin, arranged to meet a man in Toulouse who wanted to buy a scooter Ziaten had advertised online, the interior minister said.
The other victim, the daughter of the school's director, was killed in front of her father.
