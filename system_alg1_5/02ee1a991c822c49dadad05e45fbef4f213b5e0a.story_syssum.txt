An aerial endeavor that would take 17-year-old pilot Haris Suleman and his father, Babar, around the world in just 30 days and into the record books.
His body has been recovered, she said.
He was doing something adventurous," she said of her brother, who received his pilot's license in June.
"In all these endeavors, the biggest part of the whole thing is the planning," he said.
"Haris' adventurous spirit and huge heart led him to reaching for this personal goal while also seeking to raise funds and awareness for schools supported by The Citizens Foundation, a nonprofit organization headquartered in Karachi, Pakistan," said Melvin Siefert, principal of Plainfield High School.
The oldest sibling, a brother, was trying to get from London to American Samoa to pick up Haris' body but there were only a few flights, Hiba Suleman said.
He and Haris were wearing "gumby" suits that could help them survive a water landing, Hiba Suleman said.
The plane has yet to be recovered, but emergency beacons were sending out signals.
