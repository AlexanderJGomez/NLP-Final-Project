Specifically, Congress hasn't passed a budget in almost four years.
It's called "No Budget, No Pay," and it means what it says.
This is your money.
To be clear, this is just kicking the can, but it's still a responsible step in the right direction.
"No Budget, No Pay" was originally proposed by No Labels, a group of Democrats, Republicans and independents dedicated to the politics of problem-solving.
"No Budget, No Pay" is a no-brainer.
Not incidentally, that's also the reason "No Budget, No Pay" does not violate the 27th Amendment, which forbids salary increases or reductions during a current Congress: Their salary is not being reduced, it is being withheld until they actually do their job.
It will not solve all our problems, but at least by imposing a degree of personal accountability on members of Congress, it might encourage constructive cooperation instead of last-minute scrambles and hyperpartisan brinksmanship.
If patriotic conscience can't compel Congress to work together, maybe requiring them to have some personal skin in the game will inspire them to do their job.
