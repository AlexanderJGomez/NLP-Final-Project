The December gang-rape and murder of a young woman in New Delhi has stirred consciences in India in a way I have never before experienced: It has forced Indians to confront a terrible truth that for our girls and women, violence and discrimination are facts of daily life, an epidemic that, researchers say, claims nearly 2 million lives in India each year.
But along the way, I've also met countless men who, given an opportunity, were willing to examine and improve their behavior towards the girls and women in their lives.
When prompted to reflect on their attitudes towards women's education, sharing domestic tasks, having girl children, and even violence, the boys and men I work with every day can and do change.
"Let the other men laugh at me for cooking and washing clothes," he told me.
But each time he folds the linens, Ram shows his children he respects his wife and treats her as an equal, not someone subservient.
This was all necessary.
We have a long way to go, and not just in India.
We can change.
