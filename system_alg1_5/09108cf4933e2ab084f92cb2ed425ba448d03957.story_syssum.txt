The Vatican verified his first miracle, the curing of a French nun of Parkinson's, from which he also suffered, just two months after his death.
John XXIII's canonization, however, was not on the radar, but it makes sense.
(Early Italian reports suggest December 8, a Sunday this year, and the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, as the most likely date.)
Pope John Paul II, in fact, oversaw the canonization of more people (483) than had been canonized in the previous 500 years, in part to lend the weight of Vatican authority to saints that had emerged throughout the global Catholic world.
For example, Pope Celestine V may have become a saint, but he was recognized for his quiet life as a hermit, rather than for his brief life as pope (he was also an inspiration for Pope Benedict XIV's retirement).
John XXIII, however, is something of a hero to more liberal groups because of his sponsorship of Vatican II.
