Jason Segel and Paul Rudd star in "I Love You, Man," which opens Friday.
"It was not part of the lexicon while we were filming," added Rudd.
"That's what he does," Rudd noted.
In "I Love You, Man," Segel's character is rougher and looser than his characters in "Sarah Marshall" and "How I Met Your Mother."
"It's filled with puppets," he said.
"I think we both had something to learn from each other," he said.
"Yeah, and my character had to learn that maybe it's time to grow up a little bit," Segel added.
"That's us in a nutshell, not macho, not tough," he said.
"Just less fart jokes."
