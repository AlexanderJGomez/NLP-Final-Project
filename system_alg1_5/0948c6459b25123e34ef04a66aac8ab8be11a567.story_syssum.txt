The transformation of our neighborhood over the past decade has been inspiring, if comparatively unheralded.
Destruction is easy.
And too often, the daily work of rebuilding does not get its due.
But it is the main event, evidence of how we honor the past while moving on with life.
Most of all, it is the result of hard work.
Yes, there have been mistakes and missteps along the way.
Where others have destroyed, we will build.
