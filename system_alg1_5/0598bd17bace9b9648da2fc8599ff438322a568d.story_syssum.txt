(CNN) -- "A fashion show's soundtrack is just as important as the venue, the seating and the production," said Alexander Wang, the 29-year-old designer of his own label.
But Kors, who compares fashion shows to Broadway productions, said it is the music that brings it all to life.
The collection, which Kors calls "urban athleticism," focused on movement and speed, and was enhanced by Moon's soundtrack.
The special will also include interviews with Sarah Jessica Parker, Drew Barrymore, Diane von Furstenberg and Michael Kors.
