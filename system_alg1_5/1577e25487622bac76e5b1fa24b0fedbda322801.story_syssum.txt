A man stabbed nine people, including the driver of a bus and passengers on Wednesday, in what police are calling a terror attack.
He was arrested and is being questioned, they said.
"Hamzeh has no political affiliation," the uncle said.
When asked what could be a motive for the suspect's attack, the uncle said it was "because of what he sees of suffering of the Palestinians by Israel.
The uncle said his nephew, born in late 1992, was age 22, not 23 as authorities reported.
Five people were either lightly or moderately injured, emergency services said.
A Hamas spokesman, Izzat al-Risheq, who is based in Qatar, praised the attack, according to the Times of Israel and Haaretz.
This same terrorism is trying to attack us in Paris, Brussels and everywhere."
And, it said, in light of the bus attack, U.S. government employees are prohibited from using public buses throughout Israel and the West Bank.
-- More than a week earlier, attackers stabbed one Israeli soldier to death in Tel Aviv and three more Israelis near a West Bank settlement, the IDF said.
-- In October, a Palestinian man rammed his car into commuters waiting at a light rail stop in Jerusalem, killing a baby and wounding several other people, Israeli police said.
