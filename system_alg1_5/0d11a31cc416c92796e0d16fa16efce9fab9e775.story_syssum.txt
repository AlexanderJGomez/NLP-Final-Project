Hurley "finagled entry" into the birthday party that West threw for his girlfriend, although only "several dozen people" were invited, the lawsuit said.
"Immediately after giving his word to honor the condition required for his attendance at the event," Hurley posted the shaky video on MixBit, a video sharing website owned by his San Mateo, California, company, it said.
"An opportunity to do so appeared to Hurley when he learned of the October 21, 2013, event featuring West and Kardashian," it said.
Hurley knows better, the lawsuit said.
