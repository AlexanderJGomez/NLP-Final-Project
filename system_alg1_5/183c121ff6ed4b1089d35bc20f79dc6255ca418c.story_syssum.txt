According to a statement from the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the bomb was placed in a stolen taxi which had been hijacked late Sunday in North Belfast.
"Clearly the people responsible for this showed absolutely no regard for human life," said local police commander, Chief Superintendent Nigel Grimshaw.
"The people responsible for this cowardly attack refuse to accept that Northern Ireland is moving on and that peace is working here.
About 3,000 people died in the "Troubles," as the violence was known, before the tenuous peace agreement was hammered out.
