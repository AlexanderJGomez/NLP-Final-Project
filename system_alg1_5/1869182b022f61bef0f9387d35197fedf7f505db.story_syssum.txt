Yet, an estimated 4,000 people call this place home, a stretch known as "El Bordo," or "the border," wedged along the U.S.-Mexico border.
There is no way in hell I am staying here," Miranda said.
Miranda was born in Mexico, and 25 years ago he illegally immigrated to the United States, the country where he worked and prospered, where his children were born, educated and given better opportunities.
Most of those deported have no connection to Tijuana, no family or friends, and some can barely speak the language.
His mother and father came in illegally, but as an adult, Valdez got a green card, a four-year college degree and a job as a computer programmer.
"It just feels the gate itself is so far away, even if I'm standing right next to it," Valdez said, staring at the border separating him from the United States.
"See, it's pretty strong," Miranda said as he jumped on it.
After having lived in the United States for 25 years, Miranda had a home, a job and, most important, a family: a wife and four children, all American citizens.
The police constantly harass them for no reason, he says.
I don't like it at all," Miranda said.
Mexico doesn't want you, and the U.S. sure as hell doesn't want you," said Hector Barajas, an activist and deportee who lives in a shelter outside Tijuana and advocates for those living in El Bordo.
"They look at you as a criminal, a drug addict and stuff like that," Barajas said.
You haven't shaved.
And he doesn't need to.
"My home is in L.A.," he proudly proclaimed.
I have no place to go.
There's absolutely no discussion about what to do about the deportees, from either U.S. or Mexican authorities.
The situation here is no good."
