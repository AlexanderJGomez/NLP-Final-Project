Not so many years before that photo was snapped, the three of them were inseparable -- not only on a basketball court, but in the minds of hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, of admirers.
It almost never is, whether you are friends as famous as they were, or as anonymous as most of the rest of us are.
In 1960, the three had been teammates on The Ohio State University basketball team that won the national collegiate championship.
They were separate people, but they were one.
The friends, because of circumstance, have parted.
Fifty winters ago -- the winter that Lucas and Havlicek and Siegfried and their Ohio State teammates won their national championship -- I somehow, as a junior high school student who wasn't even that good at math, talked the local television play-by-play man, Jimmy Crum, into letting me sit with him and help with the statistics.
Most of us, if we are lucky enough when we are young to have friends whom we treasure, tend to lose track of some of them over time.
They ended up as a part of each other.
We may go our separate ways, for a while.
The friendships are home.
