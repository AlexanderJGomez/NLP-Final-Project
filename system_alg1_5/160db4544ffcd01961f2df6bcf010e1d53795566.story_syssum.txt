"It looked like a perfectly smooth landing, nothing out of the ordinary," said Lou Romansky, who was stuck in traffic and saw the plane go down.
"I saw an airplane landing in the middle of the water, but very calm," she said.
"Immediately there were ferries on the scene," said Harrington.
Police boats and helicopters arrived shortly after, he said.
"[The rescue] looked pretty well-organized from what I could see," said Jim Davidson, who lives two blocks from the Hudson River.
...There seems to be even more emergency crews in the water and hovering above than an hour ago," he said.
"A few minutes [after the crash] it started sinking in the water," said Echevarria.
"They must have gotten a rope around the plane at some point, because they were turning it around and dragging it towards New Jersey," she wrote in an email.
"I really thought it was a terrorist attack," said Romansky.
"It was surreal to see that happen," he said.
