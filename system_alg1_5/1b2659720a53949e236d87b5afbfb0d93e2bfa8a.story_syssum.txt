This bailout was a terrible idea.
Here's why.
The industry was happy to oblige, given the implicit promise of federal backing, and subprime lending soared.
In contrast, a bailout transfers enormous wealth from taxpayers to those who knowingly engaged in risky subprime lending.
Thus, the bailout encourages companies to take large, imprudent risks and count on getting bailed out by government.
The costs of the bailout, moreover, are almost certainly being understated.
The bailout has more problems.
This means, at a general level, abandoning the goal of home ownership independent of ability to pay.
That someone should not be, and does not need to be, the U.S. taxpayer.
