Months later, Ruiz and her family received another surprise, courtesy of ABC's "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition."
"When Ty Pennington came to our home and said, 'Ruiz family, come on out,' we all just ran out and couldn't believe that we were chosen," Ruiz said.
In order to devote their time to the Juarez community, the family put construction of their own home on hold in 1996, Ruiz said, leaving many parts unfinished.
"For us, it is a new beginning, and it's going to change our lives," Ruiz said.
"That's the whole point here," Pennington said.
For Ruiz, it's about teaching young minds so they can in turn give back to their community.
The Ruiz family episode of "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is scheduled to air March 15.
