Southwest Airlines, for one, has decided to do something about it.
Southwest dubbed the initiative "Luv Seat: Repurpose with Purpose," and reached out to potential partners to take the used leather, but found that there were few takers.
It's actually much harder than you think it would be," says McInnis.
The leather is finite, but the skills these young people will learn will hopefully take them through their lives," says McInnis.
The material is also lighter, reducing the weight of each aircraft by 600 pounds, and saving on fuel.
There is, however, an ecological incentive.
says Sophie Virapin, Air France's vice president of sustainable development.
"This is a new area for us, and with the leather, we're just dipping our toe in the water," explains McInnis.
