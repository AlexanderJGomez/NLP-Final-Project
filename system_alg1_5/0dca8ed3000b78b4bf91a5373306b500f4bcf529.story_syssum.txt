A little girl, no taller than the weeds that surround her, stands in a field and picks petals from a delicate daisy.
"No one had attacked anyone like that before," said Robert Mann, a Louisiana State University professor who literally wrote the book about the Daisy ad.
It aired only once, during an NBC broadcast of the film "David and Bathsheba," as part of the network's popular "Monday Night at the Movies."
But the advertising giant responsible for the Johnson ad, Doyle Dane Bernbach, understood what made people buy things -- and ideas.
"It was almost like a crusade not to have Goldwater become president," said Sidney Myers, the creative director at Dane Doyle Bernbach at the time who helped make the ad.
"It was a commercial that went viral before there was a 'viral,' " said Drew Babb, an advertising creative director who teaches political ads at American University.
"We decided that would be a great symbol to use," he recalled.
"And so when it aired, I remembered them saying 'Oh my gosh.
" she said.
"But, you know, it's part of my life and part of my history."
