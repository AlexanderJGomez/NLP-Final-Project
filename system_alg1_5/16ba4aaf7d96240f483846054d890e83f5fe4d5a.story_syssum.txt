These requests might be for personal information found in iTunes, Game Center and iCloud accounts.
Apple received 3,542 of these "device information" requests in the U.S. for 8,605 devices, and Apple turned over some or all of the desired information 88 of the time.
Though the information in the reports is somewhat standard, Apple did included something different.
"Six months from now, we will look to make sure that line is included, and if they don't say they have not received a 215 request, we can assume they have," said Cardozo.
"We have reported all the information we are legally allowed to share, and Apple will continue to advocate for greater transparency about the requests we receive," Apple said in the report.
We have no interest in amassing personal information about our customers," Apple said in the beginning of the report.
