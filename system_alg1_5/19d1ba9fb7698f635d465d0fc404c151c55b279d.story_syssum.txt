The time has come for all to accept that terrorists cannot be treated as criminals.
By and large, the criminal law approach is retrospective rather than prospective.
Nor should terrorists be treated as soldiers, a dignified profession and calling.
As such, terrorists are not without any rights.
Or terrorists may be kept at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, or shipped to countries that do not abide by our rules or maybe only to those that do.
It is time to settle the matter and tell the government lawyers to move on.
