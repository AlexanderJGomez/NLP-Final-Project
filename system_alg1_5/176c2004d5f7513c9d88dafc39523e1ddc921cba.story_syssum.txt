Described as the "Netflix of Africa," Njoku's company has today grown to have more than 500,000 registered users.
Jason Njoku: When we started the company, iROKO Partners, we were trying to solve the massive, I would say, dislocation in the popularity of Nollywood and the value it's created.
We've spent a lot of money -- in the industry, licenses, organizing our team, we've got a staff of 100 people -- so our view is that some additional value needs to ... be given to this new subscription service we're rolling out, (called) iROKOtv+.
I guess, ultimately, the big market is Nigeria...this is where the content originates from.
We are really young, as ambitious as we want to be.
JN: Nigeria has been growing -- I think it's in the top 10, but, again, just to put it in context, I believe we have more people watching just in London than we do have in the whole of Nigeria.
Internet adoption has definitely exploded in Nigeria and we feel it's better -- again, we're trying to serve very data-intensive, bandwidth hogging files, so we're always going to be slower on the uptake but it is improving.
Whereas my friends went into banking, consulting, finance, I just wanted to be an entrepreneur, to work in projects which really interested me.
Then I had to drive her around to go and see my aunts and uncles who I hadn't seen in a long time -- it was exactly the same thing for these guys and I was like 'well, how can it be that so quickly so many people's viewing, video and entertainment habits change.'
Before, they were losing out to the pirates, now they are gaining financially from iROKOtv.
