By critics' reckonings, Pixar has never released a bad film, and those who saw "Up," its 10th feature, say the studio's perfect record is still intact.
"It's a terrific family adventure," wrote Peter Bradshaw of Britain's The Guardian.
However, it turns out he's not alone.
"Up," on the other hand, received little but cheers.
"But really the reason 'Up' is opening the festival is not because it's animated, not because it's 3-D, it's ... because it's a wonderful film.
"The Pixar films, the Hayao Miyazaki films from Japan, the Wallace and Gromit films from Britain -- we're really living in the golden age of animation, one of the great ages of animation in the whole history of film," he said.
