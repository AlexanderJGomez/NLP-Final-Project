(CNN) -- As oil began approaching the coast of the United States, environmental scientists said the effects of the spill in the Gulf of Mexico could have ecological and biological consequences for years, if not decades.
About 1.6 million gallons of oil have spilled since the explosion, the Coast Guard said.
He said there have been some oil spills in Europe that provide clues as to what might happen.
"This event is a self-feeding fire," Charter said.
Ultimately, this will have a multidecade impact."
The residual oil was not nearly as toxic as the oil studied in the days after the spill.
All the scientists CNN spoke to said that the long-term impacts of the spill depend on how much oil reaches the coast.
"Eventually that water moves out into the Caribbean and the Atlantic," he said, indicating the East Coast needs to pay attention to where the oil is traveling.
