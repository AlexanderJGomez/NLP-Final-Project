Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's re-election campaign released its June fundraising numbers Monday, reporting that it raised $71 million to Republican opponent Mitt Romney's approximately $100 million.
As we did with Romney's contributions, here's what the president could get for his $71 million.
At approximately $2,200 per pet, Bo, the first dog, could take on 32,272 purebred, hypoallergenic friends.
8 million pounds of arugula.
The compound, which includes two full-sized homes, a par-3 golf hole and equestrian facilities, was listed in August for $23.7 million.
At $6.49 per six-pack, the cost of one of Obama's favorite beers is approximately $1.08.
The first couple could spring for the $10,000 to bring that many couples with them on a five-day holiday to the president's home state.
