Mohamed al-Magariaf, the head of Libya's General National Congress, said around 50 people have been arrested, though another senior government official said the number was not that high.
"Definitely it was planned by foreigners, by people who entered the country a few months ago, and they were planning this criminal act since their arrival," he said.
In the meantime, FBI agents are interviewing witnesses outside Libya, federal law enforcement officials said.
