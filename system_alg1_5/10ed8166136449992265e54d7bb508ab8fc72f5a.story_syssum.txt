But across the channel there is one Briton at the forefront of his sport who, through a series of peerless performances, is in line to become the UK's first Tour de France winner.
"It is Bradley Wiggins' Tour de France to lose," according to former British cyclist and now commentator Paul Sherwen, who made his debut in the race in 1978.
"There's a long way to go," Sherwen told CNN ahead of Thursday's 10th stage.
Simpson, the victim of heat exhaustion and amphetamines taken to enhance performance, died on the slopes of Mount Ventoux in southern France, during the 12th stage of the 1967 race.
"Up until recently, we had to expatriate ourselves to race professionally," explained Sherwen.
I'm not saying it's easier, but, in English soccer, you've got Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool and you can dream of playing for one of those teams as a kid.
"The perception of Team Sky is very good," said Sherwen.
"If Bradley could win the Tour de France this year it would be absolutely huge," said Sherwen.
