Robert was 15 when his brother, Edwin, left home at age 18.
"It was like a bigfoot sighting," he said.
Robert, 29, is a sergeant in the U.S. Army who lives with his wife outside Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
I was anxious.
I couldn't believe it," Robert said.
When Edwin left his Philadelphia home at 18, he told Robert he was staying with his girlfriend, Tamara, and her family, Robert said.
Edwin was an adult who left home on his own, so the police couldn't intervene.
But as if on cue, Edwin stood up and walked over to the stunned men and said, "Pop," to his father.
Edwin held it inches from his face, almost straining to read it, Robert said.
"He gave me a long hug," Robert said.
Police arrested Linda Ann Weston, 51, Gregory Thomas, 47, Eddie Wright, 49, and Weston's daughter, Jean McIntosh, 32, for allegedly imprisoning four mentally disabled adults in the basement boiler room.
In addition to the four captives found in the basement, authorities have located 10 other potential victims, including six children, Ramsey said.
Edwin is slowly opening up about his ordeal, Robert said.
Edwin told his brother that one of the captives, Herbert Knowles, had seizures in the basement, so he gave him water and placed a cold rag on his head, Robert said.
"The first thing I wanted to tell him was that this was not his fault, that everybody gets tricked," he said.
