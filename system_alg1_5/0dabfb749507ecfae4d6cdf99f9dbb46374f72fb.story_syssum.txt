(CNN) -- DNA has linked the slayings of three women, Philadelphia police said Tuesday night in announcing they are looking for a serial killer.
Previously, DNA from the scene of the two earlier homicides was found to be from a single person, police spokesman Ray Evers said.
"We have detectives working day and night, following every tip," Clark said.
The victims all were choked, police said.
All victims were white females involved in prostitution and narcotics, police said.
