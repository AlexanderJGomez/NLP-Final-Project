It's considered one of the world's largest private real estate development ventures in history, a joint project with South Korea's Posco and Gale International, a U.S. real estate developer.
"Under construction today is about $10 billion" of the project, said Chris Sausser, executive vice president of Gale International.
"We are going to contribute to the global community by action, not talk."
