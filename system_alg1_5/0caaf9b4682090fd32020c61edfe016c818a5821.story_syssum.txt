"It is very disappointing that we have lost our first home match," Van Gaal told BT Sport in his post game interview.
A busy pre-season witnessed promising victories over Liverpool, Roma, Valencia and Real Madrid.
In the second half we never played as a team, therefore I'm responsible," Van Gaal continued.
Like many a visitor to Old Trafford, Swansea sat in deep and attempted to play on the break.
"We have been working hard in pre-season on defensive shape and we can get even better at that but there were pleasing signs in the way we stuck together and the goals we scored against a side of Manchester United's resources," said Swansea manager Gary Monk.
