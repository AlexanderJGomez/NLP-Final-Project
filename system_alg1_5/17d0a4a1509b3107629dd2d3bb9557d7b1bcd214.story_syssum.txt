Over the weekend, women rose up in Nepal, protesting outside the prime minister's house against gender-based violence.
According to Eve Ensler, the head of V-Day and One Billion Rising, a movement calling for women to rise up on February 14, 2013, and demand an end to violence, women in Somalia are planning what may be their first-ever major demonstrations against rape and violence.
This groundswell -- what Ensler calls "a catalytic moment" -- is the perfect chance for us to consider how we think about subjugation, rape, and degradation of women globally.
For women, "peacetime" does not exist.
And, as in India, where the appalling remarks of Andhra Pradesh Congress chief Botsa Satyanarayana appeared to place blame on the Delhi gang-rape victim -- she chose a strange private bus, she shouldn't have been out after dark -- politicians, clergymen, husbands, and others around the world perpetually blame rape survivors.
OK. That's one part of the equation.
Yes, women often do not report sexualized violence.
Let's understand that rape is not a problem that affects only women: It affects families, communities, entire cultures.
The time is now.
