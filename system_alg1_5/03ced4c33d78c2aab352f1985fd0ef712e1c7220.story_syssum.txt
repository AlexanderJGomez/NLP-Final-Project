I wrote songs with him, but it was his trip.
I had no experience whatsoever; I just wrote the first four songs in my life, which were "Bad Motor Scooter," "Make It Last," "One Thing on My Mind," and "I Don't Want It," played them for Ronnie upon first meeting, shook my hand, and said, "Let's start a band."
And he's going, "I don't want to play that kind of music," and I'm going, "Well, I do."
I was talking to a guy a couple of days after the show, and he said, "That's Ronnie Montrose, and that was his last show.
He said, "Come on in.
I played him my four songs, we shook hands, and he said, "Let's start a band.
Like I said, I went from zero to a hundred in the blink of an eye -- all because of Ronnie.
We butted heads and I got thrown out of the band [after one more album, 1974's Paper Money], but I carried on with that "first Ronnie Montrose" I saw.
We were on a stadium show with Boston, Black Sabbath, myself, Van Halen.
He's been thrown out of Montrose."
And that was pretty much Ronnie's style, too.
Montrose, the whole band, has not been there.
And he was in, we were all in.
And Ronnie was in.
Songs can go forever, but we can't.
Rest in peace.
