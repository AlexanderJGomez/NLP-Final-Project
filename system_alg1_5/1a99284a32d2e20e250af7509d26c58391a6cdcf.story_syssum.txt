The Beasties revel in their older-than-old-school references ("Be kind, rewind") and cultural touchstones ("braggadocio" rhymes with "I'll make you sick like a Kenny Rogers Roaster").
Now cheekily retitled "Hot Sauce Committee Part Two," it's their first album in seven years, unless you count 2007's stoner-funk instrumental throwaway, "The Mix-Up."
They get guest shots from Nas ("Too Many Rappers") and Santigold (the reggae detour "Don't Play No Game That I Can't Win").
MCA sounds as gruff as ever in "Nonstop Disco Powerpack," giving it up to hip-hop pioneers like Rammellzee and K-Rob's "Beat Bop," Afrika Bambaataa and Spoonie Gee ("The one MC who you can't deny"), while both the bass line and the distortion-filter vocals echo Spoonie's 1980 classic "Spoonin Rap."
Nobody would want to hear the Beasties try anything else.
