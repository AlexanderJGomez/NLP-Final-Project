Near Suruc, Turkey (CNN) -- Iraqi-Kurdish Peshmerga fighters began arriving in the besieged northern Syrian city of Kobani from Turkey, two witnesses said Thursday, starting what analysts call a largely symbolic reinforcement of fellow Kurds defending the town from ISIS.
The supplies and troops, though roughly an infantry company-sized contingent, would boost Kobani's defenders somewhat, given that they've seen few reinforcements since ISIS' siege of the city began in mid-September.
ISIS is also reinforcing its contingent in Kobani, White said, setting out the prospect of a protracted fight over the city.
With ISIS controlling the Syrian land surrounding Kobani, the Peshmerga's easiest path into the city was through Turkey.
The Syrian Kurdish fighters, part of the People's Protection Units, or YPG, have ties to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which has fought a 30-year guerrilla war against the government of Turkey, where about 20% of the population is Kurdish.
