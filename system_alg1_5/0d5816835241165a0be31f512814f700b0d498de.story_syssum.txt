Washington (CNN) -- Forced federal spending cuts have had a "devastating impact" on judicial operations nationwide, prompting a request to Congress for emergency funds to keep operations going at minimal levels, court officials say.
"All aspects of court operations have been severely curtailed" as a result said Gibbons, a federal appeals court judge in Memphis, who also heads the administrative conference's Budget Committee.
While courts have to deal with cuts, federal prosecutors do not at the moment.
Separately, large numbers of court employees have been furloughed -- amounting to 8,600 court staff days and 12,500 public defender days.
