Part road trip, part code jam, the annual competition plunges participants, known as "buspreneurs," into two days of frantic business development on the open road to the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas.
In fact, the StartupBus itself could be considered a meta startup: Organizers this year are developing an online game, the StartupBus Stock Exchange, in which players become virtual angel investors and invest in the companies as they're built on the buses.
When the buses arrive in Austin, development stops.
This year, 1,200 expressed interest when the StartupBus site launched, 300 were invited to apply, and 160 are actually going.
"I've made at least a few very close friends in the experience," says Huckestein, now one of this year's San Francisco bus conductors, who does double duty as an IT worker during the beat-the-clock coding marathon.
Over the last year, the competition has grown from one bus to six.
"You look like an Android user," said Volly founder and CEO Max Mullen to Ghost Nest founder Reid Evans, who is, in fact, an iPhone user.
