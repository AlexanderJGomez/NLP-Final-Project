In an emotional interview, Behar examines how domestic abuse starts and why it's hard to stop.
Greetings.
Givens: Yes, it does.
Behar.
...  Peoria, El Paso.
He would kick.
And I did what you thought you should do, of course.
Givens: Yes.
And then all of a sudden, OK, let's meet and we'll talk.
Givens: Yes.
Givens: It's been torture.
He shakes.
Givens: Well, I was so numb.
Givens: No.
It's interesting, though.
Givens: Yes.
And, also, love doesn't hurt.
... And if a man hits you once, he will hit you again.
That's 1-800-799-7233.
Greetings, Denise.
And it is.
I'm sure you heard it, Robin: you know, nobody is going to want you.
Givens: Um-hmm.
Givens: She's absolutely right.
Givens: I don't know why that is.
And our society does not take it serious enough ... until, of course, there's a murder or there's a celebrity or something of that nature, which is really sad.
