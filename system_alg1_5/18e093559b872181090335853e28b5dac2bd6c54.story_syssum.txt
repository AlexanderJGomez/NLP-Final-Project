There has been some progress in Guinea.
There have, however, been two deaths reported.
The strategy was announced last week at the end of a two-day summit in Ghana that brought together ministers from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Uganda with health experts, Ebola survivors and WHO representatives.
WHO reports there have been 844 cases, including 518 deaths, in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia as of July 6.
"These are very high-risk practices leading to extensive exposures to Ebola virus in the community," the statement said.
The symptoms, at first, mimic the flu: headache, fever, fatigue.
The good news is that Ebola isn't as easily spread as one might think.
"One, (this is) the first time in West Africa that we have such an outbreak," he said.
"Fear of the virus, and the lack of trust in government, in the health system, is as bad as the actual virus."
