(CNN) -- Liverpool, the 18 time league winner and five-time champion of Europe, was humiliated by third-tier Oldham 3-2 in the FA Cup, the most famous domestic cup competition in world football.
Joe Allen, a $23.6 million signing, volleyed Liverpool back into the contest courtesy of a huge deflection, but Oldham held out for a famous victory.
Oldham, which is managed by former Arsenal and Manchester City striker Paul Dickov, will now face Liverpool's Merseyside rival, Everton.
"The FA Cup was a competition we wanted to have a go at and there is no excuse," he told reporters.
Leeds, which was relegated from the top-flight in 2004, now faces an away game at Premier League champion Manchester City.
Meanwhile, Luton Town, which became the first non-league side to ever beat a Premier League team following the 1-0 win at Norwich on Saturday, will play first-tier Millwall in the next round.
