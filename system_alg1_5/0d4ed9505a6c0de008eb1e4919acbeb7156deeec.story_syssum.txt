In the final round of polling before the elections, Herzog's Zionist Union party is in the lead, holding a four-seat edge over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party.
"I have always suffered from a certain underestimation," Herzog said, "and I have always surprised."
He promised, "I will surprise again, and I will show my leadership and stamina."
Herzog, in a speech almost immediately after Netanyahu's address to Congress, promised to work with the United States and European powers, not against, to ensure the safety of Israel.
Never.
His grandfather, Rabbi Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog, was the first chief rabbi of the state of Israel.
His father, Chaim Herzog, was an Army general, an ambassador to the United Nations and the president of Israel.
