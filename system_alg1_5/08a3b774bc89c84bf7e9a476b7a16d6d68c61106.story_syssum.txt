James McCormick, 57, marketed his ADE 651 units to government agencies and private companies around the world, including in Iraq, with sales exceeding $50 million by his own admission.
While specific cases of death or injury as a result of the use of the devices can't be proved, their sale was a "callous confidence trick," the judge said.
"Soldiers, police forces, border customs officers, hotel security staff and many other users trusted their lives to the overpriced devices sold by you, which were no more than plastic components with a disconnected antenna with a capability of detecting explosives no better than random chance," he said.
McCormick was not responsible for any attacks, his lawyer said, and any number of devices could not protect the people of Iraq.
But it wasn't just a good sales line that allowed McCormick, over a 10-year period, to become wealthy from a fraudulent device.
