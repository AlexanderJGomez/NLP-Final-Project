Sandra Cantu, 8, had been missing almost two weeks before her body was found.
But today she is skipping on the streets of gold, into the arms of a loving God", said Brent Ives, mayor of Tracy.
Melissa Huckaby, 28, a Sunday school teacher who lived in the same mobile home park as Sandra's family, has been charged with murder, kidnapping, the performance of a lewd and lascivious act on a child under 14, and rape by instrument.
Her casket, signed by classmates, was taken to a nearby burial site by a horse-drawn carriage.
