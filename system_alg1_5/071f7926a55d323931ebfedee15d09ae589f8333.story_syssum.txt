There's the Obamacare website fiasco.
If this were a movie, we would be at the part where the hero finds himself surrounded.
Rather, his storyline is being dictated by others.
It was as if Obama had become George Clooney as the captain of the fishing boat in "The Perfect Storm."
He can accept another plotline -- let's say of "Gravity," with Obama as a character like Sandra Bullock's, hit with one harrowing challenge after another.
This may be exciting to watch, but not great for the character, who has no idea what will happen next.
Yes, many districts have been gerrymandered to all but ensure re-election for Republican House members.
Sure, the Republicans will push back -- they will say Obama is behaving like a "king" or "tyrant" and complain about him nightly on Fox News.
Obama is the star of this movie.
