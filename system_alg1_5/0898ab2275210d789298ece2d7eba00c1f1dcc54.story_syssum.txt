With lingering questions about privacy, game trading and selling, and an "always-on" Kinect device, Microsoft has released new details about the new Xbox One console, hoping to address issues that have had some fans in an uproar.
We designed Xbox One so game publishers can enable you to trade in your games at participating retailers," the post reads.
Microsoft uses the same "game publisher can enable" language when talking about trading or giving games to your friends.
At the end of the day, it's those publishers who have the most to lose if games on new consoles like the Xbox One, and Sony's upcoming PlayStation 4, don't have built-in protections that keep them from being resold or shared.
According to another post, while the Xbox One is designed to work best with a constant broadband connection, it is not required.
Also, while the Kinect can indeed read your heart rate, facial expressions and more, none of that data leaves the console without explicit permission.
