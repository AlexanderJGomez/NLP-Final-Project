A second, named as Jade, told the court that she had been subjected to an "unsolicited" sexual act by Strauss-Kahn -- who's commonly known by his initials, DSK -- after going to a party at the Tantra sex club in Belgium.
But my behavior is the same with all women," Strauss-Kahn said.
Jade told the court she had refused to have sex with Strauss-Kahn at the Tantra club, "because it was a butchery."
"Had I been a libertine, he would have asked, this seems obvious," she said, using a term that describes someone who is sexually or morally unrestrained.
Jade later went on a trip to Washington, D.C. as part of a group accompanying Strauss-Kahn, the court heard.
She did not sleep with Strauss-Kahn on that trip, she said.
The court also heard excerpts of testimony given previously by two other sex workers, named as Estelle and Marion, who joined a second trip to Washington with Strauss-Kahn.
The two women had been introduced to Strauss-Kahn as secretaries working for a construction company at which another defendant in the case, businessman David Roquet, was employed.
When asked whether the men of the group knew of their being paid, Helene said, "Even if things weren't told, and considering their status and intelligence, it would have been too good to be true."
In France, prostitution is legal, but pimping is not.
"But I don't consider myself as the organizer of any party whatsoever," he said, adding that he had never asked anyone to organize parties for him.
However, the investigating magistrates did not follow their recommendations.
