After all, along with co-star Fred Armisen, Brownstein -- founding member of riot grrrl cult band Sleater-Kinney and, more recently, Wild Flag -- has made a second career out of portraying a constituent of the kale-eating, craft-beer-drinking, lumberjack-shirt-wearing, jewelry-making crowd on "Portlandia."
"It's about people who like to feel special, who like to believe that this certain thing has been tailor-made just for them, of which I'm definitely guilty too, at times."
"Now I go into stores and see things I want to buy with birds on it, and I can't, because I'm too self-conscious," Brownstein says.
"The other day, I was in a store and saw a cute dress with birds on it and I was like, 'No, I just can't.'"
