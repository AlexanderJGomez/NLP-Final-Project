"In my political life, it was not the first time that I saw this kind of activity by the Lesotho army," Thabane said.
The Prime Minister said that since the Lesotho military was looking for him, he decided "to get out of the way," and fled to an unknown location.
"There is zero tolerance in the Commonwealth of any unconstitutional overthrow of an elected government," he said in a statement.
Jen Psaki, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, said the United States "is deeply concerned by clashes between security forces today in Lesotho."
