A year later, they're in love.
"The first time people meet you, they want to hear the sensational part" of the crash, says Ben, 39.
"No," she said.
Later, when they boarded, he noticed her again, coming down the aisle.
Laura, who didn't notice Ben, thumbed through a Glamour magazine.
At the helm of the Airbus A320 was Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger, a 57-year-old former Air Force fighter jet pilot.
"One lady screamed," Ben recalls.
"Brace for impact," he said.
She decided against it.
She crouched down, prepared for impact.
Ben was a Carolina native, and he also poured his energy into work.
Once, a bird pooped on Laura's shoulder, sending her into tears.
On a beach outing with his family, his raft drifted out from shore and then flipped over.
"Just make it quick so I don't have to suffer," he thought.
While bobbing up and down there, she called her father.
"Dad, this is Laura.
At the door, he looked out and saw water all around.
He wondered what happened to her.
"I was checking you out on the plane," he told her.
"We connected," Laura says.
"We were family," Ben says, "and we didn't want to ruin that aspect of it."
Laura received a white envelope, labeled with a number.
"It put me back in that seat," she says, tears in her eyes.
Her relationship with Ben, she says, is another "positive outcome" from that day.
"Live, laugh, love and dance like tomorrow's not guaranteed."
