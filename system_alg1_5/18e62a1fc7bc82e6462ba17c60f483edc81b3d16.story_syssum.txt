Even jaded teens, like my 13-year-old niece, Erica Fieldman, can't help but be impressed.
Welcome to Antoni Gaudi's unfinished masterpiece, the Sagrada Familia, Barcelona's most famous site and Spain's most visited.
(If you look closely, you'll see Gaudi's face.)
I want to go to the top (you take an elevator, but walk down the stairs), but I think Erica has had enough.
Park Guell garden complex, designed to be a housing development, was Gaudi's largest work in Barcelona.
Barcelona, home to the 1992 Summer Olympics, is a city that appeals to kids (especially teens) and parents.
If you plan to do a lot of touring, get the Barcelona card, which includes free public transportation, museum admissions, restaurant discounts and more.
It's been here for centuries.
The kids will give a thumbs up to Montjuic, one of Barcelona's largest recreation areas, which rises nearly 700 feet above the south side of the city.
It's housed in three spectacular stone mansions in the historic quarter of the city and showcases works from the artist's early years, his Blue Period and early works from Barcelona.
I didn't really see evidence of that, but, after all, we were there at 8:30, early by Barcelona standards.
We are in Barcelona after all.
Paella, of course, is the famous Spanish rice dish that's usually topped with chicken, sausage and shellfish.
Not bad, she says, helping herself to more rice.
A few months later, Erica tells me she's already decided where she wants to go abroad when she's in college -- Barcelona.
