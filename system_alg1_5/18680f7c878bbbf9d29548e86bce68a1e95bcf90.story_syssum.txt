Michael Jackson's mother and children claim AEG Live is liable for the pop icon's death because it hired, retained and supervised Murray, who worked as his personal physician as he prepared for his comeback concerts in 2009.
"That's a lot of money for anyone," Martinez said.
Murray's Las Vegas home, which he bought for $1.6 million, was appraised at barely $1 million in 2009, he said.
After that, Jackson lawyer Brian Panish told the judge that Katherine Jackson, who can stay in court because she is a plaintiff, needed one of her children to sit with her each day.
Randy and Rebbie Jackson attended court Monday, the trial's opening day.
"No, no, this just happened," Murray told him, Senneff said.
"I don't even go there," Senneff said.
"When she heard the news on TV that Michael Jackson had died, she fainted," he said.
"She was just deeply emotional when we took her to the hospital," Senneff said.
