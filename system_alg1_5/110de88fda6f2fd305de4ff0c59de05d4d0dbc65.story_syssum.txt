WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Conservative columnist and former CNN "Crossfire" co-host Robert Novak has died after a yearlong battle with cancer, his family said Tuesday.
"If you were a friend of Bob Novak's, you couldn't have a better friend," Feist said.
For most of that time, he was a co-host of the political debate program "Crossfire."
While staunchly conservative, Novak opposed the invasion and was frequently critical of the Bush administration.
Novak was born to a Jewish family in Joliet, Illinois, on the outskirts of Chicago, but later became a devout Roman Catholic.
"What you saw on television was an ideological guy, a fire-breathing right-wing guy," Carville said.
CNN suspended Novak, who apologized for using the word "bullsh*t" on air, and he resigned at the end of the year.
