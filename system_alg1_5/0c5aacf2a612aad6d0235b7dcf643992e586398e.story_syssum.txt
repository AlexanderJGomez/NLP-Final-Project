Ofcom, the British media regulator that could force Murdoch out of BSkyB, said it was "reading with interest" the report from Parliament.
However, remarks made by some lawmakers after the report was issued on Tuesday were "unjustified and highly partisan," it said.
"Someone took charge of a cover-up, which we were victim to and I regret," he said Thursday at the Leveson Inquiry.

Myler and Crone "gave repeated assurances that there was no evidence that any further News of the World employee, beyond Clive Goodman, had been involved in phone-hacking," the report says.

He said he was "surprised" by the extent of the contact by the employee, Fred Michel, with the British government as it considered a bid by News Corp. to take full ownership of British Sky Broadcasting.
