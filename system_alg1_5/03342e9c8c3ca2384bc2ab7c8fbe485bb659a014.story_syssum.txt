News apps and mobile sites are helpful, but for real-time streaming updates, it's hard to beat Twitter.
One of them, CNN's Rob Marciano, has been tweeting updates from the storm-lashed beaches of Asbury Park, New Jersey.
Among the most active are Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania, Chris Christie of New Jersey (who, in typically blunt fashion, tweeted "Don't Be Stupid, Get Out"), Andrew Cuomo of New York, Jack Markell of Delaware, Dan Malloy of Connecticut and Martin O'Malley of Maryland.
So are local transit services, such as New Jersey Transit (which suspended all service Monday), and Greyhound, the bus line.
But all the major airlines are tweeting updates about delayed or canceled flights.
