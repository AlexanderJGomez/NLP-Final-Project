(CNN) -- "The Normal Heart," written by my friend, the brilliant playwright Larry Kramer, and based on his story during the earliest days of the AIDS epidemic, tells a tale that many of us lived through, and many others did not survive.
I can't help but wonder, if those in power had cared more, if they had done more, perhaps we could have ended this epidemic before it began to circle the globe.
There is still an AIDS crisis -- not only in sub-Saharan Africa, but right here in the America, in your state, in your community.
And, just as in 1985, it is silence, fear and stigma that continue to drive the epidemic.
The characters in "The Normal Heart," living as they did in the 1980s, didn't understand what they or their friends were dying of, and they didn't have treatments to manage the disease.
Today, as ever, silence equals death.
