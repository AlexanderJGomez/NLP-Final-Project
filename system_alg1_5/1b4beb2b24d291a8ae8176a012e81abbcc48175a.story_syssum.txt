Radel spoke to reporters after returning home to Fort Myers, Florida, Wednesday night.
"I will be going into treatment, and I'm going to start with intensive, in-patient treatment," Radel said.
"My wife is my rock, and she has been so supportive through this," he said.
"Your honor, I apologize for what I've done," Radel told Judge Robert Tignor in court Wednesday.
Radel said he is aggressively pursuing that help, with the support of friends and loved ones.

He is a former journalist and TV news anchor, having worked for WINK in Fort Myers, Florida.
"Beyond that, this is between Rep. Radel, his family, and his constituents," Boehner's spokesman said.
