If the music sounds familiar, you may have heard unauthorized, lesser-quality versions circulated by fans for decades -- or similar takes on the several anthology albums released over the years by the Beatles' label, Apple Corps.
Apple Corps did not comment to CNN on the motivation for the release, but the timing of the release and their naming it "The Beatles Bootleg Recordings 1963" suggests the connection.
You'll hear three full takes of "There's a Place," the first song they recorded that fateful day at EMI Studios in Abbey Road, London.
The new release includes the seventh take of "Do You Want to Know a Secret," while the sixth one was released in 1963.
The two tracks of "From Me to You" offer a glimpse of the group's studio demeanor during another Abbey Road session on March 5, 1963.
They stop playing abruptly in the first take, with Martin asking why.
"Thank You Girl," a song written as a tribute to their already dedicated female groupies, is next.
The band seemed to struggle in that March session with "Hold Me Tight," a song they later said they never cared for.
Several versions of their first big hit in England, "Love Me Do," "Taste of Honey" and "She Loves You" are included.
"For the moment the majority of the Beatles fans are in their hometown of Liverpool, and I have a very strong suspicion that it won't be long before they're all over the country," the announcer said as he introduced their performance of "Love Me Do" on the BBC's "Easy Beat" show on January 26, 1963.
