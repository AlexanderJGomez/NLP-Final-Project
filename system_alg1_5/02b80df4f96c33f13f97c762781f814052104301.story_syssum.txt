(CNN) -- Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the man behind the kingdom's committed policy to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has stepped down from his intelligence post, according to the country's official news agency.
"Bandar was extremely hawkish on Iran even before he had this official position," said Dickey.
This new stance, analysts say, could signal a pendulum swing when it comes to Saudi Arabia's policy toward Syria.
A senior administration official told reporters after President Obama's face-to-face meeting with Saudi's King Abdullah that the United States and Saudi Arabia are "very much aligned" despite recent policy differences over Syria and Iran.
