(CNN)Before Ronald Read died last summer, he was, on several occasions, the recipient of another person's generosity.

Though his jobs never yielded large salaries, Read enjoyed investing in the stock market, always putting his money into "dividend producing stocks," Rowell said.
Besides his frugality, Rowell described Read as a quintessential "Vermonter."
"He'd be shocked to have this much exposure," Rowell said.
