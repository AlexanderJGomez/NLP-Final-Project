"I think a lot of Republicans are looking for a new direction," Oklahoma GOP Rep. Jim Bridenstine, one of those saying he'll back another candidate, told CNN.
This group, which includes about a dozen lawmakers, is almost certain to fail.
"This isn't about John Boehner," Bridenstine said.
Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert and Florida Rep. Ted Yoho, who are tea party favorites, announced they would run for the Speaker.
Still, he said he was only confident that those who have publicly announced they opposed Boehner would actually follow through and vote for someone else on the House floor.
"This is a last moment sideshow," Rep Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a Boehner supporter, told CNN.
Indeed, Boehner has laid a groundwork for being re-elected.
South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney, who didn't vote for Boehner in 2013, wouldn't say how he would vote on Tuesday.
Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, the third ranking House GOP leader who is tasked with counting votes, admitted last month he spoke to a white supremacist group in 2002.
White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, asked Monday whether Scalise should stay, took a jab at the GOP, saying who Republicans choose as their elected leaders "says a lot about who the conference is and what their priorities and values are."
As the former chair of a group of influential House conservatives, Scalise is viewed as Boehner's bridge to those on the right, so any effort to push him out could hurt the Speaker at a time he needs to hold conservative support to keep his own job.
North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who is a close personal friend of Boehner's said the Speaker will have to guide House members to concentrate on things that are doable.
