(CNN) -- It's getting difficult, even for a defense attorney, to keep track of the allegations against Bill Cosby.
A demurrer essentially says the complaint is so defective as written, that it should be dismissed His attorneys have also gone on the offensive, asking the court to impose sanctions against the attorneys who filed this lawsuit.
In real court, however, the rules are different.
While limitations periods are arbitrary, the public policy is not: defendants deserve protection of the law too.
Accordingly, some jurisdictions have special rules extending the time to file in cases of childhood sexual abuse.
Cosby's attorneys correctly point out that Huth failed to file the requisite certificates, which exposes the complaint itself to attack.
However, Cosby's lawyers point out she attempted to sell this story to the tabloids more than nine years ago.
Her attorneys filed her Complaint naming Cosby.
Even if Huth amended her complaint, Cosby's name is out there.
But, under the rules of the Superior Court of California, this complaint should be dismissed.
