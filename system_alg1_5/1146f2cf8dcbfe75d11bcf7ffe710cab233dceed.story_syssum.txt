Clinton will speak at an event in Winnipeg, Manitoba sponsored by CIBC, a large bank in Canada, on January 21, 2015, according to this ticket page.
With the addition of these appearances, Clinton has now headlined events in six of Canada's ten provinces (the country also has three territories).
"I do believe that both Canada and the United States can become even richer, more prosperous, but also more environmentally sustainable by having a broad engagement over energy and climate and not focusing everything on this one decision," Clinton said.
But after her visit to Ottawa in October, one headline pointed to the fact that Clinton's visit may be more than that: "Hillary Clinton winning hearts, if not voters, in Ottawa".
