The irritating glare won't, of course, affect the way we navigate our way to London's Heathrow Airport; a complicated and well-engineered computer system using GPS positioning provides information to air traffic controllers.
That was a question facing pilots in airspace over the United Kingdom on Friday, when Shanwick Oceanic, a part of the UK's NAT system of air traffic control, developed a computer glitch.
Departures, however, will be delayed until the situation is rectified or mitigated.
Radar signals don't have the capability of traveling out to the middle of the ocean, so before airplanes enter the North Atlantic track system, from either east or west, a specific speed is assigned along with a specific altitude.
When the current technology system breaks down, the solution is either to increase separation limits or just wait until it is fixed.
The simple answer is, absolutely.
With all that in mind, we are just going to have to suffer through the compromise of inconvenience when the technology breaks down.
