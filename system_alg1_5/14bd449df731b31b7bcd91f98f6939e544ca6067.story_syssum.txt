In the meantime, they said, they were hoping the peace would hold.
"I think people feel now that the only way to push Israel to give concessions is resistance," said Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official, who cited Israel's agreement to Wednesday's cease-fire as vindication of Hamas' struggle.
Israel's military also claimed success, saying on Wednesday that it had destroyed "significant elements" of Hamas' rocket-launching capabilities.
The leader of Islamic Jihad, a party to the truce that was brokered by Egypt and that took effect on Wednesday night, called for more weapons to maintain resistance against Israel.
"The victory of Gaza is a solid truth, not a phenomenon," Haniyeh said.
At least six Israelis were killed, including a soldier who died Thursday of wounds suffered Wednesday just before the cease-fire took hold, the Israel Defense Forces said.
"Ultimately, as the dust settles and guns turn silent, much more will be known about the new regional map -- how it works, who sets the rules, how far different parties will go, whether the obstacles continually encountered in the past can be overcome," the report said.
"This short war has been, as President Obama might put it, a teachable moment," it said.
"You must remember, Hamas, unfortunately, is the enemy of peace," said the spokesman, Mark Regev.
He called for unification to thwart "what the enemy is wanting to do" and passed on greetings from Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority.
Since the cease-fire was declared, three rockets have been launched from Gaza into Israel, the IDF said Thursday.
The cease-fire calls for Israel to halt all acts of aggression on Gaza, including incursions and the targeting of people, according to Egypt's state news agency.
That's what we wanted," he said.
On Friday, Gaza was quiet again.
