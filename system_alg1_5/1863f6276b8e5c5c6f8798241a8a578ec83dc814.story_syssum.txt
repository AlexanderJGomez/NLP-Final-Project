Hottle grew up going to the national parks on family vacations, exploring parks in New Mexico, Colorado and the rest of the Southwest.
"Where I had just come from was so austere," he said.
Hottle is one of many military veterans who have worked for the National Park Service and at Yellowstone, the nation's first national park, established in 1872.
"Nature is what's driving life here," he said.
But they get it when we explain it to them."
Although Yellowstone is open year-round, just one road from Cooke City, Montana, to Mammoth Hot Springs, Wyoming, is plowed in winter.
For a day trip, don't miss: Canyon Village, in the center of the park.
"I think it's the prettiest part of the park," Hottle said.
"The vibrancy of the colors around the spring are created by natural bacteria," Hottle said.
About 55 miles from his home in Mammoth Hot Springs, Wyoming, "it's the most rugged and mountainous part of the park," he said.
"It's where we see the most wildlife," he said.
As the sun was setting, "I sat down on a rock to look at the water, heard a snorting noise and saw a five-point bull elk swim out into the water in front of me," he said.
Before he disappeared into those trees, he looked at me.
"You can drive around for two weeks and not see a bear, and then three show up in my front yard," he said.
"You can start your own traffic jam," he said.
"Female elk with calves can take people out," Hottle said.
"It's just spectacular," he said.
