Sure, teenagers dominated the figure skating podiums at the Sochi, Olympics, but here in the United States and around the world, a growing number of skaters lacing up to compete are well into their 30s, 40s, 50s, and beyond.
"Someone dared me to skate when I was 30," Schwartz said.
"I realized there was no program for adult skating," she said.
"The plan is to qualify, compete, and hopefully win," said Delano, a three-time national champion.
"They come from all over the world, every continent, it is just amazing," said Schwartz, who now chairs the international competition.
"You are never too old to skate," says Schwartz.
"You just keep doing it, because it's wonderful," said Schwartz.
