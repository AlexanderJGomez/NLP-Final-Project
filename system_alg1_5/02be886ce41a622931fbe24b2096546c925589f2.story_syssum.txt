More than one ton of confetti was released at midnight, with personal individual wishes written in more than 25 languages, a tradition from the past three years.
By mixing red, blue, green and white light elements, the ball's lighting system is capable of producing a kaleidoscopic array of 16 million hues and colors, and billions of patterns, the event's website says.
According to New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, this New Year's Eve celebration, like years in the past, is a product of a lot of hard work and planning by many people.
"It is a big complex operation and you know you always breathe a sigh of relief when it's over," Kelly said.
