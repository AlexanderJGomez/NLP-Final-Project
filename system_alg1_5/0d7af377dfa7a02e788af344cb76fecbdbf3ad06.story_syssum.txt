The mother of Brooke Stegall, 5, says opera gave her visually impaired child new confidence.
But today is their last day here, and performing this 20-minute opera is their "thank you" to their families.
"These parents work so hard to make this happen," said Anne McComiskey, director of the program.
"First of all, we are teaching the parents how to teach their child," she said.
"With a newborn, you're teaching them about their body.
"Because this is an opera, they are learning gestures that they wouldn't learn by watching someone else.
"If you have a visual challenge, you want to be safe in the space you're in, because you may not be able to see everything around you.
Her mother, Rhonda, says the opera changed her daughter.
"That is most unusual, for a child that is blind or visually impaired to go right into a typical kindergarten," McComiskey said.
"I am so proud of myself."
