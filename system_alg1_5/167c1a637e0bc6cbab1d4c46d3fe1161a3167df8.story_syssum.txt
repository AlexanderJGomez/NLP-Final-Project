"Here probably I'm a better player, I can do everything -- not like my years in the NBA," Fernandez told CNN's Human to Hero series.
Fernandez moved to the U.S. after the 2008 Olympic final in Beijing, where Spain lost to the Americans, and spent three years with the Portland Trail Blazers.
"I came here to be the leader and win trophies," he announced on his arrival.
The effort was described as "hellacious" by one U.S. sports writer, who had clearly run out of superlatives, while Fernandez singles it out as a career highlight.
The first year was difficult, but basketball is basketball," he added.
"Pau is probably one of the best players in the world, so he's my reference, and I work every year to be better and better," said Fernandez.
With Spain fielding the likes of the Gasol brothers, Pau and Marc, Juan Carlos Navarro and himself, they once again came close to upsetting the all powerful U.S. squad.
I remember a long time ago in the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, no team could compete against the U.S. Dream Team, but now there's a little bit of respect paid by them to the other teams," Fernandez said.
I think we have a good team, a young team with Ricky Rubio, Marc Gasol, Serge Ibaka and myself."
