But UNGA, with its hundreds of diplomats, ministers and heads of state converging on New York every September, is a much different animal from a trip to a world capitol.
As we were escorted down one of the halls, Capricia Penavic Marshall, the department's chief of protocol, was working with her staff to prepare for what was already shaping up to be an marathon of a week.
Every regional office, such as the Bureau of African Affairs, the Bureau of East Asian Affairs, and the Bureau of Near East Affairs, which oversees the Middle East, had taken over a room or two and had staff busy working the phones trying to set up meetings for Clinton while she is in town.
Lunardi's work also extends to the 34th floor of the Waldorf , the floor where Obama and Clinton will hold bilateral meetings with their counterparts this week.
A separate staff works on the 34th floor, preparing the room where Clinton would be meeting with the Japanese and Russian foreign ministers, and the pool of reporters who would shuffle in to ask questions and take pictures of the two shaking hands.
Down the hall in room 24M, members of the press are getting ready for Clinton's "photo-op" with the Japanese foreign minister.
Matt Lee, a veteran State Department reporter, says UNGA week is always a big hassle because of the famous New York City traffic, but it's a good opportunity to see lots of sources and get a better sense of the full diplomatic picture.
It's not breaking news, but reporters fly back down to 24M file the comments for their outlets.
