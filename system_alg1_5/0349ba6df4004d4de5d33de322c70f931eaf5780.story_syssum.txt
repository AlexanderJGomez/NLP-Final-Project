And now -- due in part to the abundance of social media and the intense interest in Spider-Man's alter ego, Peter Parker -- a firestorm has erupted, after Marvel revealed that Parker will die, and the role of Spider-Man will be taken over by his archenemy, Doctor Octopus.
When issue #700 was leaked early, fan reaction -- both positive and negative -- went into overdrive, with a few death threats directed at the issue's writer, Dan Slott.
Dan Slott: When we first met Peter Parker, he was a teenage bespectacled nerd who resented all the other kids.
For all intents and purposes, he was the adult Peter could have become, Spider-Man's dark reflection.
Peter's final, heroic act was giving Doc all the memories and experiences that kept him on the right path.
With that and the fact that the 50th anniversary was approaching, we thought, let's go out with a bang.
Anytime we talk about Spider-Man, it's a big deal.
Anything you do with any of our characters, there's a big vocal fan base, particularly online.

No one has a take of, "It was all right."
Ma."
But in our world, he's beloved.
And going from everything I've seen on social media, I am so up for that challenge!
