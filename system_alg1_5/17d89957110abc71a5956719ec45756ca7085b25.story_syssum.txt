A regular season game was first played in London in 2007 but, for the first time this season, two games were scheduled on the opposite side of the Atlantic.
"It is a sign that the game is growing globally," NFL commissioner Roger Goodell told NFLUK.com earlier this year.
"I love it," Richard from Pittsburgh, who now lives in Hollywood, told CNN.
"This is an investment and we are trying to grow something," Alistair Kirkwood, managing director of NFL UK, told CNN.
"There are multiple challenges," USA Today's NFL writer Tom Pelissero, who was at the game in London, explained to CNN.
"If you put a team in London, I don't think it would be difficult to make a profit.
"The time zones and travel present a serious issue," he told CNN.
"[A London franchise] is a great idea, the NFL would make a ton of money out of it.
"This is a market where we need to be more active and to grow our game."
