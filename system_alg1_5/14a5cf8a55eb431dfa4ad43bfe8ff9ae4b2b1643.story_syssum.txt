Davos, Switzerland (CNN) -- Free trade, transparency and a crackdown on tax cheats will be at the heart of Britain's G8 presidency, Prime Minister David Cameron told the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday as he set out his vision for a more competitive Europe.
Cameron said the European Union and the G8 -- made up of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Britain and the United States -- all face the "looming, insistent question" of how to compete and succeed in the global economic race.
It's necessary for Europe," he said.
Far from being isolationist, Britain is a "very positive player" in the European Union, Cameron added.
"In the end, we all have to prove that we can pay our way in the world, that our credit is good, and all the rest of it.
"Between us, we account for a third of world trade, so if we really got together and liberalized trade between the European Union and the United States of America, we could make both our peoples a lot better off," he said.
"Like everything else in this G8, the ambitions are big, and I make no apology for that," he said.
The referendum should not be held until it's clear how changes made after the crisis in the eurozone works out, he said, but will be held in the first half of the next parliament.
He added, however, "I think the EU does not need unwilling Europeans."
But critics warn he is taking a big gamble.
