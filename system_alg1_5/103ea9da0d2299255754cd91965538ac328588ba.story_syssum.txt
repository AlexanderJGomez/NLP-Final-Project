This week, cellular carriers released details about a trio of upcoming smartphones, all of which run an older version of Google's Android operating system.
The Atrix, an AT&T exclusive, will be available for pre-order starting on February 13.
The second-largest U.S. carrier by subscribers announced the launch date and a $100 price tag, two-year agreement required, for HTC's Inspire 4G.
All three of these new smartphones, strangely, come with a seven-month-old version of Android, called Froyo.
