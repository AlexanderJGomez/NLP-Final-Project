Several veteran shows were among the nominees for best drama series, including "Mad Men" -- which has won this category four years running -- "Boardwalk Empire," "Breaking Bad" and "Game of Thrones."
Thanks to the showings of "Thrones," "Girls," "Empire" and the movie "Game Change," HBO led all networks with 81 nominations.
The show's defenders, on the other hand, applaud Dunham for showing her characters in less-than-flattering lights and observe that "Girls" isn't the first series to take place in a perceived vacuum.
NBC's self-referential sitcom "Community," a critical darling that was the subject of heated controversy when the show's creator, Dan Harmon, was forced out as executive producer in May, got just one nomination, for writing.
"Homeland," about a CIA agent combating terrorism and her own demons, received plenty of attention, picking up nine nominations, including nods for best drama series and stars Claire Danes and Damian Lewis.
(Her comedy series, "Hot in Cleveland," also got recognition, with two nominations.)
The nominations were announced by Kerry Washington, star of ABC's "Scandal," and late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.
The show will air on ABC from Los Angeles' Nokia Theatre.
