Women, their voices amplified by social media and with the support of a small but growing cohort of men, have been exposing and shaming venerable American institutions such as the NFL, Ivy League and non-Ivy League colleges, and the entertainment icon Bill Cosby.
This year, emboldened and connected by social media, college women formed a powerful grassroots movement that led to universities such as Harvard being publicly named and shamed for not addressing women's rape reports.
These young women had been silent until social media enabled them to come together, even though thousands of miles apart, share debilitating secrets and then act with the confidence that safety in numbers provided.
Barbara Bowman, a Phoenix artist and mother who was one of Cosby's early accusers, told me that being a rape victim "is the most shameful, scary, intimidating, filthy place to live.
"But I have, several times as a child, been punched/stomped/kicked/bum-rushed while walking home from school, and thus lost my body.
The worst part for me was not the experience, but the humiliation of being unable to protect my body, which is all I am, from predators."
And it was terribly important to fit in, to be one of the guys, to fly under the radar as women.
