It's a question I often get asked, and in this interview I think people will, for the first time, get a real sense of his character.
William was the one who, outside the hospital, fixed his son's car seat in, then drove home for the first time with his new family.
As a result, this heir to the throne has been given a rare insight into what it's like to be ordinary, and we're able to connect with him.
In fact before I knew it, the cameras were rolling and the interview was under way.
It worked.
It could be any new dad, and that's what I like about the interview.
