An emergency loan is great, but it's still borrowed money, and as a farmer, that's not good because you have to pay it back."
Last year, the USDA designated 2,245 counties in 39 states, or 71 percent of the United States, as disaster areas due to drought.
"I think, unfortunately, 2012 really may well be the new normal," said Daniel Lashof, director of the climate and clean air program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a U.S. environmental group.
"It's the kind of year we expect, given the global warming trend is ongoing."
