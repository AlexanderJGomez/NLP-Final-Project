Mexico City stores, such as this supermarket, can no longer give out non-biodegradable plastic bags.
China has adopted a strict limit, reducing litter and eliminating the use of 40 billion bags, the World Watch Institute said, citing government estimates.
Mumbai, India, outlawed the bags in 2000 and cities in Australia, Italy, South Africa and Taiwan have imposed bans or surcharges.
"Thin-film, single-use plastic bags, which choke marine life, should be banned or phased out rapidly everywhere," Steiner said in June.
Mexico City, which has had some of the worst air pollution in the world, also is looking at improving its environment in other ways.
