(CNN) -- Iran has threatened that it will retaliate against the Obama administration's proposed new economic sanctions on Iran's oil exports by blocking the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf.
Sanctioning Iran's oil industry will cripple Iran's economy, and that in turn will threaten the stability of the clerical regime.
The administration's strategy is based on the assumption that cutting Iran out of the oil market will not substantially impact world oil supply and prices.
Iran notes that Western economies are under stress and predicts they could not afford higher oil prices.
Those advocating new sanctions on Iran's oil industry have said little about the potential cost to the global economy.
War between the U.S. and Iran may very well start, not if and when Washington decides to strike against Iran's nuclear facilities, but because sanctions designed as the alternative to military action end up hastening its advent.
