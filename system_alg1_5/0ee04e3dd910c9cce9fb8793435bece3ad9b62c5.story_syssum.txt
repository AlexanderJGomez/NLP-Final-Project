London (CNN) -- A breakthrough in graphene research which could pave the way for new smaller, faster, more powerful computer chips has be made by UK researchers.
"Creating the multilayer structure has allowed us to isolate graphene from negative influence of the environment and control graphene's electronic properties in a way it was impossible before," Leonid Ponomarenko, lead author of the study.
Commenting on the new research, Geim said: "Graphene encapsulated within boron nitride offers the best and most advanced platform for future graphene electronics.
"We are constantly looking at new ways of demonstrating and improving the remarkable properties of graphene," Geim said.
The U.S.'s Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, have recently discovered that graphene "exhibits a novel reaction to light," which they say could improve night-vision systems and possibly provide a new approach to solar power.
It turned out to be untrue, but bendable phones, computers and televisions may not be far off, says Ferrari.
