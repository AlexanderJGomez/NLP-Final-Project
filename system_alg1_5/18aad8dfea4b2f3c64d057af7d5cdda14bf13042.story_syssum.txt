Many of the questions were too long to duplicate here, so we included excerpts and a link to the full comments.
Iaconesi: Hello.
If you, tomorrow, have to go through cancer, you will be able to benefit from all this work already done, with contacts, different strategies combined in critical, harmonious ways, documented testimonies, ways to access the various services etc.
What I am also asking is to go beyond the idea of eHealth, and to not limit this whole thing to an "administrative" or, even worse, "bureaucratic" process, because this is really harmful to people, both the "diseased" ones and the rest of the members of society.
In Italy, for example, we have a very good welfare system for health.
Tim: Please seek qualified, legitimate sources for your treatment.
Iaconesi: Dear Tim, actually "ordinary people" have been incredibly helpful, through their testimonies, experiences and evaluations.
I won't even go, for now, into the enormous implications at a psychological, social and cultural level which I myself and many, many people are perceiving.
To do this, I explicitly ask people (doctors, researchers, regular people... ) who contribute, to compare their approaches, also critically, and to try to understand how and if they should/could be combined, and to what extent.
Iaconesi: This is one of the things we're working on, with a lot of researchers and designers.
Something which goes beyond eHealth, and looks at the whole story of people: emotional, lifestyle *and* medical, including data, imaging, history etc.
Iaconesi: That is a good point, actually.
All of them.
(themselves) and with the other people as well.
But if you really speak (and I mean really) to someone who has, you will learn some incredible things.
Furthermore, many of them are compatible with each other.
This is what, for me, is looking like the best possible option.
