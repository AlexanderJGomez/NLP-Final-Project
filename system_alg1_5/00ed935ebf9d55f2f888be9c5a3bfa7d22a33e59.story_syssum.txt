John Edward Jones, 26, of Stansbury Park was stuck in the Nutty Putty Cave, which sits west of Utah Lake near Cedar Valley, according to the sheriff's office of Utah County.
"They had him to a level spot where he wasn't heading downhill with his head below his feet," Cannon said.
"Getting people to him is very difficult," Cannon told KSL before Jones died.
Up to 5,000 people visit each year, the site said.
