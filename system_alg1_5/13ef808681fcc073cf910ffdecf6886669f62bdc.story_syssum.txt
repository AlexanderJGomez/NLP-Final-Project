Fannie Mae foreclosed on the Akron, Ohio, home of Addie Polk, 91, after acquiring the mortgage in 2007.
She'd say 'I would run from trouble, that's about it,'" Smith said.
"She wasn't a really vocal person," Smith said.
"Given the circumstances, we think it's appropriate."
In 2004, Polk took out a 30-year, 6.375 percent mortgage for $45,620 with a Countrywide Home Loan office in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio.
"Never did reach her, but always left notes," Fatheree said.
"This bill does nothing for the Addie Polks of the world," Kucinich said.
