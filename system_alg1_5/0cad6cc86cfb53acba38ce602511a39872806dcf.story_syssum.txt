"The dining car developed axle problems that disabled the train 2 miles north of the Staples Mill Road Station in Richmond around 5:30 p.m. Sunday," said Amtrak spokeswoman Kimberly Woods, via e-mail.
"The train was between stops so safely removing the passengers or arranging alternate transportation was too problematic," Woods said.
"If you are a corporation that alienates its customer base, you ain't going to have customers," Smith told CNN affiliate WTVR.
"A delay of this magnitude is considered rare and we understand the passengers' frustrations from last night's events," she said.
