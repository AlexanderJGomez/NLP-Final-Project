Since passage, the cries have shifted from rationing to repeal.
He should do the job he was elected to do and protect patients' interests, but he will need to face a confused public.
But health care reform will not be repealed, and despite messy politics and angry voices, policymakers, providers, insurance companies and other stakeholders are moving quickly to implement the bill.
Last week, the Senate voted on two amendments regarding the 1099 provision in the Affordable Care Act introduced by two senators, one by Sen. Mike Johanns, a Republican from Nebraska, and another by Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat from Florida.
But more importantly, a repeal of health care reform, followed by a replacement with a more modest set of changes, is tantamount to leaving millions of patients in a state of free fall, with no net to catch them.
From there, adults and seniors will no longer have cost-sharing provisions for preventive services.
Together this all adds up to more patient protections than we have ever had, and this is just the beginning.
As patients, we should ask questions and not be afraid to challenge our health care system, insurance companies and government officials when we are left feeling confused or misguided.
