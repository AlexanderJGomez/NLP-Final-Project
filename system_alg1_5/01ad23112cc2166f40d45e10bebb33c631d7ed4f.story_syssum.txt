Undercover FTC agents posing as customers found "significant violations" in 23 of the 102 funeral homes investigated, according to the FTC.
In those cases, the FTC contacted the funeral homes and required proof they were addressing violations.
Jessica Koth of the National Funeral Directors Association says the "NFDA takes compliance with the Funeral Rule seriously."
-- In Richmond and Fredericksburg, Virginia, eight of 19 funeral homes inspected had significant violations.
