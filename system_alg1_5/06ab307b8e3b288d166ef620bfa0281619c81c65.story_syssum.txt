And so it is.
Why it was, until Monday, our greatest day of the year.
The runners stream through Kenmore Square, a block away from where other, considerably better-paid athletes are engaged in more sedentary pursuits.
To be honest, I have never attended the marathon in person, let alone run in it.
It is, nevertheless, something that all of us here take pride in.
Sadly, the marathon will not be the same after today.
And we are.
