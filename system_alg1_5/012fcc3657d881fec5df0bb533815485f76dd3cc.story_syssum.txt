The song, written by the group's John Phillips and his wife, Michelle, was called "Creeque Alley."
Phillips left his first wife, Mackenzie's mother, Susan Adams, for 18-year-old Michelle, whom he'd met in a San Francisco club while touring in the early '60s, according to the band's biography on Allmusic.com.
In his 1986 memoir, "Papa John," John Phillips, who died in 2001, remembered hosting parties for the Beatles when they visited town.
There was a 1971 reunion that produced the contractually obligated album "People Like Us," but the experience was "horrible," John Phillips recalled in the liner notes to the group's anthology, "The History of the Mamas and the Papas."
John Phillips, who married Genevieve Waite in 1972, became increasingly immersed in drugs, says his Allmusic biography, to the point where he couldn't finish an album commissioned by the Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger and Keith Richards.
In her new book, "High on Arrival," she claims she had become sexually involved with her father in 1979, after he forced sex on her the night before she married a rock manager, Jeff Sessler.
"Somebody could have dropped a piano on my head, and I probably wouldn't have felt it," Chynna Phillips told the magazine.
He toured with versions of the Mamas & the Papas, some including Mackenzie.
"I am stunned by Mackenzie's terrible allegations about her father," Waite, John Phillips' third wife, wrote in a statement released to "The Oprah Winfrey Show."
And Mackenzie's half-brother, Tamerlane, the follower of an Indian guru, is having none of it.
"Worship Nityananda, not the Phillips family."
