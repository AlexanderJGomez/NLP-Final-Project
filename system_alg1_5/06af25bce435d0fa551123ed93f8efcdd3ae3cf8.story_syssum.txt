"Gigi Jordan showed no mercy to her son, and should receive none at the time of her sentencing," Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said in a statement.
And, apparently the jurors got it."
To the extent that the jury has said this was not a mother viciously, violently, coldly doing away with her child, that's a triumph."
When police arrived at the hotel, they found Jordan sitting next to the bed where her son lay unresponsive, surrounded by pills and pill bottles.
"This was not an act carried out with murderous intent," Brenner told jurors in closing arguments.
"You're a dead woman," she claimed he told her.
Jordan said the boy was physically and sexually abused not only by his biological father but also by others, including the woman who took Jude to school.
"At some point, I put the pills together," she recalled.
"A lot more of the Ambien," she said.
Brenner sought to show that Jordan, believing she was ultimately protecting her son, brought the drugs to the hotel room with the intention of killing them both, but she survived the suicide attempt.
As Jude lay dying, the prosecution said, Jordan sent an email to a financial adviser instructing him to transfer the $125,000 trust she set up for her son to her personal account.
