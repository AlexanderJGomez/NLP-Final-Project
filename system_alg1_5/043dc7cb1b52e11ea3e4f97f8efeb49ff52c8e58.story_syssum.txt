More unique is the conversation's focus on misogyny and its negative impact on women and men, Maxwell said, pointing to tweets from men as evidence.
There was backlash to the hashtag's sentiment, too.

"While there's a lot of harm that can happen online, the Internet (has been) so fundamentally transformative for women and feminists," she said.
