Alton Alexander Nolen, 30, was shot inside the Vaughn Food processing plant but regained consciousness in the hospital, said Jeremy Lewis, spokesman for the Moore police department.
The postings include numerous all-caps messages about Islam and quotations from the Quran, but make no reference to job dissatisfaction.
Nolen had tried to convert co-workers to Islam, officials said.
"He wasn't targeting anyone, wasn't going specifically after them," the police spokesman said.
Nolen was put on probation, KOKI reported.
The trooper, Betsy Randolph, told CNN on Saturday that Nolen started struggling after she put a handcuff on one wrist.
Mary Fallin, Alex Weintz, noted the governor had blocked Nolen from receiving parole in 2012.
