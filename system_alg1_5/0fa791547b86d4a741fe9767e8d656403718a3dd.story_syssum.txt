A federal appeals court in Chicago last month ruled in favor of California-based editor and lawyer Leslie Klinger, saying he did not have to pay royalty fees to the Conan Doyle estate, over his plans to publish a new volume of Holmes stories penned by contemporary authors.
"Many aspects of these characters' natures are not revealed until the final 10 stories, which are still under copyright protection" say the estate's lawyers.
But he refused to pay a fee for a planned November sequel, "In the Company of Sherlock Holmes."
Thus, to put it very loosely, Sherlock Holmes is 'free.'"
The case is Conan Doyle Estate Ltd. v. Klinger (14a47).
