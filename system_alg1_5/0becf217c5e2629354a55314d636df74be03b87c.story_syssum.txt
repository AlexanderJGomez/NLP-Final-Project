"Simply put: It is time to move on," Nelson said in the statement.
Kerrey, 68, is a Medal of Honor winner from the Vietnam War who, like Nelson, served as both a Democratic governor and senator.
Jim Manley, the former long-time spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said Nelson was often a "thorn in Harry Reid's side."
"The party has stood by him,  but when the going gets tough, he abandons the party."
"Public office is a place for public service, not personal profit," Nelson's statement said.
