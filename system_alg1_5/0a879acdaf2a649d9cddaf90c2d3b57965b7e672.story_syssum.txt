Geldof, who had two children younger than 2, had been supported by drug treatment workers for 2Â½ years, being prescribed methadone, he said.
However, in February, witnesses reported suspicions that she had started using heroin again.
The couple's younger son, Phaedra, was in the house at the time, having been dropped off by Cohen's father the previous afternoon.
She was not under the influence of alcohol at the time of her death, tests revealed.
Kent police continue to investigate who supplied the heroin to Geldof, but no arrests have been made.
