The Puerto Rico Police Department, the second-largest police department in the United States, was the object of a scathing report by the ACLU that concluded things have not changed since the government issued its own report.
Such police brutality is pervasive and systemic, island-wide and ongoing," the new report states.
"For some agents it was something ingrained, in some members of the force," McClintock said.
Over a five-year period from 2005 to 2010, more than 1,700 officers -- or about 10% of the total police force -- were arrested for criminal activity such as assault, theft, domestic violence, drug trafficking and even murder, the report says.
At one point, one of the brothers took the officer's nightstick and hit him with it, and the other hit him with a pipe, police have said.
