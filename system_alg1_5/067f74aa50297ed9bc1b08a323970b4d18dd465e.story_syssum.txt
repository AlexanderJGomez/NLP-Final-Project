Like smartphones, this new breed of tablets will run Android, an operating system developed by Google.
Using the Android Market website in a browser, you can browse, buy and download apps, Google announced at a news conference on the company's main campus here on Wednesday.
"There are no wires, no syncing to computers, none of that kind of nonsense," Chris Yerga, Android's engineering director for cloud services, said onstage at the Android event.
"It's the cloud that makes the experience seamless," said Andy Rubin, who leads Android development.
Skype does not offer a video-calling app for Android.
They also showed an action-packed, medieval-themed game that taps into the hardware's multicore processors.
"We've spent a significant amount of effort making sure that existing Android apps run well on tablets," Hugo Barra, Android's director of product management, said onstage.
The first tablet to launch with the new version of Android is Motorola's Xoom, which debuts this month.
T-Mobile and AT&T also announced more information on new Android phones this week, none of which will run the Honeycomb software at first.
