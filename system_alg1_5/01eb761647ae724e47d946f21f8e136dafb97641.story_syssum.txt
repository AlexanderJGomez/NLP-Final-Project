The 911 call played twice in court on Friday, his lawyers claim, back up their assertion that it was Martin, and not their client, who was the aggressor.
This instance, though, Gladys Zimmerman admits was different.
O'Mara then raised the possibility her son, not Zimmerman, was to to blame.
"What I hoped for," said Fulton, "is that nothing happened and he'd still be here.
The prosecution suggested Zimmerman, whom they painted as a neighborhood watch volunteer who overstepped his bounds, had "profiled" Martin because he was black.
and then say, "Get off," before their call was cut off.
But so does Gladys Zimmerman of her own son, the defense lawyer says, arguing that "all the other evidence would suggest" that the screaming voice is indeed that of George Zimmerman.
"I think the jury is going to look at this and say both of these women just have to live with the belief that it is, in fact, their son," O'Mara said.
Jahvaris Fulton, Martin's older brother, testified Friday morning about the voice on the 911 call.
Bao said the muzzle of Zimmerman's gun was likely in loose contact with Martin's clothing, indicating that the teen was shot at close range.
His heart was bleeding until there was no blood left," the medical examiner said as autopsy photos lingered on a courtroom screen, adding that Martin was "suffering (and) in pain."
When asked about them, Bao said, "I typed out potential answers to your potential questions."
The defense attorney pressed Bao, too, on the collection of Martin's clothes and scraping of his fingernails.
There is "no other reasonable hypothesis" for what happened, the defense attorney argued, besides self-defense.
