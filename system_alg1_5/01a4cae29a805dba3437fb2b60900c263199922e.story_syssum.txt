Now, days later, as investigators continue to search through what the Worcester County District Attorney's Office describes as the home's "deplorable conditions (such as) massive insect infestation, mounds of used diapers and feces," a picture is beginning to emerge of the family that lived inside.
Rivera also "presumably" did not know about the ones that had died, at least according to the account Murray has told authorities, Halpern said.
Halpern said that while his client's explanation "is not based in reality," the situation  Murray came to be in was the result of fear, not malice.
"She was terrified of the pregnancies being discovered," said Halpern.
"I feel certain that she did not do anything to harm any of these children," he said.
For now, Isaksen said DCF has Murray's four children in its care and is focused on  "ensuring (their) safety and well-being and providing them with the proper medical care, support and services they need," she said.
"Our investigation will continue for quite some time," said Joseph Early, the Worcester County District Attorney.
