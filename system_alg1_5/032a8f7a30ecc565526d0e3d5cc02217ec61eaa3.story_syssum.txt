A solar eclipse happens when the moon, as it orbits Earth, passes directly in front of the sun, obscuring its rays and casting a shadow on Earth's surface.
A total eclipse of the sun can only be seen from within what's known as the path of totality, a narrow path the moon's inner shadow travels as it glides across the Earth.
What time total darkness occurred, and how long it lasted, depended on location.
But for any given region, a total solar eclipse only happens, on average, once every 375 years.
There are changes in the color of the sky, the temperature drops, birds and animals behave in a peculiar manner and shadows sharpen, according to Rick Brown, an eclipse chaser from New York who is viewing his 14th total solar eclipse.
It's a phenomenal thing to see," he said, recalling his first experience.
On Twitter, there was a tweet-up devoted to the event and you can always get first-hand accounts of the event on iReport, where we asked people to share their solar eclipse photos and experiences.
That means when viewing any partial phase of a total eclipse, you need to wear proper solar eclipse glasses.
Eclipse Chasers, a website devoted to solar eclipses, has several pointers for photographers.
-- Keep your setup as portable, light and easy to assemble as possible in case you need to relocate in a hurry to escape clouds.
