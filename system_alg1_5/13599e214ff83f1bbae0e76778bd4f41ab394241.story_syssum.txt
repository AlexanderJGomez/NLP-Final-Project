(CNN)  -- The United Nations has sent police and military patrols to a camp in western Sudan after reports fighting there killed civilians, a U.N. spokesman said Tuesday.
"There are many figures being thrown around and we hesitate to give any numbers before we are sure," he said.
The Sudanese government said it entered the camp to look for "huge quantities of arms and criminals," Nezni said.
In the past five years, an estimated 300,000 people have been killed through direct combat, disease, or malnutrition, the U.N. says.
