Europeans, who welcomed Obama as the candidate of change, didn't expect him to agree with them on everything, but they believed that he would at least listen to them.
Europeans, who don't possess America's military might and who nearly always, in Winston Churchill's words, prefer "jaw, jaw to war, war," also welcomed Obama's early overture to Iran indicating that if Teheran would unclench its fist, then America was ready to extend its hand.
But while Europe's diplomats and politicians know that the president, too, has to strike political balances, and while they recognize that shared values across the Atlantic won't always mean shared interests, a few niggles are creeping in.
Obama, said Lord Ashdown, was trying to appeal simultaneously to two different audiences.
The Europeans, while they like much about Obama's style, are growing just a little uneasy about how things will pan out under his presidency.
But they can see that power is moving inexorably from the the G8 to the G20, where Europe's influence will be diluted by major new players like China and India.
The slight unease one senses now in Europe's capitals is, in a sense, less a personal slippage for Obama than a growing recognition of the weakness of a debt-ridden U.S. economy and of the inability of the world's strongest military power to contain Islamic insurgencies or to find and dispose of Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar eight years after the mass murders of 9/11.
Blair, after all, remained hugely popular in the U.S.
But so discredited did he become back home that he was forced to step down and hand over power to Gordon Brown.
