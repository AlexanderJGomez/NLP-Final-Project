Lance Armstrong is racing in the California Amgen Tour as he attempts a comeback after retiring in 2005.
Armstrong improved from 10th to fifth overall, one minute five seconds adrift, with Astana teammate Levi Leipheimer, the two-time defending champion, in second place behind Mancebo.
That was terrible," commented Armstrong who had a puncture.
Armstrong, 37, won the Tour de France, considered the premiere bicycle race in the world, a record seven times from 1999-2005.
He raced last month in the Tour Down Under in Australia, finishing 29th.
