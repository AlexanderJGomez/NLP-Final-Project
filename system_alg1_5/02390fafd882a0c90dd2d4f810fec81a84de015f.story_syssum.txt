If enacted, Thailand would join several Asian countries, including India, Pakistan and Nepal, that have recently moved to recognize third gender.
The old constitution recognizes people of different religion, age, gender -- but had not extended to transgender people.
At the same time, the most difficult thing is at a professional level, that people don't accept people like us," said Jenisa Limpanilchart, a businessperson.
It's difficult for transgender people, despite their education level, to get hired and accepted by companies, she added.
While recognizing the third gender would not resolve all the challenges, it would be "history" for our advocacy work, she added.
According to a 2012 report by the Global Commission on HIV and the Law, 20 countries have passed progressive legislation on the issue, including Argentina, Uruguay, and Portugal.
And Thailand does not have plans to legalize same sex marriages in its constitution, said Sittisamarn.
