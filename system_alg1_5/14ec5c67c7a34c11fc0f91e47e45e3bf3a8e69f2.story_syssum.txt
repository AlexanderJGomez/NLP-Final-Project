At a New York press conference, the company also introduced Nintendo TVii, a free TV and movie service that utilizes the Wii U's handheld controller, with its built-in screen, as a remote control and tablet-of-sorts for additional content.
"We've come here today not just to make news, but to give you a better sense for how Wii U will change the way you play games, how it will connect your gaming friends and how it will change the way you watch television," he said.
"The Wonderful 101" and "Bayonetta 2," both from Platinum Games, will be exclusive to the Wii U.
"Nintendo's presentation and vision is far more comprehensive and compelling than what they showed at the past two E3s," he said, referring to a summer video game conference.
The presentation made strides with the hardcore gaming crowd, but that key holes remain, he said, notably titles like "Bioshock: Infinite," "Tomb Raider" and "Grand Theft Auto V." Questions still remain about which, if any, of those titles will be coming after the launch period.
