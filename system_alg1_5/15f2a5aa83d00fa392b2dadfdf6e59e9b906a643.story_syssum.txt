At least 109 people died in and around Hama, said Avaaz, a global activist group, citing a medical source.
The activist group, citing the medical source, said scores more were wounded.
People who tried to leave, he said, were being shot.
One of the sources is a representative of the Syrian Revolution Coordination Union, an opposition group.
At that point, the demonstrators returned to the mosque and closed themselves inside, the sources said.
The protesters were allowed safe passage out of the mosque after they promised to end their protests, the sources said.
"It's crucial that a U.N. Human Rights Council fact-finding mission to Syria is able to investigate the situation as soon as possible," said Jose Luis Diaz, Amnesty International's representative to the United Nations.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group, issued on Thursday an update about Deir Ezzor, a city in the country's northeastern region.
They include not paying government employees, halting wheat deliveries to bakeries, preventing hospitals from rescuing wounded protesters, and asking governmental medical staff to leave their posts.
That's because it is questionable whether the move, absent constitutional reform, could end decades of single-party Baathist rule.
