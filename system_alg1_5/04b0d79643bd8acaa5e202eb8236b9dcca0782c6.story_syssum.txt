Paris, France (CNN) -- French lawmakers Tuesday recommended a partial ban on any veils that cover the face -- including the burqa, the full-body covering worn by some Muslim women.
Such a resolution, if passed, would not make the wearing of a full veil or burqa illegal, but it would give public officials support when asking people to remove it.
Commission members heard from 200 people from all areas of French society, including Muslims, though they only heard from one woman who wears a veil.
More than half of French people support a full ban, according to a recent opinion poll.
However, women who actually wear the veils deny that.
The women, both French citizens, say they are only following their religious beliefs and France should respect that.
He said it is ridiculous to do so in France.
France is not the only European Union country to consider banning the burqa.
