"With all the things going on in America today, that's fairly insensitive," Reid told reporters on Capitol Hill.
Cassidy made the comments during an interview with an energy trade publication.
"Congressman Cassidy may not realize this but the language he used included a term that is incredibly offensive to many Americans and he should immediately apologize," Maness said in a statement.
"I wish there was as much offense taken by Harry Reid running the Senate dictatorially, not allowing any votes which he does not personally approve of and the result of which he does not endorse," Cassidy said in a statement to the Washington Post.
"We all make mistakes and when we do, we should have the fortitude to own up to them," Maness said.
