The tape has been around for decades, but during the London 2012 Olympics, it has been spotted stretching and spiraling in interesting patterns on some athletes.
Paul Ullucci Jr., a Rhode Island athletic trainer who is on the board of the National Athletic Trainers Association, says he received a call Friday from a patient about the tape.
"She said she had been watching the Olympics, saw the tape on sale, and wondered if she should buy it," he says.
According to Adam Halpern, education director for Kinesio, Kase's patients kept telling him they felt great in his office, but the impact of his healing hands would diminish after a while.
"I was just at the Olympic beach volleyball game between Russia and China with him, and both of the teams were covered in it," Halpern said.
Some, however, are skeptical about the tape's effects.
When people see athletes who are doing so well, they think, 'Maybe this could work for me,'" he says.
"It definitely feels like it is doing something, and helped me feel better in training," Rogers says.
"I have hamstring issues and I kept trying it, but the stuff just wouldn't stick to me," she says.
It's pretty-colored cotton tape."
