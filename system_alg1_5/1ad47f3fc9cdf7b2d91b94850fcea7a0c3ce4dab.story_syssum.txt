The announcement that Russia's prime minister, Vladimir Putin, will run for president in next March's election and will, if elected, appoint the current president, Dmitri Medvedev, as his prime minister brings to mind one of the most famous lines of Italian literature.
It will provoke a temporary burst of indignation from Putin's many critics in the West, some of whom saw in Medvedev a champion of liberalism and civil rights.
Yet the reality is that Putin's return to the Kremlin will not, in itself, change much.
Despite rumors of disagreements between the two leaders -- or, more often, their aides -- Putin and Medvedev have always worked together as a close-knit team.
Obviously, these two goals at times conflict.
During the financial crisis, the prime minister spent lavishly to soften the pain, increasing pensions by 24% in real terms in 2009 and another 13% in 2010.
But the support, although high, is thin, resting on economic performance and little else.
Medvedev's political constituency has been the urban, educated elites in business, academia, the arts, and other spheres.
He may have to back away from a commitment to triple defense expenditures -- a promise that prompted Alexei Kudrin, the long-serving finance minister and leading budget hawk, to say he would refuse to serve under Medvedev.
The need to trim social spending threatens to turn Medvedev into a lightning rod for discontent, and could shorten his tenure.
