Untold thousands more in this country were living with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV.
For those of us caring for people with AIDS, it was a dark time.
Scientifically proven prevention approaches -- education and outreach to at-risk populations, voluntary HIV testing and counseling, condom distribution, prevention of HIV transmission from mother to baby, harm reduction approaches for drug abusers, mass-media campaigns and the screening of donated blood -- have been deployed with great success in the United States and many other countries.
However, now is no time to rest on our accomplishments or our laurels.
Globally, 33 million people are living with HIV infection, most of them in the developing world.
In low- and middle-income countries, less than one-third of people in need of anti-HIV therapy are receiving it, and only one in five people at risk of HIV infection have access to prevention services.
Barriers to implementation of HIV testing guidelines, such as state, local or agency regulations that conflict with the recommendations, variability in payment coverage for the test, and concerns about the stigma and discrimination that may accompany an HIV diagnosis, must be addressed.
Encouragingly, new means of preventing HIV infection are emerging from well-designed and well-implemented clinical research trials.
Finally, a preventive HIV vaccine remains the greatest hope for halting the relentless spread of HIV/AIDS.
Developing HIV interventions and delivering them to the people who need them will require scientific and public health vision, and dedication from all sectors of society, in good times and bad.
