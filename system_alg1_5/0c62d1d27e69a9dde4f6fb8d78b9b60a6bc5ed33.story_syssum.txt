Robertson interviewed Meshaal over the weekend in Qatar, where he lives.
Up until now have been killed 1700 people, while we have killed 63 soldiers.
We kill soldiers, while they kill civilians."
The fighter, just like the soldier in the army, his job is to protect the people, and not to sacrifice the people for himself."
Our steadfastness is a victory.
Robertson pressed Meshaal on the point, asking how this can be a victory for Hamas and its cause when so many Palestinians are dying.
Hamas has agreed to cease-fires through Egyptian mediators "many times" since 2003, Meshaal said.
They know that Hamas is very credible in that if its leadership promised something, it will fulfill its promise, and the fighters on the ground will follow that."
Hamas is not to blame for the lack of a solution, he said.
"There are two kinds of cease-fires: There is the humanitarian cease-fire, like 72-hour cease-fire that was meant to help and aid our people getting food, water, and help collecting the bodies.
