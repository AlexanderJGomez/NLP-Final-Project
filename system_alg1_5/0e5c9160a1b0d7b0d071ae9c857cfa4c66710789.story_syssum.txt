A "qualified" woman, African-American or Hispanic.

Sure, go ahead and say, "Man, you're being too sensitive!"
Part of the issue is that a lot of folks have bought into the notion that any minority has gotten a job based on their skin color or a woman is hired because of her gender, so therefore, we better emphasize the need for a "qualified" person.

Yeah, right.
It's simply time that when it comes to women or minorities, we should retire the use of word "qualified."
