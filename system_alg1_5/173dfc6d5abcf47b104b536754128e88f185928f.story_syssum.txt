The mystery behind four days of unexplained shaking and odd sounds rattling Clintonville, Wisconsin, has been solved.
"In other places in the United States, a 1.5 earthquake would not be felt," she said.
"It was just pop-pop-pop," she said.
Since Sunday, the shaking has happened nearly every night, quieting down during the day.
Some Clintonville residents were even holding "shake" parties at night, waiting for the rumbling.
While the cause of the shaking has been solved, it's still not clear if the rattling in Clintonville is over, Kuss said.
"All throughout the eastern United States, even small earthquakes are felt great distances," Caruso explained.
"When seismic waves travel through the ground, they're moving ... faster than the speed of sound and when they hit the surface," Caruso explained.
But usually when there's a big earthquake, people either don't hear the sounds because the frequency is lower than the threshold of what humans can hear.
