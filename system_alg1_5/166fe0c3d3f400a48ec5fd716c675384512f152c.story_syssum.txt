Raul Castro was chosen Sunday to take over Cuba's presidency from his brother, Fidel Castro.
"The country's priority will be to meet the basic needs of the population, both material and spiritual, based on the sustained strengthening of the national economy and its productive basis without which, I'll say it again, development would be impossible," Raul Castro said in a speech Sunday.
Cubans, too, are calling for reforms, though not all of them related to productivity.
Still, changes are inevitable, he said.
But the degree of change remains uncertain, as does the possibility that "even from the shadow Fidel will try to discourage reforms," he said, adding "the prognosis, nonetheless, is hopeful."
We have disagreements, yes, but how do we resolve them without talking?"
