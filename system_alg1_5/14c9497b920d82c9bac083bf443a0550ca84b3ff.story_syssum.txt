Johannesburg (CNN) -- South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu turned 80 on Friday, days after a spat with the government over a visa delay that forced the Dalai Lama to cancel a trip to the nation.
"Please take care," the Dalai Lama said.
"When we used to apply for passports under the apartheid government, we never knew until the last moment what their decision was," Tutu said at a news conference.
Tutu and the Dalai Lama are recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize.
This is not the first time the Dalai Lama has not been able to visit South Africa.
