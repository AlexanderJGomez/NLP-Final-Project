(CNN) -- Not so long ago, the idea of a Casey Anthony movie seemed like a certainty.
"Anyone who pursued a movie based on these events, especially right now, will face some immediate backlash," said Matthew Belloni, news director for The Hollywood Reporter.
And Paradigm, another big talent agency, signed Anthony's lead attorney, Jose Baez, for representation, only to "un-sign" him several hours later after facing a drumbeat of criticism.
"I do think there should be a movie made" about the case, Cooper said.
"I think she's got the chops," Cooper said.
"You've got to believe that something this high-profile, something that everyone is talking about ... that eventually, this will become a movie," he told CNN.
"Then you have this outcome that many people can't reconcile with the facts," he said.
