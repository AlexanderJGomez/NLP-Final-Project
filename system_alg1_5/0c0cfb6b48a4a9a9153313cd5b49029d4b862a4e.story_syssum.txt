"Early this morning, troops from Niger and Chad launched ground and air raids against Boko Haram into Nigeria, and the operation is still continuing," said a military official in the border town of Diffa, Niger.
"Around 6 a.m., soldiers from Niger and Chad in huge numbers confronted Boko Haram around the Doutchi area outside Diffa and later crossed the bridge into Nigeria," said Diffa resident Ari Boubakarna.
â€ŽAnother contingent of troops, backed by air support, moved out from the town of Bosso, Niger, according to residents.
Nigeria has vowed to liberate all of its territories from Boko Haram before the general elections, which begin on March 28, to enable displaced residents return to their homes for the elections.
