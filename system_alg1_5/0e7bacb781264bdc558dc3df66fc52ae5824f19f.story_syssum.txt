ABC is filming a proof of concept for a revival of "The Muppets," The Hollywood Reporter has learned.
ABC's "Muppets" revival is being produced by ABC Studios and The Muppet Studios, which Disney owns.
For Prady, the revived "Muppets" — which landed at ABC after initial interest from Netflix — marks a return to his roots.
Should ABC order "Muppets" to series, Prady would juggle both that project and CBS' "The Big Bang Theory," which he exec produces.
On the feature side, the franchise featured 1992's "The Muppet Christmas Carol," 1996's "Muppet Treasure Island" and 1999's "Muppets From Space," the latter two of which were co-produced by Disney, who acquired rights to the Muppets in 2004 and formed The Muppets Studio.
On the comedy side, "The Muppets" arrives as it has become increasingly challenging to launch original scripted half-hours.
