The minister, Ali al-Amrani, was headed to the prime minister's office when the attack occurred, spokesman Abdul Basit al-Qaedi told CNN.
Al-Amrani was not hurt in the attack, al-Qaedi said.
The minister recently launched a massive presidential campaign to support candidate Abdurabu Hadi, the country's current vice president.
Executive powers have already been transferred to Hadi.
