Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- Some of the families camped outside the San Jose mine, waiting for rescuers to reach 33 workers trapped underground, fear Chilean President Sebastian Pinera may be playing politics with the rescue operation in an effort to boost his popularity.
They're playing with the feelings of our loved ones," said Nelly Bugueno, mother of trapped miner Victor Zamora.
Outside the mine Sunday, some family members said they were angry that the rescue effort was being turned into a political spectacle.
All I care about is that the president gets our boys out," said Cristina Nunez, wife of miner Claudio Yanez.
The mining minister and the rescuers have done a good job, but the president is playing with us," she said.
The president arrived at the mine at midmorning Sunday, flying in on a military helicopter that landed in the desert, kicking up dust.
The drill, known as Plan C, began operating Sunday.
Sunday was the first day that all three drills were working simultaneously, Pinera said.
