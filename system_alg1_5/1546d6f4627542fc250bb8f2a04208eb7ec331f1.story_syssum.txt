New York (CNN) -- A day after saying homosexuality is not "an equally valid or successful option," New York gubernatorial candidate Carl Paladino denied being anti-gay Monday but said it was "disgusting" that his opponent took his children to a gay pride parade.
"It's terrible, and it shouldn't be.
"My nephew is a wonderful boy and he's gay," he told "Good Morning America."
Asked whether he believes homosexuality is a choice, Paladino said, "I've had difficulty with that.
"There was a couple lines in there that I deleted and never spoke, purposefully, because I didn't want to," he told CNN.
"Somebody wrote them and gave them to our staff as their suggested position on something," he said.
I don't think they should be married," he told CNN.
"Don't misquote me as wanting to hurt homosexual people in any way," Paladino said Sunday.
"I think my comments were directed at just the confusion that people have had over this issue," he said.
"That's not the example that we should be showing the children and certainly not in our schools," he said.
However, they are not," said Christopher Barron, chairman of the gay conservative group GOProud, in an e-mail to CNN.
"Carl Paladino's statements are unfortunate and show he lacks an understanding of what it means to be gay," said Gregory T. Angelo, chairman of the group.
It isn't."
"Watch," Paladino said before walking off.
