In recent years, social games have become increasingly prevalent on mobile devices, providing entertainment, yes, but also a way to maintain contact with family and friends.
"I always get the free version (of games) to make sure it is Voice Over compatible, which is what makes the iPhone and the iPad talk," she said.
But only one game, she says, has let her both play and communicate with friends.
Fisher said "Hanging With Friends" specifically works with Voice Over and lets her "see" what's going on and chat with her family and friends who are playing.
Fisher said there are other games that are Voice Over compatible, but they don't allow for the social interaction that "Hanging With Friends" does.
" 'Hanging With Friends' really wasn't my type of game until I started playing it," she said.
