John Bieniewicz, 44, died at Detroit Receiving Hospital from injuries suffered in what police said was an unprovoked attack.
"He had a passion for his family, a passion for the kids at Mott Children's Hospital, and a passion for soccer.
He was being held on $500,000 bail, police said.
The site said Bieniewicz was a licensed soccer referee at all levels, professional, collegiate, high school and children's leagues, was president of the Metro Detroit Soccer Officials Organization, and sometimes refereed three games on a Saturday.
A judge ordered the teenager, who was not named publicly, to keep a picture of Portillo in his cell for the remainder of his time in juvenile jail.
