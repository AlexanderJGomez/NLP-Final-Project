Rome (CNN) -- Mario Monti, the economist nominated to become Italy's new prime minister, began talks with political leaders Monday to discuss forming a government.
To take the helm, Monti needs the approval of the Italian Parliament, which is composed of multiple parties with diverse interests.
Antonio Di Pietro, leader of the Values Party, said his group is "happy that the Berlusconi government could be replaced by the Monti government."
Franceso Rutelli, leader of the Alliance for Italy, also told reporters his block will support Monti's government.
"For the time being he is waiting to see what is happening under the buildup of the new government under Mr. Monti," said Deborah Bergamini, a member of Italy's Parliament and former assistant to Berlusconi.
In announcing Monti's nomination, Italian President Giorgio Napolitano said the former European Union commissioner is "gifted, competent, experienced" and well-respected in Europe and internationally.
"This is the moment of his test," Napolitano said.
Economists said Monday's bond yields could indicate that markets are still nervous about Italy's economic prospects, even with Monti in charge.
