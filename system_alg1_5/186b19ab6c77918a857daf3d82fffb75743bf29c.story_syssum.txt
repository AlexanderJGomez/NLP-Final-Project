Some of the artworks housed in the Centre d'Arts, which was in a wooden structure, will be more repairable, he said.
Only cement can do this," he said, picking up some of his punctured pieces.
"At that time, the paintings were my last concern," he continued.
"This is like a hospital for paintings," he said, watching his staff strip off frames and backings.
"Hopefully this is raising awareness and shedding light on both the beauty of Haiti and its people, as well as the incredible needs there," he said.
High above the misery, Exil, too, said he will paint again.
"It's a great loss for all of us," Exil said of the earthquake.
For the future of Haiti.
