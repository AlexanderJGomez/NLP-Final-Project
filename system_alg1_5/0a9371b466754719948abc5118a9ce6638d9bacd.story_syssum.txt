"There was a time when many people thought that I was going crazy," said Soriano, a native of La Gloria, Colombia.
Soriano, 38, is a primary school teacher who spends his free time operating a "biblioburro," a mobile library on donkeys that offers reading education for hundreds of children living in what he describes as "abandoned regions" in the Colombian state of Magdalena.
To help bridge the learning gap, Soriano decided to personally bring books to the children.
A second donkey, Beto, follows behind, toting additional books and a sitting blanket.
"It's not easy to travel through the valleys," Soriano said.
"For us, his program complements what the children learn in school.
Despite these injuries, which left him with a limp, Soriano has no intention of slowing down.
That's how a community changes and the child becomes a good citizen and a useful person," Soriano said.
