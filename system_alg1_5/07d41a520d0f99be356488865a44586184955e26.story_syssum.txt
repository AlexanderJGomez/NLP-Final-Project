The 220,000-square-foot addition will be used to find cures for childhood cancers, and will double the Huntsman Cancer Institute's research space, said the 76-year-old businessman and philanthropist, father of former Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman Jr.
His family "has put about $400 million into the cancer center, and we've raised about a billion dollars for cancer research (overall)," he says.
For the latest expansion, "the family is putting about half of it up," he says.
After selling that company, he founded Huntsman Chemical Corp.
Huntsman's mother, who taught him about the importance of giving, died from cancer, as did his father and stepmother.
Huntsman himself has also battled cancer, and has survived prostate cancer, mouth cancer and two types of skin cancer.
