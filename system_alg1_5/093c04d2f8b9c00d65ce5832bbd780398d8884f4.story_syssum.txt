Prescription drug abuse is a national epidemic, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
The pain pills, unlike cocaine or heroin, are often bought legally -- at least at first.
"The illegal prescription drug market and relative ease of which pharmaceutical substances can be obtained has resulted in a sharp increase in prescription drug abuse," said Harry Sommers, special agent in charge of the DEA's Atlanta division.
A prescription with all the words spelled out or with perfect handwriting is also suspicious, according to the DEA.
Most doctors are in such a hurry, they will use abbreviations, and doctors are not typically known for neat handwriting.
