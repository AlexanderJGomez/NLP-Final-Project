Kaka waves to supporters during Milan's match with Fiorentina on Saturday.
Milan's supporters are on Kaka's side, because they believe it is club officials who want to sell him.
Privately, most Milan supporters would probably agree with Berlusconi's reasoning.
"Berlusconi, Interista" read another one, referring to Inter, the city's other top team and AC Milan's archrivals.
At the end of the game Kaka's teammates hugged him and he waved again towards the supporters.
Was he saying goodbye to them -- or to a $150 million move to Manchester?
