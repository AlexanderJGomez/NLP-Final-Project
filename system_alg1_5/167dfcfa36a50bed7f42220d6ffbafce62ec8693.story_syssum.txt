Barcelona may have made the headlines for Lionel Messi's record breaking exploits over the course of the last week, but the Catalan club's arch rivals responded by making their own little piece of history Saturday.
All the focus after the game, however, was on the new club record.
In the day's early La Liga fixtures, Athletic Bilbao ran out 2-1 winners away to mid-table Getafe while Espanyol had too much for Levante, running out 2-1 winners.
Elsewhere in France Saturday, Monaco's stuttering start to the season continued with a 2-0 loss away to fourth placed Rennes.
Goals from Aymen Abdennour and Ola Toivanen were enough to ensure Leonardo Jardim's side couldn't follow up their impressive Champions League victory over Bayer Leverkusen earlier in the week.
