Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Early-morning commuters in much of the Deep South, braced for the possibility of a second round of snow and ice, had an easier-than-expected ride Monday as warmer temperatures kept winter weather at bay.
ET, the temperature in Atlanta was 41 degrees, well above the freezing mark, and rain was falling.
Snow flurries are forecast later Monday as an Arctic front moves through, Morris said, but no accumulation was expected outside mountainous areas.
The National Weather Service was forecasting a slight chance of snow before noon, then a mix of rain and snow, with an above-freezing high of 36 degrees.
"It happened too fast," said motorist Sam Skramstad, who was driving home to Colorado.
During that period, 8.8 inches of snow fell on Harkers Island, North Carolina, according to weather service data.
As of Friday, according to the National Weather Service, 68.1 percent of the United States was covered with snow, compared with 51.2 percent in January.
