George Zinkhan, a professor at the University of Georgia, disappeared after the slayings of his wife and two others.
Authorities say Zinkhan fatally shot Marie Bruce, 47, Zinkhan's wife and a prominent Athens attorney, Tom Tanner, 40, and Ben Teague, 63, on April 25.
After the shooting, Zinkhan left with his children -- ages 8 and 10 -- in the car, police said.
He drove to a neighbor's home in nearby Bogart, Georgia, where he lived, and left the children with the neighbor.
