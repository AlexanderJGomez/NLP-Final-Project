Taxicab drivers clogging the streets of Europe this past week, protesting against Uber, are only part of the challenge.
Still, the business model is brilliant, the growth eye-popping and the initial Uber experience is generally excellent.
According to its Terms & Conditions agreement, Uber is not a transportation service.
The car drivers are Uber's actual customers.
Lane Kasselman, Uber's spokesman, didn't directly address this question of liability when I asked him about it in an email, but points to company attention to passenger safety, noting Uber is "the first to ensure end-to-end insurance coverage for ridesharing."
I am sure there are fellow riders who, like me, take issue with the company not disclosing their passenger rating in the Terms & Conditions or privacy policy for the app.
And, again, I may not be alone feeling more than a little uncomfortable asking my driver for my rating.
And then there's change.
For Uber to get the value of its disruption, in the form of consumer goodwill, people will need to know why Uber-instigated changes in the taxi industry are good, not bad.
Explain to the entire ecosystem of drivers, riders, regulators, regulated, investors and employees the value and benefit of the turmoil Uber brings when it rolls out in new markets.
Investors have spoken, and they're all in for Uber.
Otherwise, down the road, a competitor might more easily turn my head: one that delivers exactly what they promise me.
