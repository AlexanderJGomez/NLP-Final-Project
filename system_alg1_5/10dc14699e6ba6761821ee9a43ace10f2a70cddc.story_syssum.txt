Carrillo Fuentes, known as "El Viceroy," was one of Mexico's most wanted alleged criminals.
He died while undergoing plastic surgery in 1997, leaving his brother, Vicente, in charge of the cartel.
Authorities said last week that they arrested Hector Beltran Leyva, leader of the Beltran Leyva Cartel, while he was dining in a seafood restaurant in San Miguel de Allende.
"He was one of the most important of the most important that Mexican justice had to capture," he said.
