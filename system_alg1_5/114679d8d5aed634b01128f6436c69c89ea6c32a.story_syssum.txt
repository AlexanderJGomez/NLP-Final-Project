The blind man, identified by CNN affiliate NY1 as Cecil Williams, was walking on the subway platform with his service dog when witnesses describe him slipping and falling onto the tracks.
A nearby MTA employee, described by Baldeo as a construction flagger, jumped into action and tried to calm the man.
"It's a miracle," Williams' girlfriend, who only wished to only give her first name, Cynthia, told CNN affiliate NY.
"He's doing great," Cynthia said.
