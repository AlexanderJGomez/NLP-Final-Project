Speaking to ABC's "This Week," Clinton also said the president has answered the central question she raised about him when she was his chief rival for the Democratic nomination last year.
"Absolutely," Clinton replied.
"I never had any dream, let alone inkling, that I would end up in President Obama's cabinet," she said.
But Obama "was quite persistent and very persuasive," Clinton said.
And finally, I looked around our world and I thought, you know, we are in just so many deep holes that everybody had better grab a shovel and start digging out."
Asked whether there is any room for compromise on that issue, Clinton said the administration would not "prejudge the effort."
"One of the positive developments," she said, is that "it has actually brought the [other] members of [the] six-party process -- Japan, South Korea, China, Russia, the United States -- much closer together" in how they view the challenge.
"We're going to look at it," Clinton said.
"It is a humanitarian issue and the girls should be let go," Clinton said.
