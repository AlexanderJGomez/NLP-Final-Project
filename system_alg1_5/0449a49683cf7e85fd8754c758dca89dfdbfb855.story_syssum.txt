The District of Columbia Court of Appeals "ruled resoundingly in favor of the Chung family and denied Mr. Roy Pearson's appeal of the case completely," said Christopher Manning, an attorney for the Chung family, who own Custom Cleaners.
"The past three years have been very difficult, but we hope this nightmare is finally over."
During a two-day trial, Pearson, who represented himself, said that when he took the pants to the cleaners, his financial situation was precarious: He had just been ordered to pay $12,000 in attorney's fees to his ex-wife, and his credit cards were at their limit.
Pearson may request that the appeal be heard again by the entire panel of D.C. Court of Appeals judges, Manning said.
"The 3Â½ years this case has been pending and appealed have been very difficult for the Chungs," he said.
