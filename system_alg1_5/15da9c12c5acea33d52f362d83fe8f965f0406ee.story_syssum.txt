Asked which school meals were their favorites, students at a public school in the New York borough of Queens don't say chicken fingers or meatballs.
"We decided on a vision where health and nutrition would be a part of educating the whole child," school principal Bob Groff said.
"Rice was a staple of many of their home foods," Groff said of the students.
That, Groff said, "changes how the kids perceive it."
But "the vegetarian menu fits right in with our mission, and we are thrilled that our students in pre-kindergarten all the way up to grade three understand the importance of healthy and nutritious meals," Groff said in a statement.
"As far as we know, (Active Learning) is the only public school in the nation that offers an all-vegetarian menu," Feinberg said.
