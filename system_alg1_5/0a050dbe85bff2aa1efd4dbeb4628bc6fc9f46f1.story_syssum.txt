Starting out with a boutique store in Auckland, New Zealand, during the mid-1980s, Cooper's ascent onto the fashion stage -- and the front covers of Vogue and Marie Claire -- is made more remarkable by the fact that she never received any formal training as either a designer or seamstress.
My ranges are full of influences from 19th-century French, English, even American vintage styles.
I'm also obsessed with detail, so when I find a Victorian gown or a 50s bridal slip that I like, then it's important for me to be able to emulate the exact stitching, embroidery or beading used at the time.
From one village to the next you find whole families, generations, that have their own specialties of stitch work.

It sounds garish, but on her, with the quality of the dye and the way the colors had been combined it looked absolutely stunning.
However, what I took back to New Zealand, was their techniques, their intense celebratory colors, their detailed embellishments, their expert use of beads and sequins.
But I'll only know I have finished the creative process when someone comes in and says that, no matter what, they have to have it.
