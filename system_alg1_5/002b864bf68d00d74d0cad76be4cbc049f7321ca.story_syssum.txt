Man Haron Monis, an Iranian-born refugee who was granted political asylum in Australia in 2001, had "a long history of violent crime, infatuation with extremism and mental instability," Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters.
"They should have put him away and thrown away the key," the dead woman's godfather, Ayyut Khalik, told NBC News.
He said Monis used to beat Pal, forcing her to wear a hijab all the time and forbidding her from talking to "outsiders."
The letters were "sadistic, wantonly cruel and deeply wounding," one High Court judge said at the time, according to CNN affiliate Seven News.
His broader cause, he said, was lobbying governments around the world, particularly Australia, not to wage wars on Muslim soil.
Under the image, it reads, "This is an evidence for the terrorism of America and its allies including Australia.
The more you fight with crime, the more peaceful you are."
Hundreds of police officers, including snipers, took position around the Lindt Chocolate Cafe in Sydney's central business district.
Hours into the crisis, at least five hostages managed to escape, running terrified toward police in riot gear.
Police later announced that the siege was over and that the lone gunman had been killed.
