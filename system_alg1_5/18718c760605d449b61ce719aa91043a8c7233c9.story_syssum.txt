The burning of the Qurans -- which the U.S. claims was accidental -- was a fresh outrage to many Afghans.
In contrast, Sunday's mass murder is not a new outrage for Afghanistan.
Sunday's mass murder, in other words, is not a game-changing event.
The insurgency, on the other hand, is obsessed with influence, undermining confidence in the government, and creating the perception that the U.S. is at war with Islam.
That's not a strategy, and it's not a plan.
But shifting Afghanistan from a military engagement to a political one would, by design, extend U.S. operations there.
Ultimately, Afghans will suffer the consequences -- of Sunday's raid, of the war, of America's withdrawal from the region.
