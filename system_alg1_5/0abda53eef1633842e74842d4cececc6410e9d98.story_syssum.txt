"I have never experienced anything this big, this serious and this tragic," said Barber, who announced the news at a somber press conference.
A judge on Tuesday set a $1 million bond for Hoffman, who is accused of keeping Sarah bound and gagged in his basement, authorities said.
said Barber.
But, in the end, the crucial information came down to Hoffman, Barber said.
When asked whether the incident was a home invasion, Barber said it was not, but added that "either they knew Hoffman or Hoffman made himself known to them."
Dawna Davis, who lives next to Hoffman, said she did not trust him.
He just climbed trees and watched us," she said about Hoffman.
