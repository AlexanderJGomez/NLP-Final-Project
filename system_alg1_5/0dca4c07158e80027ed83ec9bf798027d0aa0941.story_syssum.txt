Construction on the city state's new structure for Changi Airport, the Jewel Changi, is underway.
More than simply a new terminal, Jewel Changi Airport will be constructed on the site of the old parking lot fronting the existing Changi Airport's Terminal 1, and will be "seamlessly connected" to the existing terminals, according to the airport.
On completion, it'll be the world's tallest indoor waterfall, according to the airport.
On the top level, Canopy Park will have gardens, walking trails, playgrounds and eateries spanning approximately 13,000 square meters.
"In order for Changi Airport to stay ahead amidst intensifying competition from other airports, it's important for continuous innovation to be introduced," says Goh.
