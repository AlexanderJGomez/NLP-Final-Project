Taking a cue from some of its competitors, Apple on Tuesday announced a smaller version of its popular iPad tablet -- the iPad Mini.
It will have the same display-resolution specs as last year's iPad 2, not the high-definition "retina display" of the newest iPad, which also got an update on Tuesday.
The device's screen has the same proportions as the larger iPads, meaning that apps designed for the tablet should also look good on the Mini.
"This isn't just a shrunken-down iPad," Schiller said.
said Schiller, while presenting an update of the company's smallest desktop computer, the Mac mini.
It weighs 3.5 pounds, making it the lightest MacBook Pro ever, Schiller said.
Released only six months ago, Apple's newest full-sized iPad also got an update, getting a faster A6X processing chip, an improved camera and, like the iPhone 5, 4G LTE capabilities.
When the iPad came out, it was intended to be a consumption device.
"Fully half the time they're using tablets, they don't leave the couch or the bed," said Forrester analyst Sarah Rotman Epps.
That would also be a boost for Apple in the education market, which it has been courting heavily.
