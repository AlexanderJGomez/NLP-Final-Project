The most minor tumult, the smallest change, and immediately we pronounce the word.
When President Viktor Yanukovych, after months of promised, rejected the deal in November, Ukrainians protested.
In December, hundreds of thousands of people, from all parts of the country and all walks of life, were on the streets.
After weeks of peacefully tolerating beatings, torture and disappearances, some of the protesters took the fight to the police.
On the day of mourning, the Ukrainian government mounted snipers on rooftops.
They simply, and amazingly, built their barricades, stood their ground and said they would give their lives for their freedom.
They disappeared from the fight, and ceased to protect him.
Ukraine is now once again a parliamentary democracy, with presidential elections scheduled for May, and an alert population preserving the peace and watchful of its own newfound rights.
The state, unsurprisingly, is close to bankruptcy.
Indeed, the men and women of the Maidan, although they want their country inside the West, were extremely disappointed with Western inaction during their revolution.
Ukrainian oligarchs have parked hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars in Western banks: some of it, just possibly, illegally.
The Ukrainian revolution, like any revolution, can fail.
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has claimed, without any evidence, that Russian citizens in Ukraine are under threat.
In one that is not, Russian policy might provoke nationalists, and conflict can begin again.
They wanted, in other words, the things that most of us take for granted.
