Masked men drag the bloodied body of a man across a public square, and tie it to a make-shift cross on a metal pole.
Three days on, the "crucified" body of the man and another victim were reportedly still hanging in Raqqa.
Abu Ibrahim, a member of a recently formed anti-ISIS activist group in Raqqa, says the remaining five victims were children under the age of 18, one of them a seventh-grade student.
Simply murdering in a state of constant warfare is void of value, so they must attach a message or propaganda to what they are doing," Barzegar says.
According to a set of rules issued to Raqqa's Christian minority, members of the faith must pay a special tax to the militants and may not expose crosses, repair churches, or recite prayers in the presence of Muslims, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported in February.
ISIS reacted almost immediately to the campaign, sentencing the activists to death for "non-belief in Islam and their advocacy of secularism," and offering a large cash prize for any information on their whereabouts, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
"Life here is very hard.
It's that easy for ISIS," Abu Ibrahim says.
The worst part is people are too afraid to ask about their husbands or sons," Abu Ibrahim says.
"The word is often more powerful than the bullet, and the will of the people is the most powerful of all," Abu Ibrahim says.
