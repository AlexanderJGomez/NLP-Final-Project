It seems oddly fitting that "Copper," premiering on Sunday at 10 p.m.
For Anastasia Griffith, the world of "Copper" came to life as she was laced tightly into her corset, learning to breathe as her character, socialite Elizabeth Haverford, would breathe.
"It's about honoring the details," Griffith said.
"There is something very underdog-ish about all of the characters played by Kyle Schmid, Anastasia, Ato and I," Weston-Jones said.
Meanwhile, he reconnects with two men, aristocrat Robert Morehouse, played by Schmid, and physician Matthew Freeman, who Corcoran fought alongside during the Civil War.
"It was really about marrying two aspects: being tightly bound physically but at the same time, being very spirited and free inside," she said.
Amidst the turbulence, "Copper" hopes to illustrate where America, and New York, came from by showing such a pivotal point in the city's history.
"Sex, drugs, violence and Sir Mix-A Lot," Schmid and Weston-Jones joked.
