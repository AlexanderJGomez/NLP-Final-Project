The comments, by Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem, were made Monday as ISIS fighters seized control of a strategically important air base in the country.
Obama has authorized reconnaissance flights over Syria, which could begin at any point, a U.S. official told CNN on Monday.
The Islamic extremist group, which has taken over large areas of Syria and Iraq, wrested the Al-Tabqa air base from the Syrian military on Sunday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based group that monitors the conflict.
When contacted by CNN, the German Foreign Ministry declined comment on the ISIS statement.
Al-Tabqa air base is the last major military base in Raqqa province, which borders Turkey, to fall into ISIS' hands.
The warplanes from the base had already been taken to other locations before ISIS took control, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.
Senior U.S. defense officials said last week that they hadn't ruled out extending airstrikes against ISIS into Syria.
