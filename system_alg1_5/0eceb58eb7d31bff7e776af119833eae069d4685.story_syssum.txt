Lovelle Mixon, 26, is accused of fatally shooting two Oakland patrol officers and fleeing to a nearby apartment building.
The panel, made up of law enforcement experts, said the two officers made a mistake in the traffic stop when both approached the car on the driver's side.
"As a consequence, no one knew who was in charge, adding to the confusion and disorganization," the report says.
The gunman shot the first two officers who entered the apartment, killing one of them.
But, in all, the report found 11 things that Oakland police did well during the incident and 23 things that needed improvement.
