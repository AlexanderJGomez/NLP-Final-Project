"I wake up in the middle of the night and it feels like my eyes are on fire, my eyeballs and I think, 'Oh, maybe I have sand in my eyes or something,'" Anderson said.
"We have sunscreen we can put on our skin, but we don't have eye drops that offer a protective film for the cornea, so it is really important that everyone, and especially people with fair or light eyes, wear sunglasses that protect against both UVA and UVB rays," says Sarnoff.
We can get a sunburn, and we can heal from it, and the inflammation can go away, but it can add to the chronic damage and put us at risk for skin cancer," says Sarnoff.
Thankfully, with numbing and antibiotic eye-drops, it only takes a couple days to recover.
To keep your eyes safe, wear sunglasses and a hat with a three inch brim, advises Sarnoff.
