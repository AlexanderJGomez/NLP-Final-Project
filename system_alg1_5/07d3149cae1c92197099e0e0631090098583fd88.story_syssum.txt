AUSTIN, Texas (CNN) -- Lady Bird Johnson, who was first lady during the 1960s and in her later years became an advocate for beautifying public landscapes, died Wednesday, family spokesman Tom Johnson said.
"Lady Bird Johnson embodied all that is beautiful and good about the great state of Texas," Perry said.
The former first lady was born Claudia Alta Taylor in 1912 in Karnack, Texas, a small town near the Louisiana line.
Early on, Lady Bird Johnson proved herself to be the quintessential political wife.
After three failed pregnancies, she gave birth to the Johnsons' first daughter, Lynda Bird, in 1944, followed by Luci Baines three years later.
With Kennedy's assassination, Johnson became the 36th president.
In the landslide election of 1964, Lyndon Johnson won victories in the Northeast, West and Southwest.
During her husband's one term as president, Lady Bird Johnson worked tirelessly for the beautification of America, promoting the Highway Beautification Act, which sought to limit billboards.
The center was renamed the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center in 1998.
