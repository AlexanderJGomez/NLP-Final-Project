"Everything that we do is done with the patient at the center of the picture, not the doctor at the center," Nissen says as he takes a visitor on a tour of the clinic's world-renowned cardiac center.

"Everyone wants to do their procedure," is how Nissen explains the most frequent result.
At the Cleveland Clinic, Nissen and other doctors are paid a fixed salary.
"Seventy percent of the cost in health care is from chronic disease," Cosgrove told us in an interview at his Cleveland Clinic office.
"We believe that the government ought to incentivize quality," Nissen said.
And if you are not doing a good job, then you ought to be paid less."
"If you begin to take money away, my concern is that you begin to drive quality down," he said.
"The concern right now is 50 percent of the hospitals in the United States are running in the red," he said.
In another cautionary note, Cosgrove, however, said over time he believes widespread electronic record keeping -- and sharing -- will lead to fewer duplicative tests and other cost savings, but that the jury is still out on that question.
"What we've seen is our quality's gone up -- substantially," Cosgrove said.
