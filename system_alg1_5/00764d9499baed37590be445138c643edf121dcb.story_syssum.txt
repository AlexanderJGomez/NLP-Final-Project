Every single president in our nation's history, except for John F. Kennedy -- a Catholic -- and Barack Obama, has been a white Protestant.
But it's over.
I'm sincerely not gloating.
And my jibes are in jest.
However, in the GOP's defense, a party that is 90% white, they have started to slowly showcase minorities, such as Sen. Marco Rubio and Govs.
This is a testament to our nation.
Well, it's kind of complicated (as these things tend to be).
In our first presidential election in 1789, no women, no blacks, no poor white men, and in many states neither Catholics nor Jews, were permitted to vote.
(Although poll taxes, literacy laws and other measures were still employed in some states to disenfranchise black voters.)
And some of them won.
(Of course, he is the back up to Mark Sanchez.)
