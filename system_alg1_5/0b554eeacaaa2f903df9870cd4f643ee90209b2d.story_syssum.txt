Despite the closure of the last British-owned volume car maker, Rover, in 2005, the country is now building near-record numbers of vehicles while the proportion of cars exported is the highest ever.
The booming Rolls-Royce sales figures come days after its former sister company, Bentley, posted a 37% rise in global sales, also on the back of rising sales to China and the U.S.
In the 1970s, 545,000 people were employed in Britain's car factories, making 15 million cars during that decade.
Rolls-Royce's sales figures are the best since 1978 when the company sold 3,347 cars, mainly of the Silver Shadow II model.
The Rolls-Royce brand was doing well, he said, because it married British heritage with BMW's sales and marketing expertise.
"You can't go wrong with that mix," Reid told CNN.
"This is something that we are doing well, despite our own car market doing badly."
