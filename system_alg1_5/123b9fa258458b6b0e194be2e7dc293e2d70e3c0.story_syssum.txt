(CNN) -- The U.S. Navy has started a force to battle pirates attacking ships in and near the Gulf of Aden off Somalia's coast, the U.S. Fifth Fleet said Thursday.
The United States is among at least 20 countries that are trying to combat piracy in the region, including Russia, India, Germany and Iran.
"The problem of piracy is and continues to be a problem that begins ashore and is an international problem that requires an international solution," Vice Adm. Bill Gortney, commander of the Combined Maritime Forces, said in a news release from the Fifth Fleet in Manama, Bahrain.
"The pirates are living between life and death," a pirate leader, identified by only one name, Boyah, told the Somali news organization Garowe Online late last year.
Boyah said.
"We went into the deep ocean and hijacked the unarmed cargo ships," Boyah said.
"Some navies in our coalition did not have the authority to conduct counter-piracy missions," Gortney said.
The U.S. Navy praised merchant mariners' measures against pirate attacks, such as raising ladders, posting lookouts, speeding up, taking evasive maneuvers and using fire hoses.
