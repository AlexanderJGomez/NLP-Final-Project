Humala, an ex-army officer who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2006 as a leftist ally of Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, reinvented himself as a more moderate leader.
He has cited needs to improve the nation's infrastructure, water, sanitation and education, particularly in rural areas.
Humala defeated Fujimori's daughter, Keiko, to win the presidency.
In another minor controversy, the outgoing president, Garcia, did not attend the swearing-in ceremony to pass the presidential sash to his successor.
