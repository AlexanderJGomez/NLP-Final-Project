For the results to be binding, more than 30% of Facebook users had to participate in the vote, which was hosted on the site by a third-party app developer.
In his blog post announcing the vote last week, Facebook vice president of communications Elliot Schrage said, "If turnout is less than 30%, the vote will be advisory."
Another update would change how Facebook shares user data with companies it owns or partners with, most notably Instagram.
But unless 299 million virtual votes were somehow misplaced, the results are clear.
