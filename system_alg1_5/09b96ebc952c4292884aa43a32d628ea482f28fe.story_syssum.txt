"I was on the path to not living old and this bothered me," he said.
"When they announced I was the winner of the challenge, it was a very emotional experience for me," Smith said.
"By nature, I think many people are procrastinators, and losing weight was something I always wanted to do but was on my procrastination list," he said.
"I had known people who participated in the challenge last year and were successful at it, so I thought I'd give it a try," he said.
After he started the fitness challenge, he added healthy food to his diet, such as fruits, vegetables, fish and chicken, and he eliminated fatty foods and red meats.
"It took a lot of effort for me to change my lifestyle, but once I started seeing the pounds shed away, it gave me the motivation I needed to keep going," Smith said.
"Paul's program was the jumpstart I needed, and now I am continuing my weight loss journey on my own," he said.
"I look forward to spending many healthy years into the future with my grandkids, and am glad I am taking the necessary steps to do it," he said.
