"Resolutions alone will not be enough, promises on paper cannot keep us safe, lofty rhetoric and good intentions will not stop a single terrorist attack," Obama said.
The resolution passed Wednesday requires nations to "suppress the recruiting, organizing, transporting, equipping" and financing of "foreign terrorist fighters," according to Obama.
"We must work to address ... the oppression, the lack of opportunity, too often the hopelessness that can make some individuals susceptible to appeals of extremism and violence," he said.
But, as Obama said, what made Wednesday's vote notable is that "it is very rare where the United Nations achieves the kind of consensus that we see represented in this resolution."
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, for instance, warned "against any attempt to narrow down the problem" to select groups, urging the world not to have "double standards in dividing terrorists into good terrorist and bad terrorists."
"I can promise you that the United States of America will not be distracted or deterred from what must be done," he said.
But, Obama said, America cannot do it alone.
If Russia rolls back its involvement, the United States "will lift our sanctions and welcome Russia's role in addressing common challenges," Obama said.
Climate change:  The United States will work on the issue within its own borders, but "we can only succeed in combating climate change if we are joined in this effort by every major power," Obama said.
"That's how we can protect this planet for our children and grandchildren."
