"It's completely immoral what's happening there," he says.
"You've got a public school and a public highway" on the base, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said.
The federal government owns and operates the base, but the state and county have held a "use easement" for more than a half-century, and they maintain the roads.
Vandenberg's commanding officer in 2003 issued a "barment order" against Dennis Apel after he was arrested for trespassing and vandalism, including throwing blood on a base sign.
A federal appeals court eventually ruled in his favor, saying the special protest zone was not an area under the military's "exclusive right of possession."
"When an easement goes towards a public road, that easement includes the right to use the public road for speech activities," he said.
It's their base.
And if that's the deal, take it or leave it, state: 'We'll give you this easement, but the terms are what we have said.'
One of the arguments that the government makes is, look, what the military wants to do here is something very sensible.
"They're denying my right to dissent on their base," he said.
"They're systematically trying to keep me out there, but I'm not going away."
