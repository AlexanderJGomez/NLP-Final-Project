Players control Titus, a captain of the Ultramarines, as they and their comrades attempt to battle orks, demons and the forces of Chaos.
Hand-to-hand weapons can be knives, swords, axes and hammers while long-distance weapons start with pistols and go all the way to cannons.
But it is more than just blood and gore (which, incidentally, gets splashed all over your character during battle, then magically disappears afterward) that make "Space Marine" worthy.
Each character has his own feel and motivations, giving personality to even the lowliest speaking ones.
The ending, a cliffhanger of sorts, really was a jaw dropper.
"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine" is available for the PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
