Boardwine's friend, Joyce Bruce, had used his sperm and a turkey baster to get pregnant.
Boardwine initially was hesitant when Bruce approached him in 2010 with the turkey baster idea, the court document says.
No luck.
She and Boardwine tried a few more times, and in July, she learned she was going to have a baby.
Then they argued.
So he took the matter to court.
The appeals court affirmed the lower court's ruling, saying the turkey baster doesn't constitute reproductive technology.
