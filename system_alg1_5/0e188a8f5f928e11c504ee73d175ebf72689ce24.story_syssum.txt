Allen informed Obama that he will leave the service rather than move forward with the nomination, which requires Senate confirmation, a White House statement said.
It is now my turn to stand beside them, to be there for them when they need me most," he said.
On Tuesday, Obama called the general one of America's finest military leaders.
Allen "presided over the significant growth in the size and capability of Afghan National Security Forces, the further degradation of al Qaeda and their extremist allies, and the ongoing transition to Afghan security responsibility across the country," Obama said in the statement.
About 150,000 ISAF members were deployed at that time, including just under 100,000 U.S. troops.
A graduate of Georgetown University and the National War College, Allen also drew distinction for his counterinsurgency work in Iraq, particularly in the country's volatile Anbar province in 2008, where he helped isolate a growing insurgency.
