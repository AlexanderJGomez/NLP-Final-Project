"Mohamed told me and his brother that ISIS took him," according to Said Musallam, his father.
They said you will have girls, money, cars, villas, paradise, but afterwords he discovered that there is nothing."
About a month ago, Said Musallam said, he was told his son was taken by ISIS when he was on his way back and trying to cross the border.
"I used to take care of him and babysit him when Mom went to work," he said, crying.
In the ISIS video, Musallam seems to be reading what appears to be a prepared confession, saying he is an Israeli intelligence agent working for Mossad, sent to infiltrate ISIS.
If he was an agent he would have lived a beautiful life," his mother, Hind Musallam, said.
Last August, a photo posted to Twitter from an ISIS stronghold showed a 7-year-old boy holding a man's severed head and his father's words, "That's my boy."
