"Either Mitt Romney, through his own words and his own signature, was misrepresenting his position at Bain to the SEC, which is a felony, or he was misrepresenting his position at Bain to the American people to avoid responsibility for some of the consequences of his investments," Stephanie Cutter, deputy Obama campaign manager, said on a campaign conference call.
Only one, Bain Managing Director Steve Pagliuca, would talk on the record.
Nothing.
Nothing.
To be clear, all four of the sources voiced professional loyalty and personal respect for Romney.
More significant, though, is that Cutter statement about responsibility for "his" investments.
Bain negotiated the Stericyle investment deal in November 1999, nine months after Romney said he left.
"You don't see his name anywhere -- in the meetings list, the investor documents, the manager paperwork -- it would have to be there if he was involved in any way," one current Bain officer said of Romney and Fund VII.
