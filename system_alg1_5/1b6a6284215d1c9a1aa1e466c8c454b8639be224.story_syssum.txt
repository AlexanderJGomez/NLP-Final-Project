If the bone is human, authorities said, they would attempt to determine through DNA testing if it belonged to Holloway.
Dave believes it is Natalee," Miller said about Holloway's father, Dave Holloway.
Also on Monday, police collected a second bone that was found earlier this month on the beach by a New Jersey family, said Ana Angela, spokeswoman for Aruban prosecutors.
The family, who was staying at the Westin, put it on their hotel balcony.
Holloway was last seen in the early hours of May 30, 2005, leaving an Oranjestad nightclub with Joran van der Sloot and two other men.
Van der Sloot, 23, is also charged with wire fraud and extortion in Alabama for allegedly attempting to extort more than $250,000 from Holloway's family in return for disclosing the location of her body.
