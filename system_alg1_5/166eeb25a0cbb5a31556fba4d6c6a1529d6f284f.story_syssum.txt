"There will always be risks associated with deep-water drilling," Salazar said.
Critics of the ban, including Republican leaders, Gulf state officials and Gulf Coast residents, said it would only hurt oil and gas workers in the already hard-hit coastal communities, where hundreds of jobs were lost because of the disaster.
"This is a very deliberative policy process," Gibbs said.
"We will not approve permits without vital supplemental information required by the rules," said Bromwich, director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement.
"This deepwater drilling suspension was always about keeping the Gulf workers and waters safe from another oil spill, and it has been effective in doing so," Markey said in a statement.
"Today's actions are premature," said a statement from Peter Lehner, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council.
"We learned from this spill that we have only a tiny fraction of what's necessary to control deep water oil spills," Guest said in a statement.
"The policy position we've articulated today is that we're open for business," Salazar said.
