And then, around a corner, everything changes.
Due to a lack of industry, Anren would likely have remained a backwater but for local landlord Liu Wencai, whose legacy has driven the town's rebirth as an historic destination.
Some have been transformed into galleries or museums dedicated to a variety of subjects, such as film, and are open to visitors.
Most, though, lie behind locked doors.
Despite its colourful history, Anren didn't evolve as a museum town until Jianchuan Fan, a real estate developer-turned-collector-and-curator, decided to open a private museum here in 2003.
Come Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, however, it's a bustling tourist spot bathed in a sea of visitors.
Ticketed exhibits follow themes -- there's the War Series, the Red Series, the Earthquake Series and the Folk Series.
The Red Series contains the most distinctive exhibits.
The estates are split into four main areas: the Liu Family Old Manor, Liu Family's Historic Home, Precious Artefacts Gallery and Rent Collection Hall.
Dominating the center of the old town, along Hong Xing Street, Yu Ming Street, Shu Ren Street and De Ren Lane, are Anren's Old Mansions.
There's about 5,000 old films at the museum, so you never know what you might be watching.
Galleries, mostly displaying traditional art, are free to enter.
