"So, we've withdrawn them from the school for a short while."
Boyle, in a CNN interview Thursday, said the boys were paid "way over and above what you could pay," despite media reports to the contrary.
"If they stay in school until they're 18, a substantial sum of money is released to them then, which will effectively change their lives for the better," Boyle said.
"The children were paid well," Boyle said.
"The money that would be released to them when they are older, that is the kind of thing that can be mortgaged off by gangsters," he said.
