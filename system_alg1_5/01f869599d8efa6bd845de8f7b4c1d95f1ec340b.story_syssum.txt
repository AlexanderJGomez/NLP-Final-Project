In "Defiance," Edward Zwick tells the true story of the Bielski brothers, Tuvia (Daniel Craig), Zus (Liev Schreiber) and Asael (Jamie Bell).
Ari Folman's angst-laden nonfiction animated film, "Waltz With Bashir," is altogether more relevant.
Zwick's Hollywood liberal credentials are not in doubt, but his films have a surprisingly gung-ho undercurrent (they include such martial adventures as "The Last Samurai," "Glory," "The Siege," "Legends of the Fall" and "Courage Under Fire").
Dour and dourer as the movie goes on, Daniel Craig looks rugged in a weathered leather jacket and cloth cap, but his Bond associations aren't exactly helpful.
Schreiber's Zus, on the other hand, joins with the Soviets to take the fight to the Germans.
"Defiance" is a hard slog, at times.
