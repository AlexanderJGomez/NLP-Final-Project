So when I learned CNN's Talk Asia had booked the Beach Boys for an interview in Hong Kong, I jumped at the chance to interview Al Jardine, Mike Love and Brian Wilson.
Incredibly, after half a century of recording and performing, they are not a tribute band to their 20-something selves.
"Surfer Girl," released in 1963, marked Wilson's emergence as a producer.
"The night we cut the vocals was one of the highlights of my life," says Wilson.
"Good Vibrations" is a multi-layered pop symphony with nearly everything thrown in -- sleigh bells, cello, harpsichord, even a theremin -- one of the earliest electronic instruments.
It was a good scary."
"They are all masterpieces," says Love of the Beach Boys' full playlist.
And then it hits me, I'm being serenaded by The Beach Boys.
"Off to a buffet somewhere," quips Love with a smile.
