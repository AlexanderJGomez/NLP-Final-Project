Nanci Griffith, who says she's "fed up with negativity," was revitalized by the election of Barack Obama.
However, with her latest album, "The Loving Kind" (Rounder), Griffith is as focused and passionate as she has been in years.
"In some ways, I'm just a journalist.
And then, after [the 2008 election], everything came spilling out.
That was such an inspiration.
Griffith: No, never in my life.
CNN: Now, in addition to "The Loving Kind," there are other songs based on actual events on this record.
Griffith: Not really.
Griffith: I do.
Griffith: It's about people like him.
Right now, he is my hero.
It's just what you do.
