If so, you might not recognize the newest product dreamed up by the brain trust at Radio Flyer's Chicago, Illinois, headquarters.
"We approached this product much like an automotive company might with a concept car," said Mark Johnson, Radio Flyer's product development manager.
"Music is such an important part of kids' and families' lives, we thought it would be great to have a speaker system built in the wagon," said Tom Schlegel, vice president of product development.
To develop those ideas, Radio Flyer's designers are using state-of-the art technology.
"Radio Flyer survived the Great Depression, and this year has been a difficult year for a lot of companies," Schlegel says, "But Radio Flyer is actually growing this year.
Since then, Radio Flyer has become perhaps the world's most famous maker of wagons, tricycles and other toys.
But the spirit of Radio Flyer, which conjures memories of a simpler time, remains intact.
