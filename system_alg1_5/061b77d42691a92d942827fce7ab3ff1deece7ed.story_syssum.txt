Then, like many of the friends you meet in those horrible, wonderful years, I never saw or talked to him again.
In our class, it was me and Brian.
Over time, we became friends.
On top of that, he was really smart.
I saw this quality in him tested, maybe even stretched to the limit, in our junior year.
Whatever the reason, the absences and missed assignments were taking a toll, and things came to a head in English class.
Still, inside the pages of my yearbook, he wrote a note thanking me for all the help.
On the night of October 22, 1995, Brian James Hull was struck and killed by a drunken driver as he and his roommate walked to a convenience store to buy charcoal.
By that time, I had graduated from college and was living out-of-state.
I think about whatever is going on in my life at the time, and how trivial it all suddenly seems.
When I think about him today, I wish I had gotten to know him better.
We never played tennis, and we never saw each other over that summer.
And because of Brian, I try to make an effort to do something about it, albeit sometimes with more gusto than others.
