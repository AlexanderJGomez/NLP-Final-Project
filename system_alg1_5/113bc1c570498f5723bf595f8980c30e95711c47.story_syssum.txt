"If you're trying to do commerce between Portland (Oregon) and Seattle, there is no way right now," said Bob Calkins, a spokesman for the Washington State Emergency Operations Center in Camp Murray, near Tacoma.
"The problem is, the one real good detour is just as flooded," Calkins said.
Across the state, a number of rivers had crested, but flooded roads remained hazardous.
"It's a situation you don't realize you are going to be in; it's always someone else," she said from the shelter at the Sunrise Baptist Church in Puyallup, a few miles east of Tacoma.
"It just drizzles every day, or so it seems, whereas in Miami, when it rains, it's a bellywasher," Calkins said.
"The larger issue is, as people go to their homes, they may be walking through floodwater that is contaminated by sewage," he said.
