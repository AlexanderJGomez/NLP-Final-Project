Intuit, which also makes TurboTax, maintains the two personal-finance tools in tandem, and recent updates to each, such as the free Mint iPad app that launched on Wednesday or the major new version of Quicken that hit stores last month, are indicative of how different their audiences think about their money.
On the other hand, Mint's website and applications, which can all provide access to a single account's information stored on Intuit's servers, are free with ads for cards, banks and insurance companies tailored to a user's spending habits sprinkled throughout.
"Changing people's habits is hard," Intuit co-founder Scott Cook said in a recent interview.
About a third of Quicken customers buy a new version every year, and another third upgrade every three years, said Eddy Wu, an Intuit senior product manager.
"Most people don't like to do all that manual data entry," Wu said.
Intuit is mulling how it might converge the two apps, or at least make them more interoperable, but it has no immediate plans to build that bridge, he said.
