Yaounde, Cameroon (CNN) -- Heavily armed poachers recently killed nearly 40 endangered forest elephants for their ivory in two national parks, officials in Cameroon said Tuesday, the latest in a string of slaughters of the animals in Central Africa.
Evidence indicates that a horseback-riding band of about 300 poachers from Sudan was behind the slaughter, officials said.
The governments of three Central African nations -- Cameroon, the Central African Republic and Chad -- announced Saturday they would muster as many as 1,000 soldiers for joint military operations to protect the region's last remaining savanna elephants, as the Sudanese poachers are still active in the region.
On the night of March 14 to 15, poachers slaughtered killed at least 89 elephants in southern Chad, WWF said.
Robert Jackson, the U.S. ambassador to Cameroon, said he was pleased with the meeting.
