When the man balked at paying, Bulger replied, "We have a business besides bookmaking."
O'Brien said he was an "independent" bookmaker, or unaffiliated with a crime organization, when Bulger summoned him to a meeting to discuss joining the Bulger group.
If you want to be in business, you have to be with us."
The monthly payment went in excess of $2,000, O'Brien said, and was sometimes higher because Bulger and partner Steven "The Rifleman" Flemmi would charge random "taxes" if, for example, one of O'Brien's workers found himself at the end of a government wiretap.
Several years later, he said, he was summoned to a meeting with Flemmi amid rumblings that Bulger associates -- including a "father-and-daughter team" -- were starting to cooperate with the government.
"The FBI put a higher priority protecting their informants" than they did protecting "public safety," Foley said.
Bulger was in hiding for 16 years before he was captured in Santa Monica, California, two years ago, living under a false name with his girlfriend in an apartment in the oceanside city.
