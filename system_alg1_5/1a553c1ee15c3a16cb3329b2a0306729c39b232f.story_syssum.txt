The two cheetahs had been separated from their mother so they could be vaccinated, weighed and swabbed for DNA.
"A cheetah female can't produce enough milk for just one cub because a single cub won't stimulate mom enough to keep producing milk," cheetah biologist Adrienne Crosier said.
When another singleton female cub was born to 9-year-old Zazi, the zoo biologists decided to sneak the first cub in with the second and see if Zazi would raise both as her own.
"She picked him up, she immediately started grooming him.
"She's getting a little worked up," Padilla said.
"Last year, we had our new young male coalition, and we wanted to literally teach them about female cheetahs and how to breed because they were very young and inexperienced," Crosier said.
They'll stay with Zazi for another year, but they will likely get a breeding recommendation and go to other breeding centers.
