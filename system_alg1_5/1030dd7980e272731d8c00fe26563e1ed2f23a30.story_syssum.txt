Conviction on the misdemeanor charge of driving without a license is punishable by up to a year in jail, said her lawyer, Jerome Lee.
On Thursday, Lee said that she had recently obtained a learner's permit, which he said was grounds to dismiss the misdemeanor charge under Georgia law.
In May, she was released, and her deportation was deferred for a year, which will allow her to finish her studies.
On Thursday, Lee said that other than completing college, his client's plans for the future are unclear.
