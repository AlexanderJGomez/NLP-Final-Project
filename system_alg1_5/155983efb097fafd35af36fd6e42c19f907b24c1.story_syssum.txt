In December 2006, Ratley carried his 2-week-old son, Aiden, and his wife, Effie Ratley, 29, from the flames as fire engulfed their Bryceville, Florida, trailer.
On Tuesday, a Nassau County Court jury in Yulee, Florida, said he should spend the rest of his life in prison for the crime.
During the trial, Ratley said he had nothing to do with the slaying.
"He has always been a caring, nonviolent person," said his mother, Cindy Ratley.
Witnesses for Ratley tried in court to give a picture of the son, grandson, and friend they said he had always been, with the defense calling the murder a "single, horrible snapshot" in Ratley's overwhelmingly positive life.
This shows his best character," de la Rionda said, showing the jurors gruesome photos of Effie Ratley's injuries.
Effie Ratley, who enjoyed listening to '50s music and watching black-and-white movies, was thrilled when she and her husband had their baby, her family told the court Tuesday.
"He didn't know if he could love her enough, because he only wanted the best for her," Donna Stanley said, talking about her nephew.
"She's the first thing I think about in the morning when I wake up," he said, his voice wavering.
from Michael Ratley's family inside court, the gravity of the situation seemed to hit during a short recess.
Michael Ratley looked over, saw his grandmother upset, and he, too, began to cry.
