Few doubt that Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, CDU, will win most votes.
That is not exactly a large majority, but it's two percent more than the left of center parties, the Social Democrats, the Green Party, and the left wing "Die Linke," who would reach about 46 percent if polls are accurate.
I think they want a conservative government and they will vote to put us in power," he said.
"After the economic crisis we will see a social crisis," says Henrik Enderlein an economics professor at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin.
The Social Democratic contender running against Merkel, Frank Walter Steinmeier, however, has all but given up any hopes of winning.
Now Steinmeier is trying to lead the Social Democrats out of the impasse and he realizes his real chance to stay in power would be as the junior partner to Merkel.
"The atmosphere was very good and that is very important for such a coalition."
"This election seems kind of lame," one young summed it up when I asked him near Berlin's technical university.
That did not make for an exciting campaign, but it could make for a good continuation of the grand coalition.
