Organizers of the Volvo Ocean Race -- the prestigious round-the-world sailing competition -- seem to think so, and are gearing up for the first all-female team in over a decade.
It's big waves, icebergs, it's incredible team spirit.
"It's very physical and it's definitely become a lot more physical over the years --the sails are getting bigger, the boats are going faster," three-time race winner, Brad Jackson, told CNN.
Among them is Briton Sam Davies, who in 2008 finished fourth in the Vendee Globe -- a non-stop, solo circumnavigation renowned as the toughest sailing competition on the planet.
"The VendÄ—e Globe is my project, I'm my own boss and I do everything on the boat.
But her three-person-crew, who had won a world title in their Olympic build up, did not deliver, instead finishing sixth.
A female team in this race should be the norm, not something unusual."
