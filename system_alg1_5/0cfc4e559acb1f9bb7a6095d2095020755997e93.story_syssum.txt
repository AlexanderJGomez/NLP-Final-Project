Today, as the Egyptian state shudders, with millions taking to the streets infuriated with a government that is taking the country down a path they do not trust, and as Syrians continue to slaughter each other, with death toll approaching 100,000, there is no side in the conflicts that feels warmly toward America.
Granted, the uprisings also targeted strong American allies, such as Egypt's now-deposed president, Hosni Mubarak.
The choices, in fairness, were not easy.
Instead, in pursuit of stability, the U.S. held its tongue.
The Obama administration has been so timid, so eager to stay out of the fray, that a few weeks before the verdict against the pro-democracy activists, Secretary of State John Kerry passed up the opportunity to take a stand for the workers, and for democracy, by quietly waiving the human rights preconditions of U.S. aid to Egypt and thus allowing $1.3 billion in aid to go forward.
But in the case of the Arab uprisings, America's ideals and interests overlap.
