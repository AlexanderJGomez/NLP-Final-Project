When I was six years old, he showed me how to complete the task Marine Corps-style and would inspect my work on a daily basis.
How important it is to have fun.

Thanks to my father, I don't let self-doubt keep me from achieving my goals.
He showed me how to use power tools, climb on the roof to install a radio antenna, and lift a trailer onto a hitch.
My father says, "If you want something done, ask a busy person to do it."
In my own life, I've discovered that I am more productive when I have more going on.
Because of this sound guidance, my marriage is thriving.
After all, they deserve my full attention.

To avoid the blues, my dad said, you should always have something to look forward to.
