(CNN) -- Decked out in voluminous Victorian-style dresses, complete with horn-shaped headgear, the Herero ladies of Namibia have held on tight to a piece of 19th century history.
"The Herero women's long dress has become a symbol of Herero tradition for Herero, tourists, scholars and other Namibians," she added.
He explains that the style of dress has become an important part of the Herero women's identity.
"Instead of the Herero being topless and barely covered, which would offend the modest attitudes of Victorians at the time, they wanted them to be covered up," he added.
"This is in part assimilation to European culture, and also in part appropriation, a coming-to-terms with, and overcoming of history and the colonial experience," he said.
