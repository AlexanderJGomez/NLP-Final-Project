When iCloud drops this fall, Apple will join Amazon.com and Google, two major players that have already begun rolling out storage services.
For music, Apple has the incumbent's advantage.
"It takes minutes, not weeks," Jobs said.
Apple, instead, uses a "scan-and-match" procedure, finding which of your songs are also sold in the iTunes Store and giving you the keys to access those.
Google does not have a music store.
So we're making it free," Jobs said.
Amazon's Cloud Drive can also store photos and video, but those files do count against a user's total.
Apple has integrated iCloud tightly into the mobile and computer systems it makes, starting with Mac OS X Lion and iOS 5, which debut next month and in the fall, respectively.
Apple will also have websites for accessing e-mail, calendar and other features, as well as allowing Windows-PC users to sync photos to a folder.
Shortly after the launch of the now three-year-old Web service, Jobs assembled the team who developed it and told them: "You've tarnished Apple's reputation," according to a story in Fortune magazine.
"If you don't think we're serious about this, you're wrong," he said, before transitioning to pictures of a massive facility Apple built in Maiden, North Carolina: "This is our third data center that we just completed.
It's rather large."
