London (CNN) -- Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, the son of Libya's deposed leader Moammar Gadhafi, could go on trial "within weeks or months," the country's interior minister said Sunday.
"He may have a lawyer if he asks for a lawyer," the interior minister said.
"There is no comparison whatsoever between the situation prevailing under Moammar Gadhafi and the situation now," he said.
"It was a battlefield, he was carrying weapons, there were fighters around, no one was controlling those fighters," Abdilal said.
