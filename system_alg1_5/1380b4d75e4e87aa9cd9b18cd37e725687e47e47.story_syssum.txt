The congressman had a conversation with the official, described as a whistle-blower, about the affair and national security concerns involved in the matter, he said.
Clapper then advised Petraeus to resign, the official said.
During the investigation, other communications surfaced between Petraeus and Broadwell, a married mother of two, according to the official.
The official could not say if the investigation is still ongoing.
"If there was an official investigation that was looking, at least in part, at information that was compromising the CIA director, then I think there's a solid argument to say that the committee leadership should have been notified to at least some level of detail."
"It just doesn't add up," Rep. Peter King, R-New York, told CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley on Sunday.
"Director Petraeus' frank and forthright letter of resignation stands on its own," said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic.
Such behavior is unacceptable, both as a husband and as the leader of an organization such as ours," Petraeus said in a letter to colleagues, explaining his decision to step down.
Petraeus, 60, and his wife, Holly, live in Virginia.
