Woods, 33, struck a fire hydrant and a tree with his 2009 Cadillac SUV in his luxury neighborhood near Windermere, Florida, early Friday, police said.
"Elin was talking to him," he said, referring to Woods' wife, Elin Nordegren.
After that, she "wasn't very verbal," Adams said.
"Maybe if you'd have bitten your lip, or something like that," he said.
"He was actually snoring," he said.
The police report called his injuries serious, but a spokesman for Woods described them as minor.
