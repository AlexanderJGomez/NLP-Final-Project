(AOL Autos)  -- Recently, Consumer Reports magazine issued its list of best and worst used cars, and divvied them up by price range.
The 328i is another sleek, finely-tuned and beautifully-designed driving machine, offering sporty performance and Euro-style luxury.
Performance power, therefore, is much higher than the other 3-Series editions.
It came as a coupe or convertible, and churned out 333 horses.
During the last used-model year, '07, the primary distinction between the two was that the M35 was powered by a V6 that kicked out 275 horses, while the M45 muscled up to a 325-hp V8.
Lexus has placed No 1 in the JD Power Dependability Survey every year for the last 12 years - until '07, when another carmaker, Buick, finally tied them for first.
And by the latest recommended used-model year, the '07, you could choose among various styles and engine sizes, including the Carrera, with its 3.6-L 325-hp flat-six plant; the Carrera S and S Cabriolet, with the 3.8-L 355 hp V6; the 911 Turbo, with twin-turbocharged 480 hp six-cylinder engine; and the GT3 track model, powered by a high-revving 415-hp six-cylinder engine.
