Julie K. Schenecker, 50, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the shooting deaths Friday of her 16-year-old daughter, Calyx, and her 13-year-old son, Beau.
King High School, which Calyx attended, and Liberty Middle School, where Beau was a student, are sponsoring the service at First Baptist Church of Temple Terrace in Tampa, the church said.
He is devoted first and foremost to honoring the lives and memory of his beautiful children, Calyx and Beau," the statement said.
Also indicated in the search warrant -- both inside and outside the house -- were cigarette butts, note pads, undisclosed medication and paperwork.
She had been shot twice in the head, police said.
"There are definitely indications that she planned this," McElroy said.
