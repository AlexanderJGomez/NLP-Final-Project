What's more, I certainly never thought that, 50 years after a march for voting rights went from Selma to Montgomery, that the first couple to get married there would be a courageous African-American couple, Tori Sisson and Shant√© Wolfe, who camped out overnight on the sidewalk outside the courthouse just to be the first in line.
Even today, more than half the counties in the state are refusing to issue licenses to gay couples.
In just a few months, the U.S. Supreme Court could end this chapter of our history once and for all.
But, after Bush v. Gore, Citizens United, and Shelby v. Holder, the case gutting the 1965 Voting Rights Act in 2013, sometimes it seems like the voices of the American people don't get heard by those nine Justices.
Together, they've launched the People's Brief.
The People's Brief will serve as a poignant reminder to the Court that gay marriage is an issue that impacts the lives of both gay and straight, of those who are the family, friends, and loved ones of gay people, and of those who simply value a society where the rights of all people are treated with equal dignity.
In fact, I think it's long overdue.
It's time to put your name on the right side of history.
