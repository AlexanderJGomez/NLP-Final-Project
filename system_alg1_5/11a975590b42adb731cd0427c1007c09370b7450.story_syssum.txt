Instead of just finding the closest thing to Reader, maybe it's time to change how you consume all that news.
Google Takeout bundles up your feeds, folders, followers and other data into a zip file that you can use later with other services.
The best bets are Feedly, The Old Reader, NewsBlur, Aol Reader and NetVibes.
Twitter is a killer news source.
It is decent for finding recommended links, but the posts and banter are more personal, happy and less about the outside world.
The RSS fire hose of news can be overwhelming for many people.
Flipboard, Prismatic, Pulse and Zite (which is owned by CNN) are all popular options.
Save the things you want to dig into later, even offline, with tools such as Instapaper, Pocket or Readability.
There is also Google News, which looks at all the news sources and arranges the breaking stories by popularity, highlighting the in-depth, opinion and featured stories on the topic.
For example, some go directly to their bookmarked must-read sites in the morning, keep up on current news with Twitter during the day and soak in longer articles on commutes with tools such as Instapaper.
Google Reader was a great tool that will be missed, but its death is an opportunity to try new things and play with different apps, sites and tools for reading news online.
