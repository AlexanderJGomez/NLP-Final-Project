But, family members say, Nehemiah Griego is no monster.
"Whether it was a mental breakdown or some deeper undiagnosed psychological issue, we can't be sure yet," his uncle, former New Mexico state Sen. Eric Griego, said.
What we do agree on is that those who wish to score political points should not use a confused, misguided, 15-year-old boy to make their case," the family statement said.
That he told investigators he was frustrated with his mother.
The teen's demeanor, as he shared all this, was "stern, very unemotional," Houston said.
"So Nehemiah picked up his mother's head to show his brother her bloody face," the affidavit said.
After the slayings, Griego "spent the majority of the day with his girlfriend," Houston said.
He even sent his girlfriend a picture of his slain mother, Houston said.
His church, Calvary Albuquerque, is scheduled to hold a prayer vigil Wednesday at 7 p.m. for the Griego family.
"This is beyond any human reasoning or understanding at this time," the sheriff said.
