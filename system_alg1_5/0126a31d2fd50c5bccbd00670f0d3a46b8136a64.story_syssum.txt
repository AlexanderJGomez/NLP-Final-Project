Fernando Alonso finished fourth for Ferrari, with Mark Webber in his Red Bull in fifth place.
The 23-year-old Vettel, who was claiming his 11th victory in just his 63rd grand prix, told the official Formula One website: "I'm very pleased, it was a very good weekend and I had a very nice car to sit in this afternoon.
We didn't know where we were coming into the season, but in practice and qualifying we were good.
However, it proved a disastrous day for the Mercedes pair of Michael Schumacher and Nico Rosberg, who had both retired by the 22nd lap of the race.
