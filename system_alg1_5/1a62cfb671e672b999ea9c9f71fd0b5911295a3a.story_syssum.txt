The French-Algerian man, who was sought by French police, was detained by Malian officers in northern Mali, Le Drian said.
We were not mistaken, this is the case," Le Drian said.
French involvement in the conflict began on January 11, the day after militants said they had seized the city of Konna, east of Diabaly in central Mali, and were poised to advance south toward Bamako, the capital.
France will begin to reduce its troop levels in Mali next month in an effort to have West African forces, with the support of the United Nations, take over and maintain security in the country, Fabius said.
