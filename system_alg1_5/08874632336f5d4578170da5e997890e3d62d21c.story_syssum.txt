Karen Lewis, union president, said the rank and file will vote in "the next couple of weeks."
"Well, I think it is the best deal we could get at this moment in time," Lewis said before the meeting.
"In this contract we gave our children a seat at the table," he said at a news conference.
"The mayor had an education agenda he wanted to ram down our throats," she said.
David Vitale, chairman of the school board, said the new deal will transform the school system to the benefit of teachers and students.
"You need to know that our engagement was totally professional, and while it was extremely hard work, the work was done with purpose and with intent, I believe, the get our kids back to school," he said.
This contract calls for longer school days for elementary and high school-age students, 10 more "instructional days" each school year and a single calendar for the entire school system, as opposed to the two schedules now in place, depending on the school.
Union members would no longer be compensated for unused personal days, health insurance contribution rates would be frozen, and the "enhanced pension program" would be eliminated.
"With this agreement now we have the foundation for transformation," he said.
