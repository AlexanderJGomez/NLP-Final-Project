(CNN) -- Coming home from Asia, Barack Obama is obviously going through another rough patch in his presidency.
After that, Washington becomes mired in midterm politicking, and in your third year, people start looking over your shoulder at who is coming next.
He is one of the brightest men ever to occupy the office, and yet his learning curve has been among the flattest.
On the tail end of his Asia trip, Obama told the press that in foreign policy, he thinks a president hits mostly singles and doubles and an occasional home run.
The administration would vigorously disagree, but just how much success can it genuinely claim in Syria, Egypt, Libya or even Iraq?
To its credit, the administration has aggressively pursued the deal but to little avail.
Most Americans still want him to succeed, but when television executives put him on the air, audiences often melt away.
America needs a strong, effective president year in, year out, to help propel us forward.
But in the twinkle of an eye, we have gone from being indispensable to indisposed.
But mostly, the Obama team probably has to be patient.
And for all his troubles, the President retains enormous powers and public good will.
