(Tribune Media Services) -- If you think being a secret agent is all just one giant adrenaline rush, think again.
Phew.
I've brought along two sixth-graders from Stamford, Connecticut -- my cousin's son, Max Weinberg, and his friend, Miles Singer -- to see if I'm up to the challenge.
The Palomar Hotel, a Kimpton Hotel, (www.hotelpalomar-dc.com), just a short walk from DuPont Circle and Rock Creek Park) proved an ideal choice for my "mission" too.
"This makes me feel like a king," Miles declares, jumping on the bed.
The boys, of course, would have preferred to never leave the hotel but I promise we can skip all the "boring stuff"" -- like the Capitol Building, the Supreme Court, all art museums and even the White House.
At Jaleo, (www.jaleo.com), they sampled tapas for the first time -- but passed on the octopus and squid and reveled at being treated like grown-ups at the trendy D.C. Coast (www.dccoast.com).
Be prepared.
Me too.
