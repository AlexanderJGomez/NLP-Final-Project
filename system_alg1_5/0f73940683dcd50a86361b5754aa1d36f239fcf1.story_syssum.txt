Current systems of education are based on the manufacturing principles of linearity, conformity and standardization.
Education is a personal process.
The first is standardizing.
These methods do not prescribe what's on the menu, when restaurants should open, or how they should be decorated.
They can be French, Mexican, Italian, Indian, American or anything else.
This is not a theory.
Understanding those conditions is the real key to transforming education for all our children.
