Shortly after Guzman Salazar's arrest in October, a U.S. federal official told CNN that she was the daughter of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, who authorities have said heads Mexico's Sinaloa cartel.
Another attorney for Guzman Salazar, Jan Ronis, said he watched her cross into Tijuana, Mexico, on Tuesday, but he declined to comment on where she headed after that.
"All these facts were part of the public record that she wanted to come and have her baby here," he said.
"When she's back in Mexico, hopefully she can go on living her normal private life," Valencia said.
The U.S. Treasury Department has declared him the most influential trafficker in the world, and Mexican authorities have been on his tail since his 2001 escape from a Mexican prison in a laundry cart.
