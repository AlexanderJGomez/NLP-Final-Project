Unbelievably, such a policy means that those unlocking their phones could face up to five years in jail and a $500,000 fine.
This is why the trade association representing more than 100 wireless carriers across the country (Competitive Carriers Association), including T-Mobile and Sprint, is strongly in favor of unlocking.
In fact, we believe the same principle should also apply to tablets, which are increasingly similar to smartphones.
And if you have paid for your mobile device, and aren't bound by a service agreement or other obligation, you should be able to use it on another network.
There is a groundswell of momentum on this issue.
Unfortunately, legislation by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, and Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, does this very thing, but I have confidence that in the coming weeks it can be improved to fix the problem.
Currently, there is an exception for personal jailbreaking (allowing individuals to install unapproved applications by altering the phone's operating system), but developing, selling, trafficking or discussing the underlying technology is still illegal and there are no personal exceptions for tablets or other devices.
This technology should be made permanently lawful for personal use, creation, trafficking and selling.
There is a current exception, but it is narrow and unclear, and this has a chilling effect upon a lot of legitimate research -- some of the research would actually help protect intellectual property by helping to make digital rights management software stronger.
Congress must act to legalize cellphone unlocking substantively, but then it must legalize other technologies that have been banned without explanation.
