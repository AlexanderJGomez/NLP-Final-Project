"Preliminary police investigations indicate a suicide," Wittke said.
Enke captained Hannover 96, a team who currently lie tenth in Germany's Bundesliga top division,  and had been capped by his national side eight times after making his debut aged 29.
"We are in a state of shock," said team manager Oliver Bierhoff in a statement from the German Football Federation.
"It's been well documented that he had a tough time," Honigstein said.
"I don't know why and how this happened," said Martin Kind, the chairman of Hannover 96.
"He was unstable," said Mr Kind.
