Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Renault-Nissan, told CNN's Max Foster that the company is targeting a "totally autonomous" car by 2020.
"People on average in the world spend two hours in a car per day," he said.
"They are the number one most sold car in Europe, more than 240,000, presenting more than 30% of sales," Ghosn said.
And the CEO, who heads the longstanding partnership between French Renault and Japanese Nissan, said the "systematic decline" of the European car market is now over.
