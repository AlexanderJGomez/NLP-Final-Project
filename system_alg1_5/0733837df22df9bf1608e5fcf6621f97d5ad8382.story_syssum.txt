The visitors had threatened to become the first team to win at the Santiago Bernabeu this season, leading 2-1 after 18 minutes, but Ronaldo completed his treble to put Real ahead and then set up a clinching goal by substitute Kaka to keep his side two points behind leaders Barcelona.
It had been a long time since I scored, so it was very important to me.
Ronaldo has now scored 22 goals in 18 La Liga games this season, and 31 overall.
Ronaldo struck a vital blow when he equalized in the first minute of time added on, stealing a header from Xabi Alonso's free-kick.
There was no doubt about the fourth goal on 82 minutes, as Ronaldo slipped a clever pass into the box and Kaka poked the ball past Lopez.
Getafe could only draw 0-0 at Osasuna, who moved five points clear of the bottom three.
