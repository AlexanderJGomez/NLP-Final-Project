After months of failed negotiations, key House and Senate committees passed proposals Thursday that were relatively close in scope and content.
The Senate committee adopted a House idea, including something called pension smoothing, which allows employers to set aside less money for long-term pension funding.
"Colleagues, I want it understood that (pushing for a longer-term solution) was my position at the beginning of the negotiations," the Oregon Democrat said to his committee.
"While I won't say I've gotten everything I wanted," ranking Republican Orrin Hatch admitted, " I will say I think we've reached a deal that can satisfy both Democrats and Republicans."
"I commend Chairman Wyden and Senator Hatch for putting together a bill that provides roughly $11 billion, as we did," wrote House Ways & Means Chairman Dave Camp in a statement.
But the politics are a problem.
"Our message to Congress is simple: your job isn't close to being done," Ruane concluded.
