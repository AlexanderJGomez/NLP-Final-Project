Wages remain sluggish.
Most part-time employees are doing low-wage work.
Not surprisingly, such haphazard scheduling wreaks havoc with low-wage workers.
Women comprise over two-thirds of the nearly 20 million workers in low-wage jobs like home health care, fast food work, and cash services.
Similarly, a large proportion of minorities work low-wage jobs.
Within this same context, 18% of whites said they could.
Unions, for example, have provided little protection against just-in-time scheduling because of their nascent role in the service economy.
Last summer, The Schedules that Work Act was introduced in Congress.
According to the National Women's Law Center, the bill would provide workers the right to request and receive predictable work schedules, receive compensation for sudden scheduling changes, and not fear retaliation if they request scheduling accommodations from their boss.
While Washington stalls, it's everyday Americans who are hurt.
Even with the weaker-than-expected jobs report we know our overall economy is improving, yet income-inequality is deepening.
Congress must endorse a recovery that's inclusive, livable, and one that enables every family to balance competing obligations.
