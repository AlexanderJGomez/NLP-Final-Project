"Roberto did a great job, it's not easy to win the title after 43, 44 years," Pellegrini said.
Like Jose Mourinho's return to Chelsea, Pellegrini was widely expected to join Manchester City following the departure of Mancini.
"We have been greatly impressed throughout the selection process by his philosophy, his attitude, and his commitment to the long-term development of Manchester City," City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak said.
Pellegrini led Villarreal to a second-place finish in La Liga and the Champions League semifinals, while in his one season with Real Madrid, in 2009-2010, it amassed a then club record 96 points without winning any trophies.
Malaga, meanwhile, announced Friday that former Real Madrid manager Bernd Schuster would replace Pellegrini at La Rosaleda.
