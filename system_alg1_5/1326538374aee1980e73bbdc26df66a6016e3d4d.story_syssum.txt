"The Security Council deplores the attack," the 15-member council said in what is known as a presidential statement.
"This statement is notable and it is clear," Rice said after its approval at a Friday morning session.
Australia, Britain, the United States, Sweden and South Korea provided experts for the inquiry.
A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of North Korea, officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, called the presidential statement "devoid of any proper judgment," according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency.
"From the beginning of the incident we have made our position very clear that this incident has nothing to do with us," he said.
It welcomed the "restraint shown" by South Korea in the handling of the Cheonan incident, and urged the resumption of dialogue and negotiations between the strained neighbors.
