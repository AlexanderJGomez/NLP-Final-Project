The sharp reaction from Panetta, a rare public dressing down of the head of a country, came a day after Karzai accused the United States and NATO of attacking insurgents in Afghanistan rather than targeting the support they receive from Pakistan.
"I asked the U.S. government to equip our air force with weapons, intelligence and transport planes -- we still haven't received a response from them," he said.
Karzai laid some of the blame on the United States for the shelling of Afghanistan's eastern border provinces by insurgents inside Pakistan, saying his forces were not sufficiently equipped to respond and the United States should have stepped up.
Panetta said the United States remains committed to timetable to withdraw American combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014.
