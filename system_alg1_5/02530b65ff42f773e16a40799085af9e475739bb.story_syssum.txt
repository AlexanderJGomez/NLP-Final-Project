If you're flying for the holiday, expect lots of company and few airfare deals.
Those who will be flying over the holiday will pay $376 on average for a domestic ticket, or about 4% more than at the same time last year, according to Travelocity.
"Don't delay: Prices are not going to go down between now and Thanksgiving," Klurman said.
If you're flying with someone for Thanksgiving, the chances of sitting together on the plane are also higher if you book early, Hobica said.
Be especially flexible if you're in a major city like New York, where there are several airports in the area, Klurman said.
In general, avoid a Sunday return, Travelocity advised.
If you miss a connection, Travelocity warns that with planes booked solid, it could be a while before your airline is able to book you on another flight.
It may be worth paying this extra charge during peak travel times, like Thanksgiving, to make the journey saner, Hobica said.
"If you only fly once a year, sometimes the day passes are worthwhile, especially if your flight is delayed," Hobica said.
