"This is the first time we had to close off air filtered by the facility to the outside," Energy Department spokesman Gregory Sahd told CNN.
The radiation was first detected at 11:30 p.m., according to Sahd.
"No one was underground when the alarm went off," Sahd said.
Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich said in a statement Saturday that they remain in contact with Energy Department officials.
