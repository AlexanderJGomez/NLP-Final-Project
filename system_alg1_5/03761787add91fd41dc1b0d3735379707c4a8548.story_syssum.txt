(CNN)Valentine's Day is big currency in China, a nation obsessed with love, romance and dating.
Every weekend in China a strange, albeit charming, ritual takes place -- the parents of China's singles frequent their local park in order to match make on behalf of their children.
The hukou, as it is known, is tied to a host of social benefits.
With it, your life is easy.
When not found in a park trying to "pimp" people out, they will be gossiping with neighbors, friends and co-workers about said person's single status and how to change it.
They might join you on a date.
Alpha males, by contrast, make their way to the city.
If they have a PhD, they're not even regarded as a true woman.
The nation's singles can peruse a buffet of sites, from those that promise to find you the one, to others that are more wired towards one-nighters (although the trend is much more towards the former than the latter).
Do not despair -- there are now love gurus in China, who, taking their cue from American TV show "The Game," will offer men advice on how to successfully chat up women.
Other jewels include dressing better and spending less on the object of your affection (yes, you read that correctly).
