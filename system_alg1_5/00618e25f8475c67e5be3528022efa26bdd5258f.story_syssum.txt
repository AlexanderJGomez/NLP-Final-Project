The scene switches to Voteman, a muscle-bound, stubble-chinned superhero, answering a call asking him to persuade voters to have their say in the upcoming European Parliament elections.
Mogens Lykketoft, speaker of the Danish Parliament, said in a statement on his Facebook page that many people had perceived the cartoon as "more serious and offensive than it was intended, and see it as talking down to the youth.
The cartoon tells the story of how Voteman, as a young man, once forgot to vote in European Parliament elections.
So if you're not going to vote, don't try to run, don't try to hide, because he will find you.
Denmark's turnout for the last European elections in 2009 was close to 60%, well above the European average of 43%.
