He was transported to a nearby hospital, but "unfortunately could not be saved," Keenum said.
The school's emergency response procedures "were executed quickly and effectively last night," Keenum said Sunday.
"Throughout the night and into this morning, we have kept the campus informed of developments through our Maroon Alert emergency notification system," the president said.
"This is the first time in our school's history that such a tragic incident has occurred, involving a student being shot on campus," he said.
The school, located on 4,200 acres about 125 northeast of Jackson, had a 2011 fall enrollment of 20,424.
