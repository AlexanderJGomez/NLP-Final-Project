And you know, more or less, how much you want to spend -- or how much you can afford.
The list of "extras" offered by most dealers, may include paint sealant, fabric protection/leather care, extended warranties, extended 'one price' service contracts, rust/underbody coatings and anti-theft systems, to mention a few.
"I think that most paint jobs on cars are pretty good these days, so in most cases you probably don't need that anymore," said Bennett, who offered one caveat.
Also, if you get a chip or a ding, get it fixed so the rust doesn't get a chance to set in and spread."
"Also, look at exclusions in the plan," advises Bennett.

"But even if you live in a safe, low-crime district, your car can still be stolen from a busy downtown street or parking garage," he notes.
"And these days, those manufacturers warranties are three or five years, sometimes longer.
Some warranties offer transferable policies, which let you "sell" the warranty along with the vehicle.
"That's a pretty good warranty, so if you plan on only keeping your vehicle for five years or less, the extended warranty is probably money you don't need to spend."
