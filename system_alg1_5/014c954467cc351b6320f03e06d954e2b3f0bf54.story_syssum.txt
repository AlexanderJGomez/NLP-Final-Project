The falling debris forced the closure of the bridge and snarled traffic between Oakland and San Francisco, California, as commuters look for alternate ways to get to and from the cities.
"The bridge has been inspected, and it is now safer than when we closed it," Randell Iwasaki, the director of the California Department of Transportation, said at the time.
"It failed," he said.
But even more important is that our state and local governments use that money to deliver projects that quickly meet the needs of our communities," John Horsley, the group's executive director, said in a recent report.
"I have seen some lip service, but I have not seen a lot of momentum and action," said William Ibbs, a professor of civil engineering at UC-Berkeley.
"In the engineering community, we knew these things many years ago, and there were requests for money, which wasn't coming," Barzegar said.
"If we don't start making substantial progress in five years, we will have more collapses," Ibbs said.
Part of the bridge, the West Span, is a suspension bridge.
