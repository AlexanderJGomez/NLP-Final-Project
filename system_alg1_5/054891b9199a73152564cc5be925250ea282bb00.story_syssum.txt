Rozita Swinton, 33, of Colorado Springs, Colorado, was arrested this month on a charge of making a false report to police.
The charge relates to an incident in February, but the Texas Rangers have said she is a person of interest in connection with the ranch calls.
However, it has been used in other cases linked to Swinton, the document says.
The woman identifying herself as Sarah Barlow also called a battered women's shelter in Snohomish County, Washington, using another phone number, the affidavit says.
During that conversation, the affidavit says, the woman used terminology common to the FLDS, referring to her "sister wives," for instance.
Meanwhile, on Tuesday evening, laboratory workers at San Angelo Coliseum completed taking DNA samples from mothers and children, said Janice Rolfe, a spokeswoman for the state attorney general's office.
Judge Barbara Walther, who last week ordered the DNA testing of the children and ordered that they remain in state custody, signed an order this week authorizing the children's move to foster care, officials said.
The remaining children, 2 to 18 years old, will be split up into available homes.
The site, captivefldschildren.com, contains photos and videos taken inside the ranch during the raid.
