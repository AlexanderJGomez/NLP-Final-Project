"The wreckage has been found and there are no survivors," Kibaki said, according to the government Web site.
The president identified the two others killed as Kenneth Kiprono Bett, who worked for Kones, and the pilot.
"This is terrible, and utterly unimaginable news for us in Kenya, where there has been so much suffering recently," Lone said.
Under the agreement, Kibaki retained the presidency while ODM leader Raila Odinga became prime minister.
