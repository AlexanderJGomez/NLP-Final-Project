Some say this will result in a two-tier European Union.
This leaves Britain, under Prime Minister David Cameron, alone among the 27 European Union nations to point-blank refuse to sign.
That said, Britain's prior refusal to join the euro and pervading "euro scepticism" could just mean the new treaty reinforces the status quo, albeit with frostier relations.
Ideally, everyone will stick to the new rules, and those countries that require emergency bailouts will be granted them, allowing the European Union to slowly put its debt problems behind it.
This could lead to an evaporation of investor confidence, the collapse of debt-exposed banks, an emptying of government coffers, a nosedive by share markets, and bleak prospects for the euro.
