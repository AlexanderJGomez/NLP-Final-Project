"He opened the back door and he just fall down the plane," the pilot said, according to a recording of the conversation.
A police spokeswoman said it was unclear whether Nales accidentally fell out of the plane or deliberately jumped.
The pilot first told air traffic controllers that a door was open on the plane, then added that a passenger had fallen out.
