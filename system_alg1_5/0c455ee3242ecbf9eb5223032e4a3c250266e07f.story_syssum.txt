Recruits were allowed to enlist after having been convicted of crimes including assault, burglary, drug possession and making terrorist threats.
"There was a rapid rise in 2007 in the number of waivers the Army and Marine Corps granted to recruits convicted of serious felonies," Waxman said in a letter Monday to David Chu, the under-secretary of defense for personnel and readiness.
It also granted waivers to 43 recruits convicted of aggravated assault that year, up from 33 a year before; and to 130 people convicted of possession of drugs other than marijuana, a rise from 71 in 2006.
It also allowed two people convicted of making terrorist or bomb threats to enlist in 2007, up from one the year before.
