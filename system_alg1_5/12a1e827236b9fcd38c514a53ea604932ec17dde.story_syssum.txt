LONDON, England (CNN) -- Playing the Nintendo Wii Fit could improve balance and help avoid falls in seniors, researchers taking part in a new study suggest.
Stewart, a commercial research manager with the NHS, said she then decided to research how to improve older people's balance.
"That's when I looked up the Wii and discovered it is very similar to the other equipment, but less expensive.
It leads to inertia and people become unstable on their feet," said Van der Zwan in a media statement.
"Everyone loves it and we noticed it has improved the physical fitness of residents who play," Rachel Todd of McArdle Care told CNN.
"I always loved sports, particularly football" Dennis told CNN.
"It really spans all ages, although my great-grandson knocked me out twice," the former bricklayer said.
