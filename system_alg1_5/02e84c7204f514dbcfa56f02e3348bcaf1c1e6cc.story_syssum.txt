Humphries, an NBA forward, accuses Kardashian, a reality TV star, of fraud by entering the marriage only to make millions of dollars with their wedding, Humphries' lawyer, Marshall Waller, told Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephen Moloney.
"Ms. Kardashian had no intention of going through with the marriage," Waller said.
"We're going to ask for every penny to be paid by Kris," she said.
Kanye West, Kardashian's current boyfriend, could be a key witness in the divorce trial, but the hip-hop star has so far evaded Humphries' efforts to subpoena him for a deposition, Waller said.
"She said he was on phone and she wouldn't accept it, so he left it," he said.
A trial date of early 2013 may be set then, he said.
