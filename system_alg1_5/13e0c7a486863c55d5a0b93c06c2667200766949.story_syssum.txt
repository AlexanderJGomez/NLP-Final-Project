(CNN) -- When "La Bamba" hit movie screens in 1987, audiences flocked to see the true story of singer Ritchie Valens, who died as a teen in an airplane crash almost three decades earlier.
Noriega, who chose the films and also co-hosts the festival, talked with CNN.com about what he hopes viewers will take away from the movie line-up.
And then, from there, we looked at what was available.
Noriega: By and large, these are films that really haven't been seen since their original release.
Or in a Western.
But it's more or less an urban outlaw type, and that persists.
But when you look at it sociologically, you see it's only working one way, and that's where I think there's a problem.
It's a multiracial, multi-ethnic group.
Noriega: We have a somewhat broader cohort of actors who are known, who are included in films, not always starring, but they get secondary roles in films and so there's in some sense more of a presence.
So it's a kind of a subtle shift.
