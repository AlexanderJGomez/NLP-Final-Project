(CNN) -- Once again, North Korea has violated an important international agreement by launching a long-range missile.
(While the regime cannot feed its people, the budget for new launching pads, rockets and a huge military has not run out.)
The United States and its allies warned North Korea to stop the launch, saying plainly, "Don't do it."
The true consequences of obtaining nuclear weapons, as North Korea has done, are becoming increasingly clear.
The North Korean dictatorship may just be the most brutal regime on earth, imprisoning, starving and isolating its people.
South Korea, a strong ally of the United States, responded with a trade embargo.
And according to a leaked report from the United Nations, North Korea has become a supplier to the nuclear programs of Iran, Syria and Burma.
For a country such as Iran, the impunity that has followed North Korea's success on the nuclear pathway is an incentive not to give up its own nuclear program.
For the rest of the world, it should serve as a reminder of how dangerous it would be to allow more nuclear weapons anywhere, but especially in the Middle East, the most unstable region on earth.
