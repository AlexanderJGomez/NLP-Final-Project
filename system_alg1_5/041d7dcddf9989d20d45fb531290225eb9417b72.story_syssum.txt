A team of individuals going by the name LulzSec, who recently managed to deface PBS.org's homepage, announced that they have broken into SonyPictures.com and compromised more than 1 million user accounts.
The attack, part of a campaign known as Sownage, was announced on Twitter and on the LulzSec website.
The scariest part of this attack isn't what was taken, but how easy it was for the LulzSec members to take it.
Still, that doesn't make up for what by all appearances is an abysmal security record.
