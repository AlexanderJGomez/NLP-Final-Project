(Oprah.com) -- It began with a sign reading "Be excellent to each other," which I printed from my computer in Gothic type and taped to my workspace.
"People treat temps like dirt," they scoffed.
Dubbing myself Robo Temp, I typed, filed, and amused my coworkers by invariably responding "I'll tell your fans" when they announced their departures for lunch.
"Hey," I heard a software engineer exclaim as I left the room.
Thanks for your excellent help."
But, for the most part, my colleagues responded positively to kindness.
When I smiled, they smiled back.
During mundane moments, I came to understand that excellence wasn't about being perfect or about being nice so people would like me.
After a few years of temping, I branched out.
Meanwhile, in my personal life, I attended to my relationships with renewed commitment.
Now, instead of a sign, I carry excellence within me as a mantra, as a presence.
