PARIS, France (CNN) -- Debris from Air France 447, which crashed en route from Brazil to France last month, killing 228 people, has arrived in France, the French air accident investigation agency BEA said Wednesday.
The search for the data and voice recorders from the plane entered a second phase last week, according to France's accident investigation agency.
Finding the recorders is of "capital importance" and "no effort must be spared in achieving this end," Air France has said.
"We want to stress that for the sake of the families, we hope that the search for the black boxes will be successful," an Air France representative told CNN.
"It is as if it fell in the Andes (mountains)," Olivier Ferrante, chief of the BEA search mission said.
