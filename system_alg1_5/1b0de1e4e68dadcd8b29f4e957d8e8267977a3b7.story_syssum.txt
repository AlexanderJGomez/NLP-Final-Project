New York (CNN)  -- Ren√©e Fleming's new album "Dark Hope" has found the light, having earned the operatic soprano a spot on the Billboard Top 200 chart for the first time.
"I've devoted my life to classical music," says Fleming, 51.
Then there's the spirit of it: the passion, the anger, the sense of social consciousness."
Rock image aside, recording "Dark Hope" was a family affair for Fleming.
"We had a wonderful time together," says Fleming.
