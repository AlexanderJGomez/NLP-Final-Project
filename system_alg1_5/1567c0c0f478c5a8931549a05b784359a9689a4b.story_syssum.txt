Below is an excerpt from HLN "Morning Express" anchor Robin Meade's new book, Morning Sunshine!
My stomach clenched.
I felt sweaty.
My heart pounded in my ears, and my face flushed.
All I heard were my own thoughts.
"Robin, are you okay?
"Yeah, please," I croaked.
"Oh, sorry about that.
I lost my breath or something."
Miraculously, by the time we came out of the video and I had to speak again, it was as if nothing had happened.
The school photographer caught the moment: there I am in the 1987 yearbook laughing with my mouth wide open, my eyes as big as saucers, and my hands behind me, having just pushed my skirt back down.
No, I was not going to be able to shrug off the "breathing problem," as I had called it, trying to minimize its impact, even though it had completely bamboozled me on the air.
My brain should have been full of concussions, I was beating myself up so much.
My stomach was still in knots.
I asked, hoping he'd say, "Oh, I sensed a little glitch on your part."
I hesitated.
I didn't know the answer.
