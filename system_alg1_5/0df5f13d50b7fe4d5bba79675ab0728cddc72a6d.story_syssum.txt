One, the subject of this obituary is a horse.
Unbeaten at two, three and four years old, Frankel's career yet seems too short for a talent that burned so bright.
The venue for the showdown between the world's two top-rated Thoroughbreds, Ascot Racecourse, is one of the most venerable courses in racing -- but is not without its own idiosyncrasies.
That performance, reminiscent of Secretariat's 31-length victory in the 1973 Belmont Stakes -- cemented Frankel's reputation as undoubtedly the greatest racehorse of the 21st century.
Frankel's jockey, Tom Queally, appeared to panic, and sent his colt off after the leader.
Notoriously undulating, the going for Saturday's race will be another test for the four-year-old, who has yet to prove himself over such soft ground.
Frankel's entire career has been played out, poignantly, against the backdrop of his trainer's battle with cancer.
Frankel himself was named after legendary American trainer Bobby Frankel, who lost his own battle with cancer in 2009, the year his namesake was born.
In a little over a year from now, the first of Frankel's foals will be taking his or her first long-limbed steps in a paddock in some corner of England.
But if they inherit just some of their sire's speed, his aggression and his indomitable will to win, a little bit of Frankel's magic will live on.
