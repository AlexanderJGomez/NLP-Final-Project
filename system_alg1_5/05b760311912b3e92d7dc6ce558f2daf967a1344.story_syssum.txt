Nah.
What??
What did he do to deserve this?
But here's the thing: Leno doesn't appeal to anyone but the viewers.
Well, he's been beating Kimmel and David Letterman even in the coveted 18-to-49 demo.
Leno has been punching back in his monologue, likening NBC suits to "snakes" and saying that the network's motto is "The Biggest Loser."
And indeed, Jimmy Fallon makes sense as Leno's eventual heir.
Fallon's a young guy.
The critics, of course, won't be happy until Leno is working the comedy clubs where he spends his vacations (and possibly competing against NBC from Fox).
