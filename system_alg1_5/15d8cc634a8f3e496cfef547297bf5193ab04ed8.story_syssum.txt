And Leung, a former surveyor and real estate consultant, has done little to dispel the prevailing view that he is Beijing's lackey.
"He is in daily communication with Beijing," says Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
However, it was later discovered that Leung's home in the city's exclusive Peak neighborhood also had an illegal structure.
For all his colorful nicknames, Harry Harrison, political cartoonist at the South China Morning Post, the city's main English-language newspaper, says Leung is a difficult character to portray.
The reason, says Harrison, is that Leung is rarely out and about and has little public presence, coming across as aloof.
"Beijing would ... lose face if they were to sack Leung in the near future," says Lam at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
