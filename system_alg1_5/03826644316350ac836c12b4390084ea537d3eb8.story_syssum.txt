"It's going create just under 400 jobs for 18 months constructing the bridge," says Redmond Mayor John Marchione.
Microsoft is hardly getting the bridge for free.
"We're not a one-company town," Marchione says.
"This is $11 million where we are substituting public money for private money, and that means there's some other project that would have a greater benefit than a bridge to Microsoft that's not being built," says Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense.
Microsoft is one of the most lucrative companies in the country," Ellis says.
Microsoft did not respond to CNN requests for an interview on the bridge project.
Chris Gregoire certified 138 projects, including the bridge, to receive stimulus funding.
"This project would have moved forward regardless of having the federal money or not, so it doesn't have any additional benefit to the economy," he says.
