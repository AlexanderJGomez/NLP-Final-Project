(CNN) -- A woman in Little Egg Harbor, New Jersey, came forward as part of a group of 16 that won a piece of the $448 million jackpot from Wednesday's Powerball lottery drawing.
The group's lottery ticket was worth $86 million, but between federal and state taxes and splitting the sum among the group, each contributor will received about $3.5 million, according to WPVI.
The man, 59, did not wish to be identified.
That was split among three tickets sold in Illinois, Kansas and Maryland.
