Two mortar shells also fell near the Municipal Palace, it said.
The blasts highlight the escalating crisis in Aleppo, Syria's most populous city, which has morphed into a major battleground between government and rebel forces.
More than 28,000 people have been killed across Syria since March 2011, the LCC says.
At least five people were killed and 10 injured when a shell landed on a house in the Turkish town of Akcakale, near the Syrian border, the town's mayor said Wednesday.
In return, Turkey fired on Syrian government targets.
Turkey has taken in more than 93,000 Syrian refugees, more than any other country in the region.
