BAE said Thursday it is working with American Airlines to put laser systems on the planes, which will be flying between New York and California.
DHS, American Airlines and BAE Systems were all careful to assure there will be no test firing -- through simulators or otherwise.
Terrorists tried, unsuccessfully, in 2002 to shoot down an Israeli passenger jet in Kenya with them.
Commercial airlines have opposed efforts to install defense systems, which are costly, add weight, and can weaken the plane's aerodynamics.
Last year, American and BAE installed and test flew BAE's hardware on a Boeing 767 that was not in commercial service, Hotard said.
