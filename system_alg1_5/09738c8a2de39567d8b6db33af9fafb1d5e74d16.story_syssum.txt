Thais across the country are donating food, water and clothing to help their countrymen in the worst-hit areas.
In the ancient city of Ayutthara, one of the worst-hit regions, military trucks move slowly down the main street, cutting through a constant river of water, passing out aid to those who can get close.
"It's very bad around here," he told CNN.
"We don't have enough to eat."
"Whenever we get donations, we share it all with the villagers," he says.
United Nations agencies also are on standby, activating their assessment teams and contingency planning in Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, according to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
