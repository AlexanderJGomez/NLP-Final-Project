I know that this is, for me, God's plan, and I think I'm honored to be a part of that."
Jurors recommended Monday that Steven Hayes, 47, should die for his role in the 2007 invasion of a home in Cheshire, Connecticut, that left Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, dead along with her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley Petit and 11-year-old Michaela Petit.
"I think justice has been served, but I don't know that there truly is anything just, when something like this happens," she said.
"That is burned in my memory, those pictures of those girls," Calzetta said.
"It takes a toll on your body you don't even realize," she said.
"That really affected me," she said.
Cardona said it was important to him that Hayes receive the death penalty because "I knew that he would be in a cell by himself, secluded ... that's what he hated."
But "we wanted to make sure everybody was comfortable with the decision," Cardona said.
"This is a huge deal," Calzetta said.
And it was very very difficult for us," she said.
Cardona said he did not believe testimony that Komisarjevsky triggered Hayes' rage by telling him, when he returned from the bank with Hawke-Petit, that the girls were dead.
"She had no idea what she was walking into," Calzetta said.
"It was a very emotional case and a very emotional two months," Cardona said.
"There was never a shouting match," he said.
"This family is so dignified, gracious, classy," he said.
It's heartwarming," Calzetta said.
Cardona said he thought he would be all right because he's seen movies and television, but he found it's different when something actually took place.
