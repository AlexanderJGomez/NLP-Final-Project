Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama said Wednesday his administration will respond to new Ebola cases "in a much more aggressive way," taking charge of the issue after a second Texas health care worker was diagnosed with the disease.
Doing so, he said, "is an investment in our own public health.
"The administration must be able to assure Americans that we will stop the spread here at home," Boehner, an Ohio Republican, said in a statement.
Perry said Wednesday that he speaks daily with Dr. Brett Giroir, who heads an infectious disease task force that Perry formed earlier this month, and Dr. David Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services.
"These individuals are keeping the health and safety of Texans and the needs of the patients as their most critical tasks," he said.
