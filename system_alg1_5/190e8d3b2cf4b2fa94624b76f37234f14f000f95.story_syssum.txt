"It's been a nightmare," her mother, Bernadette Kero, told CNN on Wednesday.
On September 5, Addison was sharing a cab from near the Indonesian border to Dili, the capital of East Timor, when the journey turned into a traveler's nightmare.
"My daughter was in the vehicle in the backseat," Kero said.
"The person who picked up the package, he told the police and he testified before the judge that he didn't know my daughter," Kero said.
"I am under a lot of stress and very scared about the future, but I am trying to stay strong," she said in a Facebook post on September 24.
"We consider this to be a violation of human rights," Remedios said, but he warned that under East Timor's criminal procedure law, an individual can be held in detention for up to a year while there is an ongoing investigation.
For her first five days in Gleno prison, Addison was held on her own, according to Kero.
The U.S. Embassy is in "close contact" with Addison and a consular official visited her in prison on Tuesday, the State Department official said.
Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley's office is also working with the family, he said.
