But for many others, including myself, Twitter has become the new "Fight Club."
Twitter, on the other hand, is the Wild West in the 1800s -- it's new, unsettled and often savage.
This is what Twitter is to many.
And on Twitter, you're not required to be polite like you are in the real world.
It's truly alarming.
Sure, you can do that, but as Tyler Durden instructively told us in "Fight Club": "How much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight."
In today's hyperpartisan climate, many just associate with like-minded people and consequently their views on political issues are never challenged.
That's not to excuse the alarming rise of racist, sexist, homophobic and other hate filled comments on Twitter.
If enough of us collectively speak out, Twitter can become a social media platform where users share info, joke around and even fight with each other, but all without being subject to hate.
