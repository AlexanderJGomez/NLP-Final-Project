As an independent myself, I usually cheer the prospect of any independent campaign.
An independent candidate running on a proven record of executive leadership, job creation and improving American competitiveness could be a serious presidential candidate this time around.
But crucially, Perot was decidedly liberal-to-libertarian in his social beliefs.
Many would cheer.
But it will hurt both Trump and the GOP in the long run, while nuking any hope he had of appealing to independent voters.
Trump would not.
This is predictable but pathetic.
As a result, he sacrificed his right to be taken seriously as well as any claims he had to represent independent voters credibly in the 2012 election.
