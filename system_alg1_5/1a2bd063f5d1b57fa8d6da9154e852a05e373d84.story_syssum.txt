(CNN) -- The Seattle artist Moxie makes sculptures out of felted wool that are, like her, desperately playful and mad.
She tried many crafts before stumbling, through a children's workshop, on feltmaking.
she asked herself, then started poking "a bajillion times."
"Each poke, you are deciding what the piece will be and mean," she said.
That was about my parents.
That was about loss.
We all have a complicated back story and I'm sure it's there in my work.
That's when I know my piece is working.
I was like someone playing with a new toy, getting some satisfaction from the look, feel and whimsy of it.
I don't know.
Moxie: I believe in the high five.
I just believe in the potential of people.
One way is to connect to you.
A relatively new one, "Back to Work," is about productivity and creative process.
That is white hot, really good.
