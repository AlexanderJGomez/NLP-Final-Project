(CNN) -- Speaking Saturday at the Summit of the Americas, President Barack Obama said it is reasonable to debate alternatives in the war on drugs, but insisted legalizing drugs wasn't a valid option in the United States.
On the other extreme, legalization.
"This summit is not going to resolve this issue," he said.
"I personally, and my administration's position is, that legalization is not the answer."
The United States has "never been more excited" to work as equal partners with countries in Latin America, Obama said earlier Saturday -- a vow that's been made before by U.S. presidents, but that nonetheless drew applause from the audience of business leaders.
"Oftentimes in the press, the attention at summits like this ends up focusing on the controversies," the president added.
There were no casualties, and only minor damage was reported, Toncell said.
The explosions came on the heels of a similar one earlier in the day near the U.S. Embassy in the capital city of Bogota, authorities said.
