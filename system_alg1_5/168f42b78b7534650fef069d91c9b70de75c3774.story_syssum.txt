It was January 3, 1983 -- Monday Night Football, Dallas vs. Minnesota.
Dorsett was so free, so graceful and so powerful to me.
But after 30 years, my love and respect for the game is fading.
Players with CTE have battled depression, memory loss, and in some cases dementia.
"I do not have a son; if I had a son, I wouldn't necessarily discourage him from playing football, but I don't know that I would encourage him to play, either.
With that in mind, that's concerning.
Instead, I thank God that my son never wanted to play football, that it was basketball that stole his heart.
Play other sports.
My younger son didn't play, and to this day I'm grateful," said Carson, who begs his daughter not to let his grandson play.
I agree.
"They were irresponsible men, or had bad agents, girlfriends, wives who took advantage of them," we explained.
I want to save my relationship with the league, but it needs to own up about CTE.
This relationship is toxic.
