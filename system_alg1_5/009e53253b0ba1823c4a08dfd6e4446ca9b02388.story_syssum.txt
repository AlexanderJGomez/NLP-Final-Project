And, I would suggest, she should have gone further: There's reason to think that bombing is exactly what ISIS wants us to do.
And we are obliging.
Writing in Mother Jones, Kevin Drum, explained: "All it took was a carefully stagecrafted beheading video and the usual gang of conservative jingoists to exploit it."
ISIS then beheaded a British journalist, so the British stepped up its military support in the campaign against ISIS.
Yes, the violent terrorism of ISIS is medieval and inhumane.
And we are playing into ISIS' hands: In Syria, ISIS had to put up giant screens to show its beheading videos.
But right now, we are the dog being wagged by the tail of ISIS.
America's homeland, thankfully, has not been the direct target of ISIS violence, but we have been the target of this propaganda.
Recruits are flocking to ISIS.
Otherwise, no matter how much territory we bomb, ISIS will keep winning.
