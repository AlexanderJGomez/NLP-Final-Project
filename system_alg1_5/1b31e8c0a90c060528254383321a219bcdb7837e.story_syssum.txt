"The possible consequences of further international spread are particularly serious in view of the virulence of the virus, the intensive community and health facility transmission patterns, and the weak health systems in the currently affected and most at-risk countries," WHO said Friday after two days of emergency meetings.
"Declaring Ebola an international public health emergency shows how seriously WHO is taking the current outbreak, but statements won't save lives," said Dr. Bart Janssens, director of operations for Doctors Without Borders, a humanitarian organization.
"All our Ebola experts are mobilized, we simply cannot do more," Janseens said.
Though infectious, Ebola "is not  mysterious" and can be contained, Fukuda said.
Washington said it's sending experts to Liberia, including 12 specialists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and a 13-member disaster assistance response team from the U.S. Agency for International Development.
Ebola spreads through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, urine and other secretions of infected people.
