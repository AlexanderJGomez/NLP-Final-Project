Raymond Soeoth, pictured here with his wife, says he was injected with drugs by ICE agents against his will.
Dr. Paul Appelbaum, a professor of psychiatry, law and ethics at Columbia University, reviewed both men's medical records for this report and was stunned by what he discovered.
Responding to Lieberman's written questions, Myers said 1,073 immigration detainees had "medical escorts" for deportation since 2003.
"First, I am aware of, and deeply concerned about reports that past practices may not have conformed to ICE detention standards," Myers said.
"They pushed me on the bench, they opened my pants, and they just give me injection," he said through broken English.
In the records, the government says he was injected with the drug after he said he would kill himself if deported -- a remark Soeoth denies ever making.
But, Diouf says, he was injected on the plane right before he was to be deported.
"What they did to me was very, very bad."
