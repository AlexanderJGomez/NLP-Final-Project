(CNN) -- College costs too much, both for students and for society as a whole.
Whereas private businesses cut prices for consumers and costs to themselves through efficiencies that increase profits and incomes, universities lack those incentives.
They please these constituencies by raising, and then spending, lots of money.
Like health care, prices are rising rapidly for higher education because of the predominant role of third-party payments -- federal student loans and grants, state government support for institutions and students, private philanthropic gifts and endowment income.
When some else is paying a lot of the bills, students are less sensitive to the price, thus allowing the colleges to care less about keeping prices under control.
As mentioned above, incentives to conserve resources are few.
If information and incentives are provided, innovation will come.
According to my analysis of the data, more than 17 million college graduates were "underemployed" in 2008.
Like it or not, American higher education is in for big change in the next generation.
