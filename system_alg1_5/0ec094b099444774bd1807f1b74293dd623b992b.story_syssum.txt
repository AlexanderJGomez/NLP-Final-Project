When more than 200 girls were in April 2014 kidnapped by Boko Haram terrorists from their school in Chibok, the international community rallied around Nigeria.
At about the same time that the Baga bloodbath was making headlines around the world, the international community was rallying around France in support against the terrorist attacks on the Charlie Hebdo newspaper offices in Paris, giving rise to the #JeSuisCharlie social media campaign.
So far, he has said nothing about Baga.
Perhaps it is not that the Nigerian government does not care about its own people.
Boys have been kidnapped.
Last year, President Jonathan's wife, Patience, openly queried the veracity of the missing girls report.
They believe that, similar to the World Bank's assertion that more than 67% of Nigerians are living in poverty, the Baga reports are all part of the international community's grand conspiracy to taint Nigeria, to make our country look bad.
Nevertheless, the ongoing carnage in Nigeria's northeast will definitely be a determining factor in the outcome of the February elections.
Whatever happens at the polls, Nigeria has to at some point face the Boko Haram issue squarely -- even after the international media frenzy around the group's latest attacks has died down, as it surely will.
