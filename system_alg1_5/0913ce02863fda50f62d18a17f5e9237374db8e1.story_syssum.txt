Spacewalkers remove a camera from the Hubble on Thursday.
"OK, here we go.
"Very nice."
"This is a huge accomplishment," Preston Burch, Hubble Space Telescope program manager, said during a briefing.
Atlantis launched Monday afternoon for NASA's fifth and final repair visit to the telescope.
It's been seven years since the last space shuttle crew worked on the telescope, which has been latched to a rotating, "lazy Susan"-type device for five days of repairs and remodeling.
NASA canceled an Atlantis mission to extend Hubble's operational life in January 2004 because the trip was considered too risky in the wake of the 2003 space shuttle Columbia disaster, which killed seven astronauts.
But public pressure and steps taken to increase shuttle safety led the space agency to reconsider.
