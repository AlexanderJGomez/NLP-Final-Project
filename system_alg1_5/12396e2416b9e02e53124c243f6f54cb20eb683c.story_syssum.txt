The group, al-Nusra Front, also denies an earlier claim that it has merged with Iraq's al Qaeda affiliate, according to an audio message purported to be from al-Nusra general commander Abu Muhammad al-Joulani.
Still, such a pledge "will not change the policies of Nusra Front on the ground," al-Joulani said.
Al-Joulani's message comes a week after the White House, according to U.S. officials, signed off on new nonlethal aid for Syrian rebels.
Kerry urged the opposition to work together and organize more effectively, the officials said.
President Barack Obama agreed last month to send food and medicine to the rebels, the first direct U.S. support for the armed opposition.
Opposition activists reported at least 75 more deaths on Wednesday amid heavy fighting in and around Damascus and Daraa.
