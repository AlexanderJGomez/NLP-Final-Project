"No representative from TSA will be present," Pistole said in a statement posted on the agency's website.
The committee insisted it has legislative jurisdiction when it comes to the airline industry and its passengers, who help finance TSA operations through security fees.
"TSA is missing the point," said Justin Harclerode, a spokesman for the full committee.
Industry representatives will also appear.
