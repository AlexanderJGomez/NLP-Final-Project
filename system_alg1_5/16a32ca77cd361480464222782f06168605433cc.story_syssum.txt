Heavy D, whose real name is Dwight Errington Myers, was found conscious with difficulty breathing at his home after police were called, the Beverly Hills police said.
His last album, "Love Opus," was released this year.
DVT occurs when a blood clot forms in a deep vein, usually in the lower leg, thigh or pelvis.
People may recover from having a small clot, but a large one can stop blood from reaching the lungs and is fatal.
