Nigeria's minister for state of petroleum, Odein Ajumogobia, talked this month about the developments.
Nigeria welcomes China's recent interest in investing in Nigeria's oil industry, Ajumogobia added.
"There is no deal yet," he said.
Last week, the group said it was calling off the truce, but there have not been renewed attacks.
Nigeria hopes to leverage the fragile peace to reap big dollars from its oil industry, Ajumogobia said.
