"The whole bridge from one side of the Mississippi to the other just completely gave way, fell all the way down," survivor Gary Babineau told CNN.
They were yelling, screaming, bleeding.
They were in the middle of the Mississippi River, which was churning fast, and he had no way of getting to them.
"I could see the whole bridge as it was going down, as it was falling," Babineau said.
I saw a couple cars fall," he said.
"I just wanted off the bridge, and then I ran over to the school bus.
"I just knew what I had to do at the moment."
"I had no idea there was a vehicle on my car," she told AP.
Babineau told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune: "On the way down, I thought I was dead.
After the bridge settled and his car remained upright, "I just put in park, turned the key off and said, 'Oh, I'm alive,' " he said.
