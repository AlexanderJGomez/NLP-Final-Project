HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN)  -- Deaths in Zimbabwe related to the cholera epidemic are approaching 2,000, the World Health Organization said Tuesday, and close to 40,000 people have been affected by the preventable water-borne disease.
Last month, Mugabe's government declared the cholera epidemic a national emergency.
Since then, international governments and organizations such as WHO, Doctors Without Borders, Oxfam, USAID and other U.N. groups have moved in to combat the disease that has engulfed all of Zimbabwe's provinces.
The sides continue to debate the sharing of key Cabinet ministries such as information, local government, finance, defense and home affairs.
