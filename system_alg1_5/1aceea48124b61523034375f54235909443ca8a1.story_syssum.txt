Chad Schaffner, 37, was arrested in Kingdom City, Missouri, about 2:45 p.m. Saturday, said Missouri State Highway Patrol radio operator Paula Price.
Lakey, who was staying at the motel, said he remembered seeing news reports about a man sought in a string of bank robberies, so he looked on the Web site of the television show "America's Most Wanted" to check a vehicle description in the case.
A spokeswoman for the Callaway County Jail, in Fulton, Missouri, said Schaffner was booked into the facility about 8 p.m. Saturday.
Schaffner will appear in court Monday in Jefferson City, Missouri, according to Bridget Patton, spokeswoman for the FBI's Kansas City, Missouri, office.
While no one was harmed, the FBI said they considered the suspect dangerous.
Two bank robberies occurred in Morristown and Jefferson City, Tennessee, on August 18, authorities said.
During the first interview, she spoke to agents outside her apartment and denied knowing him, the complaint said.
He had threatened to kill the children if she told agents he was there, the woman said.
