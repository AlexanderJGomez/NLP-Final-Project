But so does inaction.
Syria may seem far away, but every passing day, every calamitous, explosive, hate-infused day, makes it more America's -- and the world's -- problem.
Horrified by the effects of chemical weapons in the battlefield, nations have come together over the years to develop international bans on nerve gases, blister agents, blood agents and choking agents.
The Syrian government, by all appearances, used nerve gas to kill hundreds of its own citizens.
In the meantime, the war is bursting beyond Syrian borders.
Millions of Syrians have fled their homes, straining resources and occasionally raining fire into Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq and even Israel.
4) Inaction will hand a victory to al-Assad, Iran and Hezbollah: The Obama administration is telegraphing an attack against Syria aimed at punishing al-Assad and sending a message to the world, rather than seeking to change the course of this civil war.
Iranian and Hezbollah agents have been implicated in terrorist plots in Argentina, Cyprus, Bulgaria, India and elsewhere.
It is now a hate-filled maelstrom of Sunnis, Shiites, Allawites, Christians, Kurds and others.
Beyond that, Washington should do what it should have done long ago.
Then they can remove al-Assad from power by wining what is, most assuredly, their war, the Syrians' war, but one that is of great consequence to America and to the rest of the world.
