In this high-profile talk to his own demographic, the president has some explaining to do.
In appearances before African-American audiences, the president sometimes sounds like he's saying the wrong thing.
They suffer the highest level of incarceration, and the largest homicide rates, of any Americans.
Nobody understands, like this audience will, the contortions a successful African-American man has to make to fit in but stand out, to be strong but not intimidate or frighten, to be black enough but not too black.
Emanuel Cleaver, while chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said "the president knows we are going to act in deference to him in a way we wouldn't to someone white."
President Obama provides, for Morehouse men and everyone else, a 21st century model of African-American masculinity.
President Obama cannot, on his own, reverse this course, but he can do much more than he has to disrupt the flow of the one in three young black men who are headed to prison.
African-American men feel a special kinship with this president.
How inspiring it would be for the president to acknowledge this connection, in his words and in his actions.
