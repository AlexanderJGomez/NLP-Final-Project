"It was about a mother who decided to give her child up for adoption because she couldn't stand to hear her crying from hunger," Cutler remembered.
"I had the intention, originally, of finding a local organization to donate them to that would benefit my neighbors," said Cutler, 34.
Today, Cutler and her volunteers solicit donations of new or gently used baby items in their neighborhoods.
"I wanted to assure these people who were donating so generously to us that these things were absolutely going into hands that needed them," she said.
"I'm their mom, and I should be able to do whatever it is that I need to do for them."
"New clothes, diapers and wipes, they're a constant expense," Harding said.
They deserve all of the basics," Cutler said.
"If what we're doing helps bridge the gap between people from different socioeconomic backgrounds, even in a small way, then it's definitely worth all the hard work."
