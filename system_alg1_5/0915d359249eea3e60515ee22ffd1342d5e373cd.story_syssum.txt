Android grew its already significant chunk of the smartphone market to 68.8% last year, while Apple's iOS operating system stayed comfortably in second place with 18.8% of smartphone shipments, according to new stats from research firm IDC.
However, according to Gartner it was previous iPhone models, which dropped in price enough to make them a more appealing option in emerging markets, that accounted for much of Apple's smartphone success.
Samsung sold 384.6 million phones in 2012, only 53.5% of which were smartphones, according to Gartner.
Though it only made up 2.6% of the smartphone market in 2012, it did grow its number of shipments an impressive 98.9%, according to IDC.
Overall, the number of phone sales in 2012 actually dropped 1.7% from the previous year, the first drop since 2009.
