"It's just surreal how quickly someone can go, and how much we take for granted everyday," said Danvers High School student Chris Weimert, describing Ritzer as "the nicest teacher you could ever have.
They got a call around 11:20 p.m. about another missing person, 24-year-old Ritzer, after she, too, hadn't returned home and was not answering her phone, according to Essex County District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett.
In court, it was alleged the teenager "did assault and beat" Ritzer, leading to her death.
The 14-year-old was arraigned Wednesday afternoon in a Salem, Massachusetts, court for murder, then ordered held without bail.
"I don't know why she had to die," freshman Spencer Wade said of Ritzer, adding that the mysterious and bloody nature of her death made it even harder to deal with.
Chism attended fourth grade at a Clarksville, Tennessee, elementary school, said Clarksville-Montgomery County, Tennessee, school system spokeswoman Elise Shelton.
"He ... seemed quiet and reserved, but he just seemed normal," said Ariana Edwards, who was in Chism's English class.
Blodgett declined Wednesday to offer specifics on the relationship between the suspect and the late teacher, though his office said Chism attended one of Ritzer's classes.
"I'd say he's less 'polite and friendly' than you thought," wrote one Facebook commenter.
Ritzer graduated from Assumption College in 2011, that school said on Twitter.
"She was energetic, she was compassionate," Dzerkacz said.
"She always wanted to be a teacher, all her life," Martellucci said.
"She was always the teacher (who would) go the extra mile for students, always the teacher to be there for students after school," said Kyle Cahill.
