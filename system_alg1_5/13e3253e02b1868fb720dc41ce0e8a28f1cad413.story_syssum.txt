"When a big rain would come, she'd always get out and dance in the rain," the teen's mother, Auliea Hanlon, said.
Cherice's teachers saw it, too, as her grades suffered and her gregarious personality dimmed.
And she had the most beautiful laugh," Hanlon said.
As news of the sexual assault disseminated through their hometown of Billings, Montana, Cherice was ostracized and bullied.
Cherice was tough, determined and certainly strong-willed, her mother said.
"She could probably out-cook Subway -- vegetables on everything," her mother said.
Her mother called her "Dada," a play on "daughter," while everyone else called her Cherry, the name her aunt gave her the day she was born.
"I don't do horror flicks," Hanlon said.
"We'd be down in the living room -- crank it up, open the windows, open the doors and she danced," Hanlon said, recalling how she and Cherice listened to their favorite tunes.
She and her close friend, Tiffany, would stay outside in Cherice's battered tent, which leaked.
She also enjoyed poetry, and Hanlon described her daughter's style as "darker," reminiscent of Edgar Allan Poe.
But in the end, we love, no matter what -- that sort of thing."
