If you hadn't heard his name before, you certainly have now: John Brooks is the 21-year-old who came in as a substitute into the USA vs Ghana game Monday, and scored a header to keep America's hope alive in the World Cup in Brazil.
And while he has relatives stateside, his main attachments are in Berlin where his mother's from, he said in his U.S. Soccer video portrait.
His video portrait on U.S. Soccer's website is heavily edited, sometimes in mid-sentence, and his German accent comes through at times, but he says he's proud to be part of the U.S. team.
It's an honor to wear this jersey," he said.
Then, he rushed to the airport to make his first U.S. national team match.
In addition to Brooks, the team boasts Jermaine Jones, Timothy Chandler, Julian Green and Fabian Johnson -- all of them U.S.-German dual nationals.
...well, that's German for "Goal!!"
