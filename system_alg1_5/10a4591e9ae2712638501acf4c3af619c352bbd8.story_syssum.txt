Though authorities now believe Wiles was killed, they don't know where his body is, he said.
At the time, agents said Wiles' father tried to comply with the demand to get back his son, but heard nothing.
Holt is described as an employee who, at least at one time, had a supervisory role at the company.
Without disclosing details, agents said the investigation led them back to Holt and his whereabouts the day Wiles disappeared.
When CNN interviewed them last year, Wiles' mother, Pamela, said, "We're willing to work with them and do anything to get him back.
"Our investigation and evidence obtained to date indicate he's dead, " Couvertier said.
