According to Yemen's official news agency, SABA, the parliament agreed in principle to continue discussing the proposed constitutional amendments and then referred the matter to a special committee.
After Saturday's parliamentary procedure, Yemen's ruling party criticized the U.S. call for a delay on the vote, calling it interference in internal affairs and its sovereignty, SABA reported, attributing it to an unnamed source in the General People's Congress.
"The United States has seen reports regarding the apparent decision by Yemen's ruling General People's Conference to vote on a package of constitutional reforms at a parliamentary session on Saturday, January 1," acting U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in a statement.
Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, has been in office for 32 years and was last re-elected in 2006.
According to the Yemen Post, as of last Wednesday, the opposition had boycotted parliamentary sittings for a fifth consecutive day.
For that reason, we urgently call on all parties to delay parliamentary action and to return to the negotiating table to reach an agreement that will be welcomed by the Yemeni people as well as Yemen's friends."
