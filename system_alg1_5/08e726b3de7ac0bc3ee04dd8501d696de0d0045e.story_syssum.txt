By comparison, "Black-ish's" lead-in, the multiple Emmy-winning "Modern Family," started its sixth season Wednesday with 10.9 million watching and a rating of 3.7.
"I guess for a kid from the 'hood, I'm living the American dream," Anderson's Dre says in an opening voiceover.
And at work, Dre is faced with eye-rolling questions from colleagues on "how a black man would say good morning," and the possibility that he was promoted to head the agency's "urban" division because of his race.
But while Dre's fretting could (and does) raise more serious conversations about race, class and identity, "Black-ish" is still a comedy, and critics have praised it for knowing just how to leverage its complex subject for laughs.
Giving it a "B" grade, EW's critic felt the comedy "skews too broad," and some of that mixed reaction could be found on Twitter.
"For now, I can only say what I want to hear about any new half-hour: it happens to be funny."
