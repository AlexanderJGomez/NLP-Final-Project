Barca's Spain striker David Villa and Real's Germany playmaker Mesut Ozil were red-carded for their involvement in the melee, despite both players having already been substituted.
Benzema scored a second equalizer for Real before Messi's late strike stole glory for Barca, but Mourinho was happy with what he saw from his charges.
"Real Madrid gave a spectacular performance from the first to the last minute," Mourinho told the nine-time European champion's web site.
"Pepe and Marcelo played a great game, one for the entire 90 minutes and the other for 45.
"What will stay with me is the inhuman effort of the players," he said.
