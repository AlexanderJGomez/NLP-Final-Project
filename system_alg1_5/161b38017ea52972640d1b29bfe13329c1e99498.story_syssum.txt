Attorneys will select 18 jurors, including six alternates.
Hernandez, 25, has pleaded not guilty.
In the months leading up to jury selection, Hernandez's defense attorneys, who insist Hernandez will be exonerated, have been trying to chip away at the prosecution's case.
At 3:22 a.m., Lloyd texted, "Nfl."
Minutes later, witnesses heard shots fired at an industrial park about a mile from Hernandez's home, they told prosecutors.
In court papers, prosecutors have suggested the gun may have been thrown away by Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins.
Investigators say a vehicle that appears to match the description of a car rented by Hernandez is seen on security cameras driving through the industrial park, allegedly with Hernandez, Wallace, Ortiz, and Lloyd inside.
At this point, prosecutors have not publicly presented their theory.
In a surprising move, investigators got a warrant to search Hernandez's home again, more than a year after their last entry.
The shooting is inadmissible, Garsh ruled.
He's pleaded not guilty in that case, too, and the trial is pending.
Inside Hernandez's home, jurors will see the layout and its multicamera video security system.
With Hernandez and his family watching, as well as the family and friends of victim Odin Lloyd, we're about to find out.
