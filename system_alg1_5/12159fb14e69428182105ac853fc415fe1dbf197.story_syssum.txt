In our solar system, only three planets lie in the sun's habitable zone -- Venus, Earth and Mars.
Planets farther from their star, like Jupiter, are too cold, at least on its surface -- although Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, may have oceans of liquid water beneath an icy crust.
It orbits its star once every 267 days, very similar to the 225-day period of Venus.
Since Kepler 62 is a cooler star than our sun, planets can orbit closer to it than the Earth can to our sun before overheating.
In contrast, the third Earth-like planet, Kepler 69c, orbits a star very similar to our sun (that is, hotter than Kepler 62).
If there is, it's unlikely to look like ET, canal-building aliens, or any other science fiction-type fantasy.
As of April 19, 2013, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Planet Quest website reports 851 confirmed planets and 2781 candidates, totaling as many as 3,632 exoplanets.
In fact, we've been broadcasting television signals to the cosmos for more than 80 years.
That means they probably could let us know they were here, if they wanted to.
"Oh yes," he answered, "the ones in the habitable zone."
Thanks to Kepler, NASA, dedicated scientists and curious citizens, we are that much closer to finding out.
