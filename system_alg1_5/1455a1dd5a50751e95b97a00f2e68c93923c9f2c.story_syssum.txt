"There has been no agreement reached between Ms. Rowe and the Jacksons," George said.
"Ms. Rowe has not accepted -- and will not accept -- any additional financial consideration beyond the spousal support she and Michael Jackson personally agreed to several years ago," George said.
A child custody court hearing, which had been set for this week, was delayed until next Monday at the request of lawyers for Jackson and Rowe, a court official said.
"Among the several contenders for overzealous and inaccurate sensationalism, the New York Post has now seized top honors," George wrote to the paper.
"I said, 'So, be a dad.'
I want to do this.
Rowe claimed in the 2003 interview that she still had "some influence" over how Jackson raised the children, citing his practice of covering their faces in public as her idea.
"That was my request, not his," she said.
Rowe, 50, lives on a horse farm in Palmdale, California, about 60 miles north of Los Angeles.
