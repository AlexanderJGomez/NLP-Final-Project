Now, the question is how President Barack Obama will respond.
Obama "will be making an informed decision about how to respond to this indiscriminate use" of chemical weapons, Kerry added, saying the president "believes there must be accountability" for those who use them.
The administration also wants it to be a quick response to the use of chemical weapons, the senior administration official said.
"And yet, here we are again.
"Obviously, the intelligence assessment is ongoing," she said.
The Obama administration is expected to declassify the intelligence assessment backing up its assertion that the Syrian regime was responsible for last week's chemical weapons attack, another senior administration official said.
Meanwhile, a senior Defense Department official told CNN's Chris Lawrence Monday that four U.S. Navy destroyers "maintain readiness and, if required, could execute a mission within hours" of being ordered to do so.
In addition, a military strike would seek to degrade the Syrian regime's capabilities enough to weaken it without causing it to fall to an opposition considered unprepared to assume power, the official said.
The missiles would be used to strike "command and control" facilities such as command bunkers, or the Syrian regime's means of delivering chemical weapons: artillery batteries and launchers.
To Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, the situation is forcing Obama to shift from being an "avoider-in-chief" regarding military involvement in Syria.
Schiff agreed that Obama has little choice but to respond strongly.
