For the first time, Boehner this weekend had offered to accept tax rate increases on household income over $1 million, sources said.
"The president's proposal is the only proposal that we have seen that achieves the balance that is so necessary" between revenue and cost-cutting, said Carney, who refused to discuss specifics.
"Any movement away from the unrealistic offers the president has made previously is a step in the right direction, but a proposal that includes $1.3 trillion in revenue for only $930 billion in spending cuts cannot be considered balanced," Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said.
Obama's plan, Republican aides said, does not include a 1-1 ratio of spending cuts and revenue.
Boehner has been under pressure from the White House, Democrats, the business community and some fellow Republicans to give up the staunch opposition to any increase in tax rates.
Obama and Democrats argue that increased revenue, including higher tax rates on the wealthy, must be part of broader deficit reduction to prevent the middle class from getting hit too hard.
Without that mechanism, Congress would have to approve all debt-ceiling increases.
