Readers get a behind-the-scenes look at the FBI and LAPD's work, but the documents are heavily redacted, hiding the names of sources, investigators and suspects.
Shakur recorded for Marion "Suge" Knight's Los Angeles-based Death Row Records, while Smalls was signed with New York-based Bad Boy Entertainment, founded by Sean "Puffy" Combs.
The newly-published documents, despite the redactions, do indicate tension between the FBI and LAPD.
"That theory doesn't even add up," says Cathy Scott, who wrote "The Killing of Tupac Shakur," noting that Knight was sitting in the driver's seat next to the rapper.
But two months after Shakur's killing, Knight talked to ABC News and one quote seems to follow the former record company executive: "If you knew who killed Tupac, would you tell police?"
I don't get paid to tell on people."
