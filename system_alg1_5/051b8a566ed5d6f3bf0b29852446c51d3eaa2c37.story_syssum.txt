The selection of Ryan as Romney's running mate has heated the spotlight on the economy, on the huge and growing national debt, and on the large number of Americans who, years after the start of recession, remain unemployed.
Sensing Obama's vulnerability, Romney and Ryan would like to keep the focus there.
When it comes to cheering America's greatness, Obama was at first reluctant.
And so did Romney, who tried to draw a distinction with the president by launching his campaign with a book unsubtly titled, "No Apology: The Case for American Greatness."
And, by the way, we have to.
Romney once, a little bafflingly, declared that Russia is America's main foe.
When Romney took his recent overseas trip, his objective was to highlight differences with Obama.
Obama's effort to win over Muslims, which has largely failed, created the impression that the alliance between Israel and the United States is not as strong as it once was.
But overall, America's foreign policy choices, based on national interest, national values, strategic considerations and popular opinion, will not significantly change regardless of whether Obama or Romney wins the presidential election.
Romney and Ryan, if they win, are likely to up American involvement in the Syrian conflict, and they may well preside over an American conflict with Iran.
