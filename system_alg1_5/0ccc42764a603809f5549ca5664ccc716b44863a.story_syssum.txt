(CNN) -- Whoever killed six people in a Memphis, Tennessee, home may still be on the loose, police said Tuesday.
"We need the community's help," he said.
We know that there are people out there that heard things, saw something.
At least one of the wounded children also was stabbed, police told the Commercial Appeal newspaper.
"I heard about six or seven shots," said Wayne Bolden, a landscaper who said he lives across the street from the home where the killings occurred.
"I did not know him by name," Bolden said of the man.
"There are multiple families affected by this," said Norman, who said he did not want to speak about what led to the killings.
"They were very nice, very polite to me," Robinson told the paper of the residents.
"It's kind of sad, and scary too."
"I've been on a scene where there were one or two or three [victims], but I don't remember anything this large," Guin told the Commercial Appeal.
