The Broncos said Tuesday that superstar quarterback Peyton Manning, a free agent, would join the team, setting in motion efforts to trade Tebow.
ESPN, quoting a source with the Broncos, reported the hangup was over language in Tebow's contract.
"It will be up to us to put him in the position to be successful," said Tannenbaum.
A lot of the talk about Tebow, 24, has centered around his demonstrations of his faith.
Broncos executive John Elway, in a statement issued Wednesday night, said, "Tim Tebow deserves an enormous amount of credit for what he accomplished and how he carried himself during his time with the Broncos.
"I think there is going to be this period of mourning for Tim Tebow's departure," Daly said.
"I think that that affection that people have for Tebow goes well beyond Denver and his ability to play football."
