Hamas, the Islamist group which dominates the Gaza strip, has been at odds with the Egyptian government since the country's former President, Mohammed Morsy, was ousted in a coup in the summer of 2013.
CNN has attempted to reach Mousa Abu Marzouk, the Hamas representative in Egypt, for comment.
The armed wing of Hamas, the al Qassam Brigades, was designated a terror group by the same court last month.
Typically, foreign policy decisions in Egypt are left to the executive branch of government.
