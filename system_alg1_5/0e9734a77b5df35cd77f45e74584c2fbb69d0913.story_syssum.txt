See, not taking a fashion risk is a risk in itself, Bernard said, adding, "It's important to mix it up."
"It's so great to see anybody step out of the box and do something not so traditional," said stylist to the stars Nicole Chavez, whose clients include Rachel Bilson, Scarlett Johansson and Kristen Bell.
It's about wearing something flattering in a style you love, said the new mom, who hasn't outfitted anyone this awards season.
"The red carpet is a very intense situation, and you want to be comfortable out there," Chavez said.
Even for the Academy Awards, which calls for mostly floor-length gowns, "shoes are still in the game," she said.

Kudos to you," she said.
A nude gown is "so incredibly stunning in real life, yet, just doesn't translate on TV or in photos," Chavez said.
"There are a bunch of ... cool, young, beautiful girls experimenting with fashion," she said, giving a nod to Rooney Mara, who has been playing with cutouts and black and white.
But the fashionistas who push the envelope are the ones we'll be talking about long after awards season.
