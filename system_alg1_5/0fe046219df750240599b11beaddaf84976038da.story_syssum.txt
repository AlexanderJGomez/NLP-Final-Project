It's the most visited recreational forest in the country, a hub of skiing aficionados, thanks to nearby Aspen and Vail, and it's also the home of the 2012 U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree.
"This was the first time that White River's ever had the privilege of providing it, so it was a big deal for us," said Bill Kight, a Forest Service spokesman.
During the winter season, the major attractions include skiing, snowmobiling and sledding, as well as other icy sports.
"It's amazing to see the faces of the people as they come through the gates, and they leave, and they make those Christmas memories," said Callaway Gardens spokeswoman Rachel Crumbley.
Thanks to its proximity to the mountains, Lake Placid offers "just what the Adirondacks offer," said Kim Rielly, spokeswoman at the Lake Placid Convention and Visitors Bureau.
And from December 7-9, Lake Placid will host a "Holiday Village Stroll," featuring workshops, holiday story time, a "Jingle Bell Run" and more.
Last on the list is a wonderland across the globe, "the official home of Santa Claus," at Rovaniemi in Finland.
"The Santa Claus Main Post Office is a real post office, which operates 365 days in the year," she said.
After that, guests can ride a sleigh or visit the reindeer farm or even explore the Arctic Circle, which begins at the edge of Rovaniemi.
