Music was the heartbeat of the $42.3 million spectacular, an aural backdrop arguably worthy of the "Isle of Wonders" hype, creating an almost tangible cultural DNA of what the organizers feel is to be British.
Beijing may have had an athlete running around the roof of the arena but London had McCartney play out with "Hey Jude" leaving television viewers from around the world no doubt humming a chorus that even language proves no barrier to: "Nah, na, na , nananna nah, nananna nah ..." etc.
Jamie Fullerton - features editor for the NME (New Musical Express), Britain's pre-eminent weekly music magazine, told CNN: "What's really interesting is the set included bands like New Order and Happy Mondays, organizers tipping their hat towards the cult element of British rock 'n' roll music, which is very different to what you see at an event like the Superbowl.
New Order were the ultimate cult band, coming from Factory Records, a small independent record label, and being from Manchester.
"As for The Beatles, they are the biggest band of all time.
The Londoner's second album, 21, sold 18 million copies, accounting for 1.6% of all albums sold in the global music market that year.
Eight out of 10 thought we did, and the same number said they were proud of the music Britain produces.
But, arguably, by putting popular music at the center of the showpiece Boyle, and the local organizers, focused on an area where Britain can still boast of superpower status.
Now, back to the "Nanana nahs."
