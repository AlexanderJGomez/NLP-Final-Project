No one wanted a repeat of such flagrant aggression, so the Charter was drawn up to replace gunboat diplomacy with peaceful measures overseen by the U.N. Security Council.
In 1945 the U.N. Charter was ratified by the U.S., the UK, and the majority of the 50 states who had originally agreed to this framework.
But regime change, however desirable, is not permitted by the Charter.
If it were, the powerful nations could go round the world picking off the weak -- or more particularly the states thought to be hostile to their own ambitions.
This argument, which was false, became the main basis for invasion because the only other route to war had been closed off by international law.
There was no going back.
This was why Bush and Blair were not prepared to allow the weapons inspectors, who were in Iraq, any more time.
It is intolerable and inexcusable.
The UK, to their credit, signed up to the court.
As a result, a legal consortium of which I was a part, and other groups in Europe, petitioned the ICC for action against UK politicians over their involvement in the war.
Then if a U.S. perpetrator of war crimes travelled into that country's jurisdiction, they could be arrested.
It is time for Bush and Blair to be thoroughly, independently and judicially investigated for the crimes I suggest have been committed and it is time for the crime of aggression to come into force.
