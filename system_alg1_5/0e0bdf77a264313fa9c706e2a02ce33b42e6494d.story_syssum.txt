The war had helped define Khomeini's regime, the Islamic Republic, which he had founded a year before Saddam Hussein invaded Iran.
Since then, "drinking a chalice of poison" has became part of Iranian political lexicon, and many analysts have asked whether Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Khomeini's successor, would raise the chalice and surrender to demands by the West to end Iran's nuclear program.
The agreement reached in Lausanne, Switzerland, however, marks a new chapter in the history of the country.
Another critic, Sadeq Ziba, said in December "the nuclear program has hurt the country more than the war."
Iranian politicians are divided between moderates -- led by President Hassan Rouhani, who wants to develop the economy -- and hardliners, who view the deal as a threat to the regime's ideology.
So far, the regime has presented the deal as a win for itself.
He has not drunk the poison yet, not until June, when negotiators aim to iron out the final deal.
