Two policemen and several protesters were injured, and four people were arrested.
On Friday, Egyptian Vice President Mahmoud Mekki told CBC, a private Egyptian TV station, that Morsy would consider postponing the referendum, so long as there are no legal challenges to the postponement.
"(They) will not escape punishment," the president said in a televised speech.
And minutes after the speech ended, the Muslim Brotherhood headquarters in Cairo was "ablaze," state TV reported, citing witnesses.
The National Salvation Front, an umbrella group of opposition organizations, called for large-scale demonstrations against a government it says has "lost legitimacy," said the group, as reported by the semiofficial al-Ahram newspaper.
During an interview with Al-Arabiya, an Arabic news network, ElBaradei called on Morsy to postpone the referendum vote and to "rescind the constitutional declaration."
"It's exactly the same battle," said Hasan Amin, a CNN iReporter.
A November 22 edict by Morsy, in which he made his decisions immune to judicial oversight until a new constitution is voted upon, set off the latest wave of political unrest.
Beyond the popular unrest, Morsy's inner circle was shaken when Rafik Habib, the deputy head of the Freedom and Justice Party, resigned Thursday, party spokesman Ahmed Sobe said.
And 11 organizations representing lawyers, journalists, writers, actors, musicians and tour guides said Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood were behind the violence, al-Ahram reported.
CNN's Saad Abedine, Michael Pearson, Karen Smith, Amir Ahmed, and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy also contributed to this report.
