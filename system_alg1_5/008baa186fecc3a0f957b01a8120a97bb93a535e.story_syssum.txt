The incident occurred at the Lubbock, Texas, airport.
However, "TSA has reviewed the procedures themselves and agrees that they need to be changed," the statement said.
"Last time that I checked, a nipple was not a dangerous weapon."
"Ms. Hamlin did not want to remove her nipple piercings," Allred said, reading from a letter she sent TSA.
The officers insisted that Hamlin remove the nipple rings, Allred said.
"She felt humiliated by the scene that the TSA officers were making," Allred said.
"As Ms. Hamlin struggled to remove the piercing, behind the curtain she could hear a growing number of predominately male TSA officers snickering in the background," Allred said in the letter.
She offered to remove it, Allred said, but an officer told her it was not necessary because he could see it.
"I felt surprised, embarrassed, humiliated and scared.
"People who are pierced should not be snickered at, should not become the object of ridicule, should not be singled out for special and uneven and unequal treatment," Allred said.
The next time she visits her great-uncle, she said, "I will be driving."
