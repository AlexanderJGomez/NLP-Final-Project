Unsurprisingly, Russia has attempted to depict China's position as more supportive than it actually is.
"We respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine."
To be sure, there is no love lost between China and Russia.
For more than two decades, Moscow has been Beijing's major supplier of military equipment, some of which has been instrumental in the modernization of the People's Liberation Army, while China also relies on Russia to satisfy its huge thirst for energy, and has been the main beneficiary of the Russian Eastern Siberia -- Pacific Ocean oil pipeline.
China has supported Russia in its sphere of influence, such as in the Syrian crisis, expecting that Russia would support China's interests in Asia, on issues such as North Korea.
"China has significant interest in Ukraine's future stability," added Haenle.
"Ukraine will need China's economic cooperation, whether it's a friend of the EU and the U.S., or of Russia," said Wenfang Tang, of the University of Iowa.
"Meanwhile, facing greater pressure and potential sanctions from the West, Russia will be happy to strengthen its relationship with China."
