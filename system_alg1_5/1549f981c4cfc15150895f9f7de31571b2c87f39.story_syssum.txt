"I think the celebratory tone of it makes it my favorite show to host," says Harris, who previously celebrated Broadway's biggest night with successful hosting gigs in 2009 and 2011.
"I'm really trying this year to figure out a way to get performances by plays somehow in the show," Harris tells EW.
"The more content I end up doing, then the less time everyone gets to spend watching performances, and really, in addition to doling out awards, that's the reason you watch," says Harris, who last year sang a duet with Hugh Jackman, a group performance with the New York Philharmonic cast of "Company" and a full opening and closing number.
As we count down the days until we can see what NPH has up his sleeve at the Tony Awards, we'll just have to make do with his opening number from last year.
