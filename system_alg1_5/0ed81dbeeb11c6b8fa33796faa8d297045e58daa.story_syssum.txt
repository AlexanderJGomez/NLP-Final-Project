The Transportation Security Administration "has initiated action to remove the individual from federal service," an agency spokesperson said.
"This is what TSA will do when they inspect a bag you checked and find a, um, 'personal item,' " she wrote.
"TSA views the handwritten note to be highly inappropriate and unprofessional and apologizes for this unfortunate incident," the spokesperson said.
"It's easy to scapegoat one individual here, but the problem with the note is that it's representative of the bigger privacy intrusions that the U.S. government, through the TSA and other sources, levels every day," she wrote Wednesday after learning of the employee's suspension.
I would much prefer a look at why 'security' has been used to justify so many intrusions on our civil liberties, rather than fire a person who made a mistake."
