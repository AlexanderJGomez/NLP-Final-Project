Nway prepares for her new job, selling vegetables from her aunt's garden.
She became, according to a CNN story, the "girl who refuses to remember."
"After all of her pain and loss, she really is a spunky girl," said Sitko, who works with World Vision International, a humanitarian group.
Nway's resilience is shared by many in Myanmar, aid workers say.
"Most of the people are going back to their livelihoods," Marina said.
"Everyone is hoping that this is the moment that it turns around," Sitko said.
In Nway's village, 120 people out of a population of 430 people lost their lives.
"When I walked to my aunt's house that day, my legs were scratched, and I passed lots of dead bodies," Nway said.
"I wanted to help, because everyone was working, but I was too scared, so I only helped clean up my auntie's yard."
"I'm always the fastest runner," she told Sitko.
"She was very proud," Sitko said.
"I was expecting a very different girl," Sitko said.
I think she's been really transformed by our experience."
