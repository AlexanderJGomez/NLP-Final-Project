Forstall, a senior vice president in charge of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS, will act as an adviser to CEO Tim Cook until departing some time next year, according to a news release from the company.
"He was as close to Steve as anybody at the company," Andy Miller, former head of Apple's iAd group, told Businessweek last year.
John Browett, Apple's head of retail, is also leaving, according to the release.
Monday's changes, particularly Forstall's departure, came as a major surprise.
"The amazing products that we've introduced in September and October, iPhone 5, iOS 6, iPad mini, iPad, iMac, MacBook Pro, iPod touch, iPod nano and many of our applications, could only have been created at Apple and are the direct result of our relentless focus on tightly integrating world-class hardware, software and services."
Forstall has been with Apple since 1997 and, in addition to guiding iOS, is one of the original architects of the company's desktop and laptop software, Mac OS X.
