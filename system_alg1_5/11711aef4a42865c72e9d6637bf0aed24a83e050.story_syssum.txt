(CNN) -- On Sunday, November 2, it will again be the end of Daylight Saving Time.
The U.S. government started moving into and out of "Daylight Saving Time" during World War I to copy the Germans, who said they were doing it to save fuel.
Two states, Arizona and Hawaii, already keep their clocks the same all year long.
First, the U.S. Department of Energy issued a report in 2008 that examined the impact of extended Daylight Saving Time.
But you haven't, and neither have I.
The state House voted to approve the measure, HB340, but it didn't go anywhere in the Senate.
With Arizona and Hawaii already in, that adds up to two-thirds, or 33, states.
In short, it's about time.
