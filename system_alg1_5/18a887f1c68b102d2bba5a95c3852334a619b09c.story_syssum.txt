"I will not stand by while the children of Chicago are played as pawns in an internal dispute within a union," Emanuel said.
As of Sunday, though, Lewis said a "clear majority" of union delegates did not want to suspend the strike given the proposed contract.
"They are not happy with the agreement," Lewis said.
Lewis, from the teachers union, said that one problem is that "there's no trust" of school board members.
The tentative contract would change it for first time since 1967, taking into account "student growth (for the) first time," according to the school system.
In addition, "highly rated teachers" who lost their jobs when their schools were closed can "follow their students to the consolidated school," according to a summary of the proposed contract from Chicago Public Schools.
But Vitale said that he, like the mayor, is "extremely disappointed" that such programs are necessary.
