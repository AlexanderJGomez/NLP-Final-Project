"Ghost Protocol," the fourth entry in the action franchise, has now cumulatively tallied $134.1 million, surpassing the final gross of "Mission: Impossible III" ($134 million).
The original "Sherlock Holmes," by comparison, had earned $165.2 million by this point.
In other words, the first "Sherlock Holmes" started out of the gate much quicker, but "Shadows" is picking up steam.
The same holds true for "Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked," which jumped an incredible 45 percent for $18.3 million.
Finally, in fifth, was David Fincher's "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo," which rose 28 percent for $16.3 million.
In limited release, "The Iron Lady," starring Meryl Streep as former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, debuted to an outstanding $221,800 at four theaters -- that's a per-location average of $55,450.
