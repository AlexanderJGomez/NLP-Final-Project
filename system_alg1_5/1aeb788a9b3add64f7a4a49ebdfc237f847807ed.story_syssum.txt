The pilot, identified as Marcus Schrenker, 38, later checked into a hotel in Alabama under a fake name and then put on a black cap and fled into woods, authorities in Alabama said, according to the Santa Rosa County Sheriff's Office in Milton, Florida.
The plane crashed Sunday night in a swampy, wooded area within 50 to 75 yards of some homes in East Milton, Florida, the sheriff's office said.
The judge's asset-freezing order, which applies to Schrenker's wife and his three companies, is aimed at protecting investors, Gavin said.
Schrenker "appears to have intentionally abandoned the plane after putting it on autopilot over the Birmingham, Alabama, area and parachuting to the ground" Sunday night, the sheriff's office said in a news release.
The plane had been scheduled to land in Destin, Florida, authorities said.
Meanwhile, Schrenker reportedly was more than 220 miles north of the crash site.
The Childersburg police didn't know about the plane crash, so they took Schrenker to a nearby hotel, authorities said.
He was not there, they said.
"The FBI is looking into the matter, along with other agencies," said Paul Draymond with the Birmingham, Alabama, FBI office.
Darlington described the pilot as "accomplished" and said he owns "a couple of airplanes" and flies regularly.
