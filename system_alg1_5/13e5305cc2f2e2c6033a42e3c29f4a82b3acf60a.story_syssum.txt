Inside the concert hall, Jahid Mohseni, a 38-year-old Afghan-Australian media mogul, tries to manage the chaos he's created.
This is a commercial enterprise, and it's reflecting what people want," Mohseni said.
In Afghanistan, more than 60 percent of the population is younger than 25, and judging by the popularity of "Afghan Star," "they're like people everywhere.
Afghanistan's guardians of Islamic values, the Ulema Council, protested that "Afghan Star" and Tolo TV's popular Indian soap operas were not part of Afghan culture.
"You just have to sit down with your critics and explain that if we don't have Afghan music and entertainment, Bollywood will take over," he said.
Mohseni said that "Afghan Star" pushes his country forward in subtle ways, for instance teaching a few valuable lessons in democracy.
"This is the educational component of our show, and hopefully it'll rub off on our politicians," Mohseni said.
