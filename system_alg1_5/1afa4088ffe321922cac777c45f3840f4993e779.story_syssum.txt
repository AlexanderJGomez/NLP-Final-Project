Music preservationist Curtis Blues works the streets of Old Town Alexandria, Virginia.
"This is a one-string diddley bow," Blues says as he picks up a crude, homemade instrument constructed from items you might find in any kitchen.
Blues is a Mississippi Delta Blues preservationist.
So I was exposed to some of the old blues men, and I fell in love with it," Blues says.
He adds: "So it's a preservation of an era, a moment in history, and a style of performance.
"They performed in settings just like this on the side of the river," Blues says of the old-time blues musicians.
One of Blues' "busking" techniques is to get the kids involved.
Near the end of the song, Blues lowers the music and addresses the crowd.
"And that little one there," he goes on, "he eats the most out of all of them."
"Part of my job out here is not only to perform the art, but to educate the public to support the art," Blues explains.
Blues says he will play on the street "as long as there are people here to stop and listen."
