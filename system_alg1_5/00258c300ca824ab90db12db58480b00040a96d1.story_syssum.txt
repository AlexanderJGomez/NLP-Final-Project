In response to the campaign, authorities deployed heavy security along major thoroughfares, especially in Wangfujing, a busy shopping street in downtown Beijing that had been designated by the online group for protests.
Saturday's protest is an annual event organized by the Hong Kong Alliance, a pro-democracy group.
The soldiers, on strict orders to clear the square of demonstrators, had forced their way through the city's main thoroughfare.
