An inaugural grand prix in New Jersey has now been included in the record-breaking 22 race calendar issued by motorsport's global governing body, the FIA, Friday.
Korea, the destination for the next race of this season, has been moved forward to April and has also been given provisional status on the 2014 calendar.
The New Jersey race has already been postponed once, having been initially scheduled for June this year.
The wheels started to come off in August 2012 when Tom Cotter, the president of the race, unexpectedly resigned.
The race will be held at the Red Bull Ring, which staged the Austrian Grand Prix between 1970 and 1987 in its former guise as the Osterreichring.
The deal known as the Concorde Agreement effectively splits the sport's commercial revenues between the governing body, Ecclestone's group and the teams.
