Greece's long land and maritime boundaries, its proximity to Turkey, the explosion of illegal migration from Syria and the country's dire financial situation make it an inviting hub for jihadist groups, according to multiple counterterrorism sources.
The man, who has not been named, has protested his innocence.
-- Last year, two French jihadists were arrested after using Greek soil to return home.
"Greece is not a target, just a gateway into Europe and a stop on the fighters' return home," said the source close to Greek intelligence.
"We estimate that about 2,000 people have used Greece in the last two years or so, mainly arriving by boat from Italy, as a stop to an onward journey," the source close to the intelligence services told CNN.
Coming in the other direction, the number of migrants trying to reach Europe illegally has soared since Syria's implosion, especially by sea.
Figures from the European Union's border agency, Frontex, show that 270,000 people tried to enter Europe illegally in 2014 -- with huge increases in the numbers setting off across the central and eastern Mediterranean.
"The country urgently needs a Department of Homeland Security in order to coordinate the intelligence-sharing among the Greek intelligence service (NIS-EYP), anti-terrorism squad intelligence unit" as well as police, coastguard and military intelligence, Nomikos says.
In the wake of the Paris attacks this month, Federica Mogherini, the European Union's foreign policy chief, promised better intelligence sharing across the EU and with affected Arab states to tackle terrorism.
