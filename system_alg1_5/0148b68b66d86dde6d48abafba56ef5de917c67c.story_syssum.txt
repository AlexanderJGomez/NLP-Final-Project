Meet hitchBOT, a talking, tweeting, bucket-bodied Canadian robot that's hitchhiking west from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Victoria, British Columbia -- a journey of nearly 4,000 miles.
Its travels are being documented on Twitter, on Instagram and on the robot's website, which charts its progress on a map.
"People seem to be rather intrigued with hitchBOT, and take very good care (of it)," said Smith, a communications and multimedia professor at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, and Zeller, a communications professor at Ryerson University in Toronto, in a statement e-mailed to CNN.
hitchBOT has a bucket for a torso, blue swimming-pool noodles for arms and legs and a smiling LED panel for a face, protected by a cake saver.
For these cases, we came up with the solution to let hitchBOT simply chatter away," its creators said.
hitchBOT's final destination is the Open Space artist center in Victoria, British Columbia, which means the robot will likely have to hitch a ride on a boat.
"We have seen so much support on social media and through other channels that we are now more optimistic," they said.
"They (the robot's drivers) all say that wherever they go with hitchBOT, they meet lots of people through it.
