We at Greenpeace, along with the activist group Yes Men, are behind the Shell Oil website ArcticReady.com, which we created to call attention to the company's Arctic destruction.
But mispresentation is Wolpe's concern, which is why he should have addressed the ethics of Shell's multibillion-dollar international hoax perpetrated on Earth itself.
The Shell fleet's 14,000-ton drill ship in Alaska, the Discoverer, slipped anchor two weeks ago.
An oil spill response barge, the Arctic Challenger, which Shell promised the U.S. Coast Guard was "Arctic ready," is in Washington state, beset with technical problems.
We came up with ArcticReady.com.
And when people realize it's a parody, they like it even more.
People clearly want an opportunity to tell Shell what they think of the company's Arctic drilling program, and our site has provided them with a voice.
That's fine.
Let's go.
