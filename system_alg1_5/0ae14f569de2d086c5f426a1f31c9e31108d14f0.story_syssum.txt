She didn't notice she was pulling into a Delta employee parking lot, where she said she was waved through two security checkpoints and allowed to park.
"Here I was sitting in the middle of the C Terminal without having to go through security or do anything," Reynolds said.
The airport employee who let her into the secure area told her to go downstairs and go through security as she normally would, Reynolds said.
"We have taken aggressive action with our security vendors at the parking lot to emphasize that all security procedures, especially verification of credentials, are strictly adhered to," said Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant in a statement.
