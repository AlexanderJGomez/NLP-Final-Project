Binno's lawsuit counters that the LSAT is the only widely used, commercially available exam for assessing law school applicants, leaving, in effect, no alternative.
The Law School Admissions Council, a private not-for-profit group based in Newtown, Pennsylvania, administers more than 100,000 LSATs annually, according to its website.
Before 1997, law schools could decide whether blind people must take the exam, according to Binno's lawyer, Richard Bernstein, who is also blind.
At the end of the day, blind people can't draw.''
"I want the American Bar Association to stop telling blind people that they have to draw pictures in order to go to law school," Binno said.
