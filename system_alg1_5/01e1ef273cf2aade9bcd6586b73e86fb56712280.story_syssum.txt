"It has been an incredible journey and I would like to thank all the fans, team mates and individuals involved with AS Monaco, Juventus, Arsenal FC, FC Barcelona, the New York Red Bulls and of course the French National Team that have made my time in the game so special," he said on his official Facebook page.
Henry's move to Arsenal in 1999, after a troubled year in Turin with Juventus, saw him reunited with former Monaco coach Arsene Wenger.
Henry left Arsenal in 2007 and headed to Barcelona, where more titles lay in wait.
"I don't know if I can be a good coach or not, but the desire is there," he told Sky.
