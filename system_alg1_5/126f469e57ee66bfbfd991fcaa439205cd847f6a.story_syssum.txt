"It was a nightmare," said Joseph, who was then 23 years old and later found it nearly impossible to find where her daughter's remains were buried.
"For years and years, I didn't even know where to look," she said.
"For 33 years, I've been trying to find where my child is," said Joseph, who said her baby's official burial records were missing.
"I started the Hart Island Project having lost a number of friends to AIDS in the 1980s," Hunt said.
She is also founder of The Hart Island Project, a nonprofit organization largely dedicated to informing the public of the island's inhabitants.
But in Gotham, where some 50,000 deaths are reported each year, about 1,200 unknowns are buried on Hart Island, according to New York's Department of Correction.
"I knew," she said, and she pressed her parents until they eventually told her about Anthony.
"As a twin, you're born together, but you don't die together."

Joseph's case, in which records were incomplete, was among the exceptions.
"She is helping so many people and she doesn't know any of us," Russo said of Hunt.
Hunt, who sustains the Hart Island Project largely through donations and sales of her documentary and artwork, says she's recently received a grant from the state's Council on the Arts to create a "posthumous Wiki" -- a user-generated database of stories, photos and information about those on Hart Island.
