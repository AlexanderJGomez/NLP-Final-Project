A few weeks later, Loretta Lynch moved into her new digs down the hall.
She is not a well-known figure, even in New York.
She is a workhorse, not a show horse, and she has flourished doing the hard, ordinary work of federal prosecution -- narcotics cases, organized crime (always big in Brooklyn), public corruption (ditto) and civil rights violations.
Like Holder, she comes from the generation after the civil rights movement, but it is part of her DNA, and that will come through in her priorities.
Holder moved carefully but steadily to reduce federal prosecutions of low-level narcotics offenses, especially marijuana.
This area offers a possible route for cooperation with some Republicans, like Sen. Rand Paul, who were sympathetic to Holder on this issue.
