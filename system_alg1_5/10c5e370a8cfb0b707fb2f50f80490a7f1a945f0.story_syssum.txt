"People thought it was not possible to break the monopoly of the existing company that was there, because it has been there for 80 years," says Karanja, who launched her company's first beer product, called Summit, in 2008.
"People thought it was normal for us to have only one company in this country," she adds.
But instead of bowing out of the industry, Karanja came up with a new product.
"If we support one another, we Kenyans, we Africans, we'll be able to do even bigger than what the multinationals can do."
Karanja, a mother of four, says that startups are common in Kenya, but few survive the harsh business environment.
"I felt good, not because of me, but because of our people here," she explains.
