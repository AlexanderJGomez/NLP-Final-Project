As a family physician, I have seen the devastating effects of losing health insurance.
The first, if it eventually prevails, would not allow about 4.5 million people who gained subsidized insurance in the federal exchanges to get financial assistance.
Without health insurance to pay for this costly test, he postponed it while waiting for financial assistance to help him buy health insurance coverage.
Health insurance saves lives.
Without health insurance, Americans have significantly more unmet health care needs and higher rates of delayed care.
Let's keep moving forward with covering the uninsured in this country, there's no time to waste.
If your answer to either or both of these questions is "no," then we should stop asking whether insurance matters and move forward toward insuring every American.
And, the U.S. health care system has plenty more problems in need of immediate and urgent attention, including the primary care workforce shortage, the unsustainable costs of care and the disparities in health care access.
