On Tuesday, Cohan, an OB-GYN and a mother of two, went into surgery to have her breasts removed.
In the six-minute video, Cohan and her team dance to Beyonce's hit single "Get Me Bodied."
"My fantasy is for you to play the song ... and dance wherever you happen to be," Cohan wrote on her CaringBridge site.
The UCSF Medical Center at Mount Zion says Cohan was discharged from the hospital on Wednesday.
