From 9:30 a.m. until 11 p.m., six days a week, the 50-year-old massage therapist works out of a dingy parlor in Beijing's Xicheng District.
Han is blind, and his life is similar to the roughly 120,000 blind massage therapists in China today, according to a 2012 report by Changchun University.
"It's fairly meaningless," said Hallett.
When they are educated at all, blind people are shoved into segregated schools that are isolated from the rest of society.
"It's a kind of apartheid," said Hallett.
"We're not required to finish everything," said Ni Zhen, a former student of the Qingdao School for the Blind.
"It's not fair that blind people have so few opportunities," said an official from the association who requested anonymity.
"It's a pity that it didn't come out earlier," he said.
