Like a football or basketball game, a host can't "win" "SNL" with a great opening monologue, but he or she sure can screw it up.
But whatever it is, it can't be boring.
The electorate rescued Seth MacFarlane to join our final five: Martin Short, Justin Timberlake, Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig and Ben Affleck.
I mean, it's possible they were terrified underneath, but once the show began, all six of them were giggly and daring and totally committed.
It helps, of course, if you think CK is a comic genius, but even if you're not tuned in to his brand of comedy, his first time hosting had a refreshingly off-beat vibe.
The monologue was a seven-minute stand-up bit on helping an ancient, disoriented Old World lady get to her airplane on time, and the show wrapped up with the original "Last Call" sketch, co-starring Kate McKinnon.
On "SNL," he sang, he provided voices, he mimicked celebrities.
With those out of the way, he should be even freer and more unpredictable the next time he visits.
For a few seconds, I was sweating for him.
But if it was the writers, then bully for them.
Timberlake's episode, which featured him being inducted into the exclusive Five-Timers Club, had the look and feel of a coronation.
(You know the saying, always a "Bridesmaid ...") But she's certainly now on the short list of essential hosts, along with Timberlake, Fallon, Wiig, Zach Galifianakis and Jon Hamm (who by the way, despite popping up for frequent cameos lately, hasn't hosted since 2010).
Thanks again for voting throughout the year, and congratulations to Justin Timberlake, Mr. Saturday Night 2013.
