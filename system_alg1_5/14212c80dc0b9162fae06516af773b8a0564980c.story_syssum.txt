"It depends on who" wins the elections, the president told the Times.
"I don't consider it an appropriate statement for a head of state," said the former Tlaxcala governor.
"The president didn't say anything that hasn't been said before, particularly the permissibility, the inaction and omissions that have weakened the institutions of our country," Blake Mora said.
His statement, made in February, was widely quoted by Mexican newspapers.
Pressed on whether Calderon was accusing the PRI as a whole, Blake Mora said that "it's false that the president has accused the PRI as an institution.
"That's why we're working on a new dynamic, a new platform which will strengthen the institutions of our country," he said.
