Kingston, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Two weeks ago, a growth was found on the chest of Sara Polcari's 6-year-old dog, Charlie.
" Polcari said.
But now, they didn't know what to do.
"It's to prevent dogs from being surrendered to shelters or euthanized when their owners cannot afford care," said Marlo Manning, who founded Fairy DogParents.
"I've never had to choose between caring for my dogs or caring for myself," said Manning, 39.
Get through this, and we'll help you.'
She and her husband adopted their first dog, Ladybug, from a shelter in 2005, when Ladybug was 10 years old.
"Having gone through a job loss myself, I thought: 'I'm really glad that we had Ladybug when we did, because we were able to afford it.
With the veterinarian's help, she donated them to another dog owner in need.
"With Ladybug, her remains by my side ... within seconds, I melted into a puddle and couldn't stop crying.
"I had such a hole in my heart; I had to fill it," Manning said.
"Because (Ladybug) came from a shelter, it had two meanings for me.
"The money is given directly to the vet or pharmacy," Manning said.
"A lot of the people that we sponsor ... have already lost so much that the one thing they try to hang on to is their dog," Manning said.
And the dog, to them, is some sort of normal or a tie to a happier time.
This dog is with its family and never had to go into a shelter," Manning said, beaming.
The dog doesn't even know we exist, and we're just making sure it gets to the ball."
