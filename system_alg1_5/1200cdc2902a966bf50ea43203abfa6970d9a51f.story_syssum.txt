"We want citizens to confront the blindness of politicians and their interests as much in the United States as in Mexico," says Sicilia, who became one of Mexico's most prominent activists after his son's slaying in March 2011.
"It will not be easy to cross the cultural divide to discuss subjects like drug legalization, the illegal production and sale of weapons, trafficking of migrants and money laundering," Sicilia says.
After his son's death, Sicilia said he would no longer write poetry.
"I think that our main accomplishment was to put victims in the center of politics, to say, 'These are not collateral damages.
They are human beings,' " Sicilia says.
"I think that's because a lot of poetry is misinterpreted or simply isn't heard," Sicilia says.
After these cumulative experiences, Sicilia says he feels deceived.
The war does not exist," Sicilia says.
Now, after more than a year of protests, Sicilia says this caravan could be his last.
