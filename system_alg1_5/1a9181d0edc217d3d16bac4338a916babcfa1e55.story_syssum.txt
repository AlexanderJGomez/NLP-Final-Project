In an eerily similar incident in May 2004, former Springbok rugby player Rudi Visagie was awoken by his wife, who heard a car in their driveway in Nelspruit, South Africa.
"I heard Rudi growling," his wife, Frieda Visagie, said.
Their daughter, Marle Visagie, 19, was in the driver's seat.
"It's my daughter, it's my husband, what's going to happen now," his wife said.
"I can tell him, I feel with you," Visagie said.
Though free pending trial, the man nicknamed "the Blade Runner" has to meet various bail conditions, including giving up alcohol, his passport and can't go near an airport, a judge ruled.
People in such situations go through a lot of emotions, including fear, anger and helplessness, Frieda Visagie said.
And should he need to talk, Visagie said, he is ready to help.
