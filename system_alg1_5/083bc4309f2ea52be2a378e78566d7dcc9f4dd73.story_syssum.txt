The ground beef products being recalled have a "sell by date" or a "best if used by date" between September 25, 2007, and September 25, 2008, Topps' statement said.
Tuesday, the company announced a recall of about 331,000 pounds of hamburger meat, according to the USDA.
"Topps is continuing to work with the USDA, state departments of health, retailers and distributors to ensure the safety of our consumers.
The company said to avoid E. coli, consumers should wash hands thoroughly after handling the beef.
The products, all ground beef patties and hamburgers with various brand names, were distributed mainly in the northeastern United States, but went to retailers in many other areas of the country as well, Williams said.
