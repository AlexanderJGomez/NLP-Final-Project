"There doesn't seem to be a real coherent plan to help them," said Jolie, speaking in an exclusive interview with CNN's Arwa Damon Thursday.
A goodwill ambassador for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Jolie wants to find ways to help the agency be more active inside war-torn Iraq.
"How Iraq settles in the years to come is going to affect the entire Middle East," said Jolie.
In August, Jolie first visited Iraq and Syria to get a sense of the problem.
Jolie said it was crucial that the government prepare a plan to deal with refugees who return home from Syria and Jordan and find that their homes are "occupied" by others or "bombed out."
"I have to believe there are people working toward that goal," she said.
It is also attempting to help 41,000 non-Iraqi refugees in Iraq, such as Palestinians and Iranians.
