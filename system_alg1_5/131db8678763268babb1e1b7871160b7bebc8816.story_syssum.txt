The psychiatrist said he questioned Hinckley in November about being dishonest about his activities, and that Hinckley minimized it and called it "nitpicking."
He said Hinckley maintained he never looked at those books.
Dr. Patterson, the former director of forensic psychiatry at St. Elizabeths, told the court he opposes allowing any expansion of Hinckley's trip beyond 17 days and said the unaccompanied time should end.
Patterson said Hinckley lied to his parents and psychiatrists prior to the 1981 Reagan shooting.
Barry Levine, a lawyer for Hinckley, has said the main issue is whether Hinckley is dangerous and that no evidence has been presented to show that he is.
