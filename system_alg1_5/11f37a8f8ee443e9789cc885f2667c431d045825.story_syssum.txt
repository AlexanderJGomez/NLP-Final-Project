"The Obama campaign was following the old playbook of giving a lot of stuff to groups that they hoped they could get to vote for them and be motivated to go out to the polls, specifically the African-American community, the Hispanic community and young people," Romney said during the conference call.

Mitt, last I checked, the Affordable Care Act is for all Americans.
Mitt, you got 59% of those voters.
See, if you accept Romney's theory that minorities were a prime reason he lost, then he should have cleaned up in the Electoral College in those really, really, really white states.
Bobby Jindal, a fellow Republican, had to smack Romney for his ignorant comments: "I absolutely reject that notion," he said.
Mitt, your message was arrogant and dismissive.
Well, Mitt, America should be thankful minorities and young people rejected your nonsense.
