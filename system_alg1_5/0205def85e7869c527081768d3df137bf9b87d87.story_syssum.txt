After all, weight issues crop up in media constantly.
We know how people gain weight, and we think we know how to lose it.
Many more are overweight.
It turns out that studies don't show that's the case.
But I've found myself telling my kids again and again that what's shown on TV isn't the best way to lose weight.
But studies show that, on their own, eating more of them without making other behavioral changes doesn't result in any weight loss.
In general, people compensate for snacking throughout the rest of the day.
They show that significant physical activity can help with weight loss, and that it has the added bonus of making you healthier in general.
Over the past five years, my wife and I have lost quite a bit of weight.
My breakfast consists of just coffee, I eat very light lunches, such as salads, and dinner is usually a healthy home-cooked meal with the family.
I tell you this because more and more, I think that the journey to sustained weight loss is a very personal and individual path.
That has to start when kids are young, and it's a lifelong journey.
