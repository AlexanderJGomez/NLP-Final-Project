In his plea agreement, Masri said that on July 19, 2010, he told an associate he "wanted to travel to a conflict zone to engage in jihadist fighting" and that he had the choice of going to Afghanistan to help al Qaeda or travel to Somalia to aid Al-Shabaab.
Masri agreed, according to the plea agreement.
Masri told his associate that once they left for Somalia they would be "wanted men."
Masri was arrested when he left the store.
