... Enacting a data-roaming rule would be politically expedient for FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski, who has faced legal setbacks in his quest to make wireless networks more open."
Taking the carriers' side against the FCC in this fight are some powerful politicians -- most notably Florida congressman Cliff Stearns, the ranking Republican on the House Communications, Technology and the Internet Subcommittee.
If a vote on the data-roaming proposal appears on that agenda, the FCC might be able to get this rule approved under the wire, increasing its ability to pursue its net neutrality plans, before a more hostile Congress moves in.
