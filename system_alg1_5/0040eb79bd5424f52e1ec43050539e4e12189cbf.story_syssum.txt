Ripping from the headlines, Warhol adopted Chairman Mao as his subject, applying his signature pop aesthetic to China's paramount leader.
"Mao was front-page news in America and that was often where Warhol got his biggest inspiration," said Eric Shiner, director of Pittsburgh's Andy Warhol Museum, which organized the exhibition.
"It was one of the special places," said Christopher Makos, the artist's close friend and personal photographer, who accompanied him to China.
"He was all about multiples...and at the time, China was the ultimate multiple," Makos said.
"If you don't know who Andy Warhol is, I won't blame you.
"One of the reasons why I wanted to do this show is so the general public can learn about the artist behind these iconic works and realize (Mao and Marilyn Monroe) are just a few of thousands of images he made," he said.
"The curiosity is greater than the awareness," said John Good, international director for post-war and contemporary art at Christie's, which is holding its second private sale of Warhol's work in Hong Kong this week.
However, visitors to the "15 Minutes External" exhibitions in mainland China will not see any Chairman Mao portraits.
While Shiner acknowledged the Mao portraits "could be read as a sarcastic or ironic portrayal", he said Warhol "definitely wasn't being critical.
Warhol's influence on Chinese contemporary art can actually be traced back to 1981, when many contemporary artists, labeled as dissidents, fled the country, Shiner said.
Ai once spotted Warhol at a party, but did not approach him, Shiner revealed.
Maybe (the Chinese) don't know him, but they know his work," Makos said, predicting that Warhol "will get bigger and bigger in China."
"As long as that imagery is live and well, Warhol will have this built-in publicity."
