Darren Prince, Rodman's agent for 16 years, told CNN on Sunday that Kenny Anderson, Cliff Robinson, Vin Baker, Craig Hodges, Doug Christie, and Charles D. Smith would play against the North Korean Senior National Team.
I like the guy, and he's an awesome guy to me," Rodman said.
However, on his last trip, which took place last month less than a week after North Korea announced the execution of Kim's uncle and top aide, Jang Song Thaek, Rodman didn't get to meet Kim.
This is strictly about the game and for the love of basketball," Rodman teammate Vin Baker told CNN at the departure gate, where the players posed for photos with fellow travelers.
"The North Koreans were quite strong, well-built and tall as well," he said.
"On the other hand, North Korea plays some high-quality basketball, so they could learn from his experience."
"What Dennis Rodman is doing now is personal, but I think he's brave for doing it," she told CNN.
