But the outcry over Devyani Khobragade's treatment is drowning out the serious allegations of exploiting her employee, also an Indian national, and the pervasive violations against millions of other domestic workers around the world and in the homes of diplomats in America.
There's no doubt that strip searches, a routine part of U.S. felony arrests, are humiliating.
But the treatment of domestic workers, who number more than 50 million worldwide and are one of every 13 female wage earners, is often even more degrading.
In some cases, they are locked in their workplaces.
Unpaid wages, excessive working hours and physical, sexual and psychological abuse are the most common problems.
As a consular official, Khobragade has limited immunity, which the State Department says does not cover visa fraud, a felony.
It is not just singling out foreign diplomats.
Their treatment is just as important.
