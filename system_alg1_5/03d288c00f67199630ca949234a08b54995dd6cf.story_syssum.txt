(CNN) -- First, there was the war on drugs.
Their point was that Limbaugh may have been bad, but he's not the only one, so he should be forgiven.
Thus, the war on comedy was on.
In any event, Maher and C.K.
To me, the answer depends on two factors.
But still, night after night you will hear material far worse than anything Maher, C.K.
On the other hand, if you're a famous comedian, it's a completely different story.
However, comedians must be afforded great leeway when the joke is about a political issue.
Richard Pryor, Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, Chris Rock and, of course, Jon Stewart, do more than simply make people laugh -- their comedy can shape public opinion.
The reason we tell these jokes is not only to get a laugh, but also to challenge people's views.
We will not only have lost the war on comedy, but also effectively silenced comedians from telling jokes about any controversial political topics or figures.
