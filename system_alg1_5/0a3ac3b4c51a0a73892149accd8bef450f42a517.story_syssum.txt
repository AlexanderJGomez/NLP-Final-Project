Atlanta (CNN) -- The remnants of Tropical Storm Lee settled in over the mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Wednesday, prompting warnings of heavy rain and flash flooding in areas from Washington up to western New England, the National Hurricane Center said.
Earlier Wednesday, the storm caused a series of air traffic delays across the Northeast.
"We could get flooded again," Robin Stewart of Paterson, New Jersey, told CNN affiliate WCBS.
In Gwinnett County, Georgia, just outside Atlanta, firefighters said Tuesday they found the body of a man who drowned in a rain-swollen creek near Norcross.
And a woman was struck by a tree and killed in Chattanooga, Tennessee, early Tuesday.
