The Coast Guard first encountered Baluchi on Wednesday after receiving a report about a man in a bubble off the coast of Miami, disoriented and asking for directions to Bermuda, a Coast Guard press release said.
In the press release, the Coast Guard said Baluchi had protein bars, bottled water, a GPS and a satellite phone.
There were no reported injuries, the Coast Guard said.
"Part of his effort was to make world peace but he got caught up in the Gulf Stream," said Coast Guard public affairs specialist Mark Barney.
"Reza doesn't listen to anyone," Davis Hyslop, a businessman and one of Baluchi's supporters, said in the 2012 story.
But you gotta be a little crazy to undertake such an endeavor, right?"
