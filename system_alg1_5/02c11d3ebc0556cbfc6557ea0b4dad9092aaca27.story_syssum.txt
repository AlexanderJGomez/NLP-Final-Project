When we first started developing antibiotics, such infections were easier to cure.
But over time, the bacteria evolved.
Over time, these bacteria have become harder and harder to treat.
Over time, though, a strain of bacteria, known as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, became a problem in hospitals.
Over time, though, it got out into the community.
These days, though, we pretty much assume it's the cause, and treat with stronger drugs.
Each time we use antibiotics unnecessarily, say to treat a virus, we make the problem worse.
It's much, much more likely, though, that these same people will ask for antibiotics when they get a cold.
That's the kind of thing we need to stop now.
