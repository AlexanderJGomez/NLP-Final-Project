Myles Ulrich is a fan of games such as "Guitar Hero" and "Rock Band," which have spawned a comeback for rock music.
"It's a cool generational thing to share that with your kids," said Ulrich, the drummer for the multi-platinum quartet.
"A few weeks ago, when the game featuring Aerosmith ['Guitar Hero: Aerosmith'] came out, there was more than a 40 percent increase in their catalog sales.
"When 'Death Magnetic' comes out in September, you can actually download the new album the same day it comes out, and play it on your 'Guitar Hero III,' " Ulrich said -- fully aware of the irony, given his band's past litigation with the Internet music file-sharing service Napster.
"You got fans cheering you on," he marveled shyly.
"This is a chance for something that's been a competition to actually be an ally, if you will," he said.
