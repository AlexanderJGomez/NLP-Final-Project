In the meantime, many details remain to be worked out about the Taliban, Psaki said.
To advance peace, the Taliban has chosen, Doha, Qatar, to open an office under the name "Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan."
Karzai was referring to how, during Tuesday's ribbon-cutting in Qatar, a Taliban spokesman said the group would continue its military campaign while at the same time renouncing international terrorism.
U.S. officials, however, view the Taliban office as a good start -- "good news," in fact.
The ability to open a formal line of communication with the Taliban is important to reaching an "end goal" of disassociating the Taliban from al Qaeda and bringing peace to Afghanistan, Psaki said.
We're doing both at the same time, talking and winding down our fighting in the country," Psaki said.
There is a journey to go here," Psaki said.
That U.S. withdrawal raises the stakes for Afghanistan to govern itself in peace.
