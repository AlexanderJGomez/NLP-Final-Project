(CNN) -- This past week, at "town hall" meetings in Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and New Hampshire, a group of Republican senators sounded alarms about disasters that will befall local economies should the threat of more than $500 billion in defense cuts over the next decade become a reality in January.
House Republicans, shackled by a tea party ball-and-chain, turned the vote into a heated debate on spending cuts.
But that wasn't all.
In fact, almost no one who voted for this legislation ever thought these cuts would actually be made.
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has repeatedly declared that sequestration defense cuts -- coming on top of the 10-year, $487 billion in defense cuts that start next year -- would have disastrous consequences for our national security.
But it's the investment revenue which has been the deal-breaker for most Republicans.
The generals, admirals and civilian leaders did just that.
Maybe instead of holding political Potemkin town halls in swing states about the dangers that sequestration poses for the Pentagon, we should ask congressional leaders to take lessons from the Pentagon on how to work together to prevent it from happening.
