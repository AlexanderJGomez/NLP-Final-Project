Bellefonte, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Matt Sandusky, one of six adopted children of Jerry Sandusky, said through his attorney Thursday that he was sexually abused by the former Penn State assistant football coach, adding that he had been prepared to testify against him in a high-profile child rape case.
During closing arguments, his defense sought to poke holes in the prosecution's case, pointing to inconsistencies with the testimony of Mike McQueary, a former graduate student and assistant coach who said he saw Sandusky apparently sodomizing a boy in a university shower.
During the arguments, Sandusky's wife, Dottie, was seen quietly crying.
"The commonwealth has overwhelming evidence against Mr. Sandusky," he said.
The prosecution had called its only rebuttal witness Tuesday, to counter testimony that raised questions about Sandusky's mental health.
On Wednesday, the defense called Dr. Jonathan Dranov, an acquaintance of McQueary's, who told jurors that the former assistant coach told him he heard "sexual sounds" and saw the boy in the shower when an arm reached around him but, did not actually see a sexual encounter.
Sandusky then emerged from the shower area, he said.
The witness, the first accuser to take the stand, said Matt Sandusky looked "nervous" when he saw that Jerry Sandusky was about to start a soap fight.
In his 2001 autobiography, "Touched," Jerry Sandusky wrote about his relationship with Matt Sandusky, who he met through Second Mile when the youth was 7 or 8.
"He had the strength and the courage to stay loyal to us even when we weren't sure what would happen," Sandusky wrote.
He could have driven us out of his life, but he didn't.
"When he found out there were others, he was in real misery," Hamilton said, adding Sandusky tried to adopt Weaver.
