"Accidents, of which this was among the worst that I've ever seen, are typically a confluence of circumstances of seemingly unrelated events, which all coalesce to create a disaster," said Arthur Rosenberg, a pilot, engineer and partner in the New York-based law firm, Soberman & Rosenberg.
Prior to departure, the cargo was reinspected, it added.
National Airlines, which specializes in moving freight for the military and businesses, did not immediately return a call asking about whether the pilots had, in fact, performed such a takeoff.
If the takeoff had been rougher than usual, "it could have caused the cargo in the back of the plane to become loose," Rosenberg said.
"The light person is never going to get the heavy person off the ground," he said.
"Upon takeoff, we'll be looking back at the cargo until we get off the ground, making sure none of the chains break or pop out," Airman 1st Class Michael Brown says in the airfield's story.
"There's a lot of trust that we put in our loadmasters," said Capt.
"It's a fantastic plane," he said.
In its statement, National Air Cargo said it "will not speculate as to the cause of the accident," and that it was fully cooperating with authorities as the investigation continues.
