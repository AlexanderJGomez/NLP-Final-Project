Hernandez has been charged with premeditated murder in the death of Odin Lloyd, 27.
Authorities have said Hernandez, 23, and two other men picked Lloyd up from his Boston apartment early on June 17.
Also on Monday, Ernest Wallace, one of two men who police say was in the car with Hernandez the night Lloyd was killed, agreed to be held without bail pending his next hearing.
He pleaded not guilty.
In court papers, Ortiz allegedly told police that the day after Lloyd was killed, he and Hernandez went to a Franklin, Massachusetts, apartment leased by Hernandez.
Ortiz has a status hearing scheduled for Tuesday, but prosecutors say if Ortiz agrees to continue to be held without bail, the hearing will likely be canceled.
