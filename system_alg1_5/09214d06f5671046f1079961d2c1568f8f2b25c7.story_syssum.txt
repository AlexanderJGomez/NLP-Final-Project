OhioAmerican Energy, which is a subsidiary of Murray Energy Corporation, issued a statement announcing its coal mining operations near Brilliant, in southeastern Ohio, would be closing five years earlier than expected.
"The president has made clear that coal has an important role in our energy economy today, and it will in the future," Stevens said.
"(That) is why the administration has worked to make sure that, moving forward, we can continue to rely on a broad range of domestic energy sources from oil to gas, to wind and solar, to nuclear, as well as clean coal."
Many of the coal-related regulations being enforced now, he said, are "not really new" -- having been passed, in some form, in 1990 as part of the Clean Air Act.
