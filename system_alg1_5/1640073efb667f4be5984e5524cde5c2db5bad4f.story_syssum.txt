Sherlock Holmes has the Sherlockians, scholars of the canon of books and short stories written by author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
"I liked it a lot more than I thought I would," said Andrew Peck, a United States magistrate judge.
He is observant on his own and Holmes wants him around, not as a bumbling fool but as a trusted aide."
The actors work well together, as did Holmes and Watson.
The plot of the new Sherlock Holmes movie, starring Robert Downey Jr., as Holmes and Jude Law as Watson, isn't based on an actual Conan Doyle story.
For instance, in this film, Watson introduces his fiancee, Mary Morstan, to Holmes for the first time.
"While she was called an adventuress in the story, she was not a criminal by any means, as she is portrayed in this movie," Peck said.
"When William Gillette, working on a Holmes play, asked Doyle if it was OK for Holmes to marry, Doyle is said to have replied, 'You may marry him, or murder him, or do anything you like to him.'
