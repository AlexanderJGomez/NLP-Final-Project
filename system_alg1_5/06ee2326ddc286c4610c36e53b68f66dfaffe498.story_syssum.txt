Breylan and Terese Hicks play with their sons Bryce, 3, and Jordan, 2.
"I've always been looking in this subdivision, but never thought we could afford a home here," Terese Hicks said.
Soon, the family settled in their seven-bedroom, five-bathroom plantation-style home with a pool.
Struggling to pay the new adjusted mortgage, Terese Hicks appealed to their mortgage company, Homecomings which is owned by GMAC, for help.
Desperate, the Hickses asked their mortgage company again for help.
"It's a balancing act, what's in the best interest of the customer and the investor."
The Hicks family's story is one that Marcia Griffin, founder of HomeFree-USA, has heard all too often.
With offices in Washington and Atlanta, HomeFree-USA's clientele is mostly minority borrowers.
"You cannot buy a house without any money, and you cannot buy a house with poor credit," cautioned Griffin.
With a low interest rate locked in for the next five years, the family was able to keep the home and pay an affordable monthly mortgage.
"People don't know where to go and who to talk to," says Griffin.
