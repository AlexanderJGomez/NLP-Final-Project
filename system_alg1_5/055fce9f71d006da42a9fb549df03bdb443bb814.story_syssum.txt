An increase in handmade technology accessories and vintage patterns for clothes are popular, too, as art and craft enthusiasts find new ways to develop their creative talents.
"While we had never actively solicited artwork or crafts from fans, we were seeing so much incredible stuff posted across the web, and were inspired to build 'Coco MoCA - The Museum Of Conan Art' -- an internet gallery to celebrate these fantastic artists' talent," said John A.
Husband and wife team, Stephen and Betsy Carr, of Asheville, North Carolina, said they quit their day jobs to pursue their dream job of selling handmade jewelry on Etsy and couldn't be happier.
"We're creative people and it feels incredibly satisfying to have made this creative life for ourselves," said Betsy.
"Fantasy of any sort is perfect for inspiration and getting creative juices flowing," said Talia Roselli, a spokesperson for Craftster.org.
Crafters will be inspired throughout the year, according to Roselli, to make cases for items like smartphones, iPads and Kindles, to name a few.
"Everytime I plug in my device, it makes me smile," said Brenna.
"It's a beautiful blend of old and new that we're seeing," noted Roselli.
