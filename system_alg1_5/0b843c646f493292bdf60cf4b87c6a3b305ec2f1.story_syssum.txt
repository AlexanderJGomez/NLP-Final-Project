NEW YORK (CNN) -- Pam Biggers, a 52-year-old woman from Hueytown, Alabama, disappeared while on a business trip to the Florida Panhandle.
"It's completely baffling," said her husband, Don Biggers.
There was no sign of struggle, police said.
"We think she may have initially wandered off on her own," Don Biggers said.
The hotel did not have surveillance cameras, so it is not known when Biggers left or whether she was alone.
According to her family, Biggers had never wandered off before, nor had she suffered from memory loss.
Biggers was last seen wearing a white sweater, black pants with white pinstripes, a wedding band and an aquamarine ring.
