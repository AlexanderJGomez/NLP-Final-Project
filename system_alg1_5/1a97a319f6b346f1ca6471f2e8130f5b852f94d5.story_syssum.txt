On the campaign trail during his 2000 presidential run, he argued for "common-sense gun safety measures."
"For many Democrats, it's smart politics not to get into the gun control debate," he said.

"When we're done speaking out, sir, gun owners will have made the difference in key precincts in battleground states," NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre told the organization's meeting in April.
