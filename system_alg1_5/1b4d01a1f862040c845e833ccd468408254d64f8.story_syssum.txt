Matome Mbatha, market manager at Wines of South Africa, said that wine is becoming increasingly popular on the continent but the industry is still in its infancy outside South Africa.
A dry, oaked white wine blend of Semillon, Sauvignon Blanc and Muscat, the Charlevale has hints of fresh gooseberry and an acidic, lemony finish.
The wine is produced high up in Kenya's Rift Valley, thousands of meters above sea level, and is owned by the Kenya Nut Company.
Khadija Madawili, technical manager at SABMiller Tanzania, said the red wine has a smooth, rounded taste and is best with "Nyama Choma," a local delicacy of roasted spiced meat, while the "natural sweet" wine is the perfect complement for light salads or simply enjoyed as an aperitif.
The Dodoma region is home to a number of varieties including Chenin Blanc, Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon and Makutupora, a local dry red.
For something very different, but very traditional, Tej is an East African honey wine, primarily consumed in Ethiopia.
Harry Kloman, an expert on Tej and Ethiopian cuisine, said that there are very few, if any, wineries that produce Tej as the wine tends to be homemade or served in a "Tej Bet," a bar that specializes in the wine.
Tej costs between five to 15 Ethiopian birr (26 cents to 78 cents) locally.
