Nonetheless, the 20-year-old from the St. Louis area has been arrested for the shootings of two police officers during last week's protests in Ferguson, Missouri, a prosecutor said Sunday.
At the time of his arrest, Williams was on probation for receiving stolen property.
One element of the case that authorities have yet to sort out is intent, McCulloch said, adding that Williams has acknowledged firing the shots but has said he wasn't aiming at the police officers.
"It's possible he was firing at someone else," he said, urging any other witnesses with information to come forward.
"In no way are they representative of the thousands of people ... who have been protesting," said Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman.
"These police officers were standing there, and they were shot just because they were police officers," he said.
However, we will not allow, nor tolerate, the destructive and violent actions of a few to disrupt our unifying efforts," the mayor of Ferguson and the City Council said in a statement Sunday.
The other was hit in the shoulder and the bullet came out the middle of his back, Belmar said.
