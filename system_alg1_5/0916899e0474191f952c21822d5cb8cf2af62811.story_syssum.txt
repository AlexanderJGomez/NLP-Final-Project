(CNN) -- Easter is upon us and, like clockwork, hordes of brightly wrapped chocolate bunnies and eggs have begun their domination of supermarket aisles.
Dedicated to all things chocolate, the property's activities include family s'mores roasts, chocolate bingo and plenty of sugary seasonal events such as an annual Easter egg hunt.
The on-site Chocolate Spa offers treatments like the Whipped Cocoa Bath, the Chocolate Bean Polish and the Chocolate Fondue Wrap.
The real sugar rush comes from the Three Ways' special chocolate indulgence package, which includes a box of handmade chocolates, a chocolate-featured snack, dinner and breakfast, a chocolate treasure hunt and, finally, a chocolate cookery demonstration and tasting.
For more than 25 years the dessert extravaganza has served up everything from chocolate croissant bread pudding and truffles to whoopee pies and cocoa-infused martinis, ensuring that no chocolate desire is left unsatisfied.
