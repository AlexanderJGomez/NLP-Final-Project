John Evander Couey, 51, died at 11:15 a.m.
"I never dreamed it would happen like this," Jessica's father, Mark Lunsford, told CNN.
"To me, death is sad," he said.
"I am not shedding any tears," the girl's grandmother, Ruth Lunsford, said on Wednesday.
"I don't feel sorry for him that he had to suffer," she said.
"I know he didn't suffer the way Jessie did when he killed her," Dawsy said.
"Couey's timeline after he kidnapped Jessica Lunsford leaves open the possibility that she was alive, and in the house, at the time of the first and possibly the second interview," according to a prosecution memo in the case.
Howard, at Couey's sentencing, brought many in the courtroom to tears as he discussed how the girl died slowly as her oxygen ran out.
"He caused a slow, suffering, conscious death," Howard said of Couey.
"I kick myself in the butt a hundred times a day," he said.
"No, that was a big problem," Couey said.
"You want to do something for her, give your life for the one you took."
