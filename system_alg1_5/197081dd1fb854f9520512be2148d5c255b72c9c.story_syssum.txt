But Tate officials now say that walking on the artificial seeds, which lay in an inch-thick carpet in the gallery's massive Turbine Hall, has generated more dust than expected.
"In consequence, Tate, in consultation with the artist, has decided not to allow visitors to walk across the sculpture," the statement by Tate Modern said.
Ai's seeds are porcelain, each one individually handcrafted by laborers in the Chinese city of Jingdezhen.
Sunflower seeds are a popular Chinese street snack and one of the country's most famous exports, according to the gallery.
Ai is a well-known and controversial figure in China, probably best-known today for the design -- in collaboration with Herzog & de Meuron -- of Beijing's "Bird's Nest" stadium, built for the 2008 Olympics.
