In a letter last month to Science, 255 of the nation's most prominent scientists -- all members of the National Academy of Sciences, including 11 Nobel laureates -- repeat conclusions that by now should be entirely familiar, even tedious, to anyone who has followed the science at all.
Climate change is a threat to coastal communities, food and water supplies, and ecosystems.
But they are the latest example of a persistent, and worrisome, trend: attacking scientists who have done key work that demonstrates the human impact on climate.
In 1995, a group called Global Climate Coalition, composed of the American Petroleum Institute and a host of fossil-fuel dependent corporations, attacked Benjamin Santer, a scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who had done key work demonstrating the human "fingerprint" on climate.
Perhaps no scientific name is more associated with global warming than Roger Revelle, mentor to Al Gore, who first warned of the risks of human-caused climate change in the 1950s.
He was soon sued by the author of the claim, and lacking funds to defend himself, was forced to settle out of court, leaving his personal and professional life in tatters.
But it isn't just climate scientists who have been vilified, personally attacked, and threatened with lawsuits and congressional investigations.
Deaths from tobacco smoking, environmental destruction from DDT and other pesticides, acid rain and the ozone hole were market failures, too.
On the contrary, they've been repeatedly vindicated in their work on environmental change.
The real crime is that our best science is being undermined by ideologues, confusing us about some of the most important issues of our time.
