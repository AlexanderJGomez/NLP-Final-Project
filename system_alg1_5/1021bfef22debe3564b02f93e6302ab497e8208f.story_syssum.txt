(CNN) -- With her signature Friday on Senate Bill 1070, Gov.
Pete Wilson championed Proposition 187, enacted by voters in November 1994.
Moreover, even though Proposition 187 was never implemented, California suffered other repercussions besides the waste of limited state financial resources.
Coincidentally, Arizona's SB 1070 suffers from many of the same constitutional flaws as California's Proposition 187.
They and other proponents have at various times maintained, in more or less blatant contradiction of their rhetorical defense of the law's constitutional propriety, that SB 1070 is a much-needed change in current law that will strengthen Arizona.
In fact, the pre-enactment characterization more accurately reflects the bill's effects: SB 1070 would dramatically change every Arizonan's daily experience, especially anyone whose appearance, name, language or accent fits the stereotype of the undocumented.
