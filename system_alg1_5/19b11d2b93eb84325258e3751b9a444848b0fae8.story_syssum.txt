Brown, an unarmed black teen, was shot to death by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, on August 9.
According to Ed Magee, spokesman for the prosecuting attorney's office, the grand jury is focused on whether Wilson should be charged with any one of several possible crimes, including first-degree murder, second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter.
If they do, according to Joy, Wilson's sentence could be from five to 15 years.
If found guilty, Joy said, Wilson could be sentenced to no more than seven years in prison.
If the grand jury decided against an indictment, Wilson would continue to be a free man, at least so far as the state's criminal charges.
