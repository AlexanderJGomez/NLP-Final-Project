(CNN) -- Public executions, death by starvation and torture are common in North Korean political prisoner camps, according to testimony given to human rights group Amnesty International.
For decades the authorities have refused to admit to the existence of mass political prison camps," said Sam Zarifi, Amnesty International Asia Pacific Director.
"If you fell sick, there were no meals because you did not produce any output," the report quoted one witness as saying.
They are endemic, they are part of the system."
"An NGO reported that one reeducation center was so crowded that prisoners were forced to sleep on top of each other or sitting up," the report, updated in March, 2010, said.
