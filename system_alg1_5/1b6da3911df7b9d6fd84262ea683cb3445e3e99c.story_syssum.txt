Kathleen Sebelius' nomination to President Obama's Cabinet may focus less on her qualifications than on the issue of abortion, analysts said.
"Sebelius' support for abortion is so far off the charts that she has been publicly criticized by the last three archbishops of Kansas City," Donohue said in a statement.
In May, Archbishop Joseph F. Naumann of Kansas City, Kansas, said that Sebelius' stance on abortion had "grave spiritual and moral consequences."
"I am concerned that the bill is likely unconstitutional, or even worse, endangers the lives of women," Sebelius said in a statement.
Though Sebelius is dogged by many on the religious right, GOP Sens.
"It's a problem, and Sam Brownback has been in long step with them on the abortion issue.
That's a setback for them," he said.
They're ready for a fight," Brody told CNN.
The abortion fight, however, may be one that Obama's team wants to avoid, he said Monday.
"That's the danger here for the Obama administration, to be a distraction."
