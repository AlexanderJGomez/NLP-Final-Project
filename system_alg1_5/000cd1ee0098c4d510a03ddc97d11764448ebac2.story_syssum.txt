If not, there are at most two of the man-eating creatures around, he believes.
Kharel said he feared the actual number of people killed by the leopard could be higher than 15, because others have lost their life to leopard attacks in Uttarkhand state in northern India, which borders Baitadi district.
"It could be the same leopard," he said.
After killing its victim, the leopard takes the body away into the forest to eat.
"We are sending a veterinary doctor to the district to understand the situation," Dhakal, the ecologist, said.
While cases of leopards killing domestic animals are common, and there are sometimes instances of leopards killing people in Nepal, this case is "extreme," Dhakal said.
