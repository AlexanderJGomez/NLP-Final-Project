Officials called the wildfire, which had scorched more than 7,400 acres and continued to burn, the worst in the nation's history.
"It was a horrific scene."
The fire, which began Thursday morning on Mount Carmel and spread through nearby areas, has triggered an outcry in Israel.
"On the way here, we flew over Carmel, where we heard and saw the Greek aircraft fighting the fire," Netanyahu said.
Israeli fire crews were also aided by Cyprus, England and Turkey, among others.
"This is a very blessed step that the prime minister of Turkey has decided to take," Netanyahu told reporters about Turkey's help.
