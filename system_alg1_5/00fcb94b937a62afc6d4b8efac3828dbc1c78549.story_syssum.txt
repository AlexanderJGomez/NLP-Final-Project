The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll, released Tuesday, indicates that only 34 percent feel that current federal lawmakers deserve re-election, with 63 percent saying no.
"This is not a good year to be an incumbent, regardless of which party you belong to," said CNN polling director Keating Holland.
"It's a change from 2006, when voters concentrated their anger at GOP members of Congress."
According to the poll, 44 percent of registered voters say Obama deserves re-election, with 52 percent saying the president does not deserve a second term in office.
The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted Friday through Monday, with 1,023 adult Americans, including 954 registered voters, questioned by telephone.
