(CNN) -- The thing about North Korea is that once in a while, it does something that sends the international community into a flurry of talk about the hermit nation, even though little is known about what's really going on.
Now, the new "Dear Leader" can claim not just a public relations victory but also a tangible accomplishment as he prepared for Monday's anniversary of Kim Jong Il's death.
"It's been an interesting first year but as with most things in North Korea, we simply don't know," he said.
"I think this is very important to Kim Jong Un to build political legitimacy and bolster the spirits of his people," he said.
"Then, it was a major embarrassment," said Han Park, director of the University of Georgia's Center for the Study of Global Issues who was in North Korea at the time of the failed launch.
"The successful launch was the result of Kim's "unique will, courage and boldness," said Jang Chol, head of the State Academy of Sciences.
"Kim Jong Un's primary objective is to improve the economy by participating in the international market," Park said.
"So he realized he has to improve relations with the outside world," Park said.
The Chinese, in particular, have taken advantage of that, Park said.
Sigal said.
"He's saying to the world, 'Look, I'm back,'" Richardson said about Kim Jong Un.
"It's uncertain about the new leader," he said.
And that's not negotiating.
