LONDON, England (CNN) -- For Europe's biggest leagues the football season has ended, the boring business of kicking a ball about is over, and now the real fun can begin as the transfer window opens.
The English Premier League pre-season transfer window opened at midnight on the last day of the season (May 24) and will close on August 31, while in the other big European football nations (including France, Germany Italy and Spain) the transfer window opens on July 1 and closes at the end of August.
When a club is active in the transfer window, making big name buys, it can be taken as a statement of intent for the following season.
Their newly elected club president, billionaire construction magnate Florentino Perez, previously headed the club between 2000 and 2006, when his policy was to bring football's biggest names to Real Madrid.
Then there is Manchester City, funded by the vast oil wealth of the Abu Dhabi United Group.
