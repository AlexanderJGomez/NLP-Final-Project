Beyonce: I grew up in a fabric store.
Tina: And it's funny when you need the clothes they won't loan them to you, and when you don't need them everyone wants to give them to you, so that's how it started but that was very exciting to see the clothes on TV.
Beyonce: Sometimes, but it's very rare.
Tina: I think the holiday collection -- what Beyonce is wearing now.
Beyonce: I don't.
Tina: I think trend-setting woman, confident, has her own style.
Beyonce: It comes from here.
