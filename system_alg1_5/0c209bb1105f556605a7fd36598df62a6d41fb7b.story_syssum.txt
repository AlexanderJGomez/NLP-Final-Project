Here's why.
The EU is Russia's largest trading partner, and there are deep economic links between the two.
Russia, in turn, is the third biggest trading partner for the EU, with $169 billion in imports.
Germany, the eurozone's biggest economy, imports around 40% of its gas from Russia.
On the flip-side, the U.S. is Russia's fifth largest partner, with just $11 billion worth of trade.
"Russia's angry response to the act shows that it works," Clark said.
But again, the financial links between Russia and the west would mean huge losses for European banks which have lent billions to Russia.
At the end, targeting Russia's national pride may prove more useful.
"A decision by a large group of countries to boycott the 2018 Football World Cup in Russia would probably hurt Russian prestige rather more, especially if FIFA had to move the event to another country," David Clark said.
