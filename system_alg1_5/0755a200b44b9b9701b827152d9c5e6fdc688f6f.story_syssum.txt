Cameron's former director of communications Andy Coulson is among eight journalists facing charges, as is Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of Murdoch's News International.
Coulson and Brooks are former editors of the defunct Murdoch tabloid the News of the World, which was shut down last year in the face of public outrage at the hacking scandal.
Cameron's office and News International declined to comment, as did McCartney and a number of other celebrities named as potential victims.
Five other journalists were charged, the Crown Prosecution Service announced, while three will not be prosecuted.
Private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, who is suspected of carrying out the hacking, is also among the eight.
She quit News International, the British newspaper publishing arm of News Corp., amid the scandal last summer.
The Met Police continues to investigate claims of phone hacking in their investigation, known as Operation Weeting.
In fact, the messages had been accessed by a private investigator working for News of the World, Dowler's father, Bob, told the inquiry panel.
CNN's Dan Rivers, Jonathan Wald and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.
