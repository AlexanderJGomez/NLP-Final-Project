Anthony, 25, was acquitted July 5 of murder and child neglect charges in the death of her daughter, Caylee, whose skeletal remains were found in 2008 in a wooded field.
"If her attorneys are doing the right thing and are doing their jobs, they're going to have to explain to her that there is real hatred out there for her, that there have been death threats, that she cannot just walk amongst the population," HLN legal contributor Sunny Hostin said.
When exactly Anthony will be freed hasn't been made public.
As it happens, Blackwell has a daughter named Caylee too, but that's the end of the similarities.
"Nobody has a right to take the law in their own hands," he said.
"Myself and other members of the team are concerned for her safety, very much so," one of her attorneys, Dorothy Sims, told HLN.
Hostin said on CNN that she's heard reports that Anthony will go into hiding, live under an assumed name or get plastic surgery.
Anthony may be offered money for book and movie deals, but one offer won't be on the table.
"I wouldn't reward someone like that for what has happened," Hefner said.
