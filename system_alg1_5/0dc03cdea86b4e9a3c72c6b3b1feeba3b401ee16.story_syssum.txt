There were cheers as Pope Benedict XVI personally beatified his predecessor, and a huge tapestry protrait of John Paul II was unveiled, showing him as the healthy, vigorous and relatively young man he was early in his papacy.
"Don't be afraid," he exhorted them.
Many in the throng waved Polish flags and holding images of John Paul II, who was archbishop of Krakow in Poland before being elected pope.
For those who couldn't make it to Rome or Krakow, the Vatican created a special Twitter feed for the event, @Pope2YouVatican.
But John Paul II's former spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, told CNN he had no doubt he had been in the presence of a saint.
The nun, Sister Marie Simon-Pierre, was one of two nuns who brought the silver reliquary with the blood to Benedict after John Paul II was beatified.
Sister Tobiana, who worked in the late pope's household, was the other.
