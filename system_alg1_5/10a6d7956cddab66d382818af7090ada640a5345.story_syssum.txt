Set in "Some place calling itself Rome," but filmed, very tellingly, in battle-scarred Serbia and Montenegro, "Coriolanus" imagines a modern state rocked by food shortages and border disputes.
While he easily carries the Senate, tradition demands that Caius, now known as "Coriolanus," must also seek the assent of the citizenry in the public market.
In power, he'd be a disaster.
We know he can play villains, but even if he's essentially a fascist, there is something noble about Coriolanus, and tragic, too, in his inability to bend or compromise.
This is Shakespearean acting of the highest caliber, and a powerful, bloody vision of "honor" gone mad.
