(CNN) -- On some forgotten day in 2004, Cerro Negro, a soot-colored volcano in Nicaragua, was host to an unusual visitor.
Undeterred, Webb's next experiment on Cerro Negro involved a mattress, and, later, his front door.
The sun is high, and the sky unmarred by clouds.
Cerro Negro is a baby in geological terms, the youngest volcano, in fact, in all of Central America -- some boast in an area with such a fund of them.
"To our knowledge, volcano boarding is only possible on Cerro Negro," says Timothy Brauning of the Bigfoot tour company, which leads volcano boarding trips.
"In parts of South America, and other parts of the world, there is something called 'sand boarding,' but this is nothing like volcano boarding.
The Frenchman descended the slope on a bicycle in 2002, achieving a world record of 172 kph on gravel, before wiping out and breaking, according to Jessie, "pretty much everything you can break."
The girl and board crawl off with a sound of wood crunching rock, then momentum builds and she's soon just a soft orange mote chased by a smoky scar, like a jet trail.
Then, at what will prove my terminal velocity, the board slips sideways.
In fact, I'm fine.
An Australian guy, who claims second place, looks crushed.
The ones who admire not just the aesthetics of the wilds, but the possibilities too.
Tours run most days, year round, weather permitting.
