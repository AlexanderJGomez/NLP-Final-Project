The idea of a sole filled with holes came to the company's founder, Mario Moretti Polegato, when he was on a business trip to Reno, Nevada, to promote his family's wine products.
Scientific and technological innovation has been key to Geox's success, and the company has patented numerous new materials in rubber, leather and fabric.
In every factory where we produce there is an Italian technician, a shoemaker, that controls shoe by shoe," said Polegato.
"Our program now is to open 300 Geox stores in China," he added.
