Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's parliament set out new guidelines for its relations with the United States, as it agreed to re-engage with Washington after months of tension over deadly airstrikes on a Pakistani border post by NATO forces and other issues.
"We seek a relationship with Pakistan that is enduring, strategic, and more clearly defined.
Following the deadly border airstrikes, the Pakistani government shut down the two NATO supply routes in the country, asked the United States to vacate an air base on its territory and boycotted a conference about the future of Afghanistan.
He also said it was important to maintain stability in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Pakistan disputed the findings, saying Clark's report was factually incorrect.
