The first African-American president is confronting the delicate issues of justice and discrimination after renewed violence this week in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked by a grand jury's decision not to indict a white police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, a black youth, this summer.
"If any part of the American community doesn't feel welcomed or treated fairly, that's something that puts all of us at risk," Obama said.
"He doesn't want to be the black president.
"When Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son," Obama said.
"I've witnessed that in my own life, and to deny that progress I think is to deny America's capacity for change," he said.
He responded with a speech in Philadelphia in which Obama said Wright's views denigrated the "greatness and goodness of our nation" and rightly offended "white and black alike."
For five years after Obama's seminal speech on race in Philadelphia, he tried to avoid racial issues but stumbled over the controversial case of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. who was arrested in his own home in 2009.
"I could see myself in these young men," Obama said, admitting that he was lucky he made his youthful transgressions in forgiving, multi-cultural Hawaii and not in America's deprived inner cities.
Rogers Smith, co-author of  "Still a House Divided," a study of racial politics in the Obama era, said the president understood the symbolism.
"Your President will be right there with you."
