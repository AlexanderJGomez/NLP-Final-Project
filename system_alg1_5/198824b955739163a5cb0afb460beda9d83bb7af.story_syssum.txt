NASA researchers, publishing in the journal Planetary and Space Science, have demonstrated that this "club sandwich" phenomenon may be happening on Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system and a satellite of Jupiter.
"Its ocean is huge, with enormous pressures, so it was thought that dense ice had to form at the bottom of the ocean.
Vance and colleagues did not visit Ganymede, obviously, but they performed laboratory experiments here on Earth to simulate what would happen to ice and salty water on the Jupiter moon.
There are many forms of ice, which makes modeling conditions on icy moons complex.
In deep oceans, the dense ice would actually be heavier than water, plummeting to the ocean floor.
Senior author Christophe Sotin, also of NASA's JPL, said in a statement that the "sandwich" model reflects a stable state, but there are various reasons why the moon might not achieve this structure; it may even alternate between a "club sandwich" phase and a structure with fewer layers: light ice, ocean, high-pressure ice.
The mission, being developed by the European Space Agency, will visit Europa, Callisto and Ganymede.
