"I was just trying to help her up after they exposed her body," she said.
A Health Ministry spokesman said 16 people died, including 14 by gunshots, according to Dr. Hisham Sheeha.
The woman has not been identified.
The beatings and the use of live ammunition against protesters, particularly women, have outraged Egyptians.
Others came to Suleiman's aid, such as businessman Ehab Hanna, who was also beaten up and shot after he tried to help the woman with the veil.
But when he moved, he was beaten.
I did not imagine they would fire live ammo at their people."
"I started to run, but she froze and fell to the ground when another protester bumped into her," Mahmoud said.
"I will not remain quiet," Mahmoud vowed.
"Our troops do not just attack people for no reason," he said.
"I'm glad her father didn't see this day," Ahmed said.
