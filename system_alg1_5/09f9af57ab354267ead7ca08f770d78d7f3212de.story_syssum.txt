This time, he couldn't overcome a weakness he has shown before, a tendency to distance himself from the audience, and this kept him from connecting and making a good showing.
Let's begin with Romney.
Check.
Poor, steamrolled Jim Lehrer.
But not Wednesday night.
Romney put Obama on the defensive and kept him there all night defending his policies.
This time, Obama clearly presented his theme.
That Romney has no specific plan.
And it failed to put Romney on the defensive.
In fact, it was worse.
For Obama, with a troubled economy, it works against the president.
Although he is correct that some of Romney's numbers simply don't add up, Obama must do a better job of wrestling the details out of him.
If he doesn't, Romney will be like Teflon, and nothing Obama says will stick to him in these debates.
And for goodness sake, Obama, show more energy and passion.
It wasn't a fluke, and he can prove it.
And it worked.
But don't overdo it.
