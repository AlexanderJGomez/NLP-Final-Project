By the time it was over, the 41-year-old Wei was slumped unconscious.
In China's mainstream media and in the blogosphere, angry Chinese are demanding action.
"City inspectors are worse than the mafia," wrote one Chinese blogger.
In the central city of Zhengzhou last year, 1,000 college students scuffled with police and overturned cars after city inspectors roughed up a female student who had set up a street stall.
Wei Wenhua's death stands as clear proof of the violent ways of local city inspectors.
Some journalists and bloggers have even compared Wei's fatal beating to the Rodney King case, when the Los Angeles police repeatedly clubbed him.
The public outcry, amplified in the country's blogosphere, prompted China's premier to restrict police powers of detention.
Millions have opened blogs, too.
Days after Wei's January 7 death, a government official in Tianmen city, Wei's hometown, was fired, four others detained and more than 100 placed under investigation.
Meanwhile, bloggers are heaping eulogies for Wei.
"In the face of violence and brute power, he lifted a citizen's rights, conscience, responsibility and courage."
