The report, which was ordered in the wake of the killing of Michael Brown last year, highlighted a predatory policing problem and a department that was biased, prejudiced and that has regularly targeted, arrested and fined African-Americans.
Indeed, a wholesale review of policies and approaches to law enforcement is needed, something that will likely necessitate drastic reforms in some departments so they can better represent, integrate, problem solve and liaise with the communities they are serving.
America is changing fast, but police departments aren't keeping up.
Mine-resistant ambush protected vehicles, tanks, drones, grenades and assault weapons should not replace the community policing of our Main Streets.
It's that simple.
In fact, the opposite happens.
If we don't press our police departments to reflect the makeup and needs of our communities, then towns like Ferguson will unravel further.
