"That was one of the campaign critiques of Obama that seemed to work well, that seemed to resonate well," Owen said.
"It's not anti-reform -- it's anti-bad reform," Cannon said.

Coming out of one of her town hall meetings Monday, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, said that "people are just getting information that's flat wrong."
Cannon predicted that Obama's plan will fail, but advocates "are going to try more incremental reforms to improve the health care sector."
and that means the Obama administration as well," she said.
