(CNN) -- He travels in private jets and is one of the world's highest-paid athletes, but Fernando Alonso's humble beginnings are never far away from his thoughts.
"My father was the one to introduce the adrenaline and the passion for racing into the family," Alonso says.
"First it was to study," he says.
"I felt that this was a good moment and I would keep this trophy all my life because you never think that you will continue," says Alonso, a cycling enthusiast, too, who hopes to have his own team.
"You enjoy that Sunday.
In Alonso's case, plenty did come.
"We didn't have any preseason test because the car wasn't ready," he recalls.
"You arrive in Formula One, you win the world championship -- that's it.
"It's true that you should beat your teammate to have a better reputation or to have a better result in that weekend," he says.
"But believe me, when we are in a meeting or a debrief after a race, there are zero problems -- there are only good things, helpful comments from the other driver.
"Myself I know I need to deliver my best."
I'm extremely proud and extremely happy with my career," Alonso says.
