While most parents are familiar with the flu, many have never heard of RSV.
RSV, which generally circulates from late fall into the early spring, is out there with a myriad of other stuff floating around right now: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), adenovirus and parainfluenza, all common respiratory viruses, and pertussis, the bacterial disease that causes whooping cough.
"Just in general, when we look at cough and respiratory symptoms, there's a lot of overlap," said Dr. Susan Gerber, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
"I brought him in because he was wheezing and coughing," she says.
Milder coldlike symptoms can be alleviated with proper humidity, over-the-counter pain relievers, nasal drops and extra fluids.
"It was a little scary.
But "we are hopeful," Gerber says.
"There are multiple candidates for a vaccine in development."
