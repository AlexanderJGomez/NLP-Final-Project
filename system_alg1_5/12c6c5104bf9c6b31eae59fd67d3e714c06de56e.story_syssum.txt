Earlier, police said that Davis and her husband were traveling in a truck on a Mexican highway near the city of San Fernando, Mexico, when they were confronted by gunmen in a black pickup.
Villescas said that authorities don't know which criminal group, if any, is responsible for Davis' murder.
After Davis was hit, her husband drove their truck "at high rate of speed" to the Pharr International Bridge, which crosses the Rio Grande.
"They breathed Mexico," Wheeler said.
"They had a petite lady who had the tenacity of a bulldog and was there for you."
