As his one-time "Orphans" co-star, Shia LaBeouf, did last winter, Baldwin has given a public statement that he's ready to retire from public life.
During that standoff, Baldwin was accused of calling a photographer a "c**ksucking f*g." That incident, combined with his Daily Mail dust-up, caused a significant shift in Baldwin's life.
As someone who once relished being out in his home base of New York, where people were generally "very kind" to him, Baldwin says he's now "bitter, defensive, and ... misanthropic" with a distaste for the media that he's never had before.
I definitely should not have reacted the way I did in some of these situations," the actor says.
Yeah, I probably do, because it's only caused me problems.
"I want to go make a movie and be very present for that and give it everything I have, and after we're done, then the rest of the time is mine," he continues.
