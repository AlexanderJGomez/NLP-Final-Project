Robbie Prepas, a nurse and midwife who struggles with car sickness, tried to stay focused.
But then, she saw two feet beginning to emerge -- a breech baby.
Prepas, now 58, has traveled the world with organizations like Save the Children and UNICEF.
"And, believe me, I've seen the worst of everything."
Electricity was out, and there was no running water.
Prepas was stationed in the green tent, and, at one point, was caring for 50 prenatal patients.
"His name was David," she says.
"She was 8 centimeters dilated, and she was ready to deliver."
"Guys, you've got to drive me to Baton Rouge," Prepas barked.
The second child, who came out feet first, was discolored.
"Women are going to have babies out of place," especially during disaster, she says.
"Life goes on after an emergency," she says.
