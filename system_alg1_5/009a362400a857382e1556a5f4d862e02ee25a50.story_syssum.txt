"This was an abduction, not just a missing person," Chief Daniel Shaw told the station.
Heeringa's purse was left in the store, and her car was still there, WOOD reported.
The van could have been a Chrysler Town and Country, he told the station.
"We are desperately looking for additional information," he told WOOD on Monday morning.
Heeringa is described as 5 feet, 1 inches tall, 110 pounds with blond hair, blue eyes and wearing wire-rimmed glasses.
It's been too long," Heeringa's grandfather, Roman Homrich, told Mlive.com on Monday.
"She's very helpful, that's why I think he lured her out of the gas station," the mother told the station.
