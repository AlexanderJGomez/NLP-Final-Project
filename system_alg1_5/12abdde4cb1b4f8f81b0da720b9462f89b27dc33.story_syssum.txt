Suzan Hubbard, director of the Division of Adult Institutions, decided that Susan Atkins' request should not be sent to the sentencing court for consideration, said Terry Thornton, spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.
Atkins, 60, was convicted in the 1969 slayings of actress Sharon Tate and four others.
The court, based in Los Angeles, can either grant or deny Atkins' request.
She also has had a leg amputated, the Los Angeles Times has reported.
According to historical accounts of the murders, Atkins stabbed Tate, who was 8Â½ months pregnant, and wrote the word "pig" in blood on the door of the home the actress shared with her husband, director Roman Polanski.
Atkins, like family leader Charles Manson, received a death sentence.
Nothing was found, police said.
