The Affordable Health Care for America Act, or H.R.
On Sunday, Obama praised the "historic" House vote to pass the bill and called on the Senate to "take the baton" and complete its work.
"For years, we've been told that this couldn't be done," Obama said, citing the decades of failed health care reform efforts.
"If the public option is in there, as a matter of conscience, I will not allow the bill to come to a final vote," Lieberman said.
The lone House Republican who supported the bill, Rep. Anh "Joseph" Cao, told CNN on Sunday he put the needs of his district over the desire of his party.
Also Sunday, Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana, the chamber's third-ranking Republican, said on the Fox program that Democrats were ignoring the wishes of the American public by pushing through the huge health care bill.
"If Democrats keep ignoring the American people, their party's going to be history."
"Well, it was about what I thought it would be," said House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio as he quickly exited.
"I came here to renew the American Dream, so my kids and their kids have the same opportunities I had," Boehner said.
Earlier in the day, Obama met behind closed doors with Democrats to shore up support for the bill, calling it a chance of a generation.
