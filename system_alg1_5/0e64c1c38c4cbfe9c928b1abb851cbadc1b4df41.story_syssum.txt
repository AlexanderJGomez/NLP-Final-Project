Before the World Championships began, the IAAF confirmed Semenya was being tested for gender verification.
This year, the London Olympic Committee instituted a new testing policy that measures testosterone levels of female athletes, rather than DNA.
Semenya had no womb or ovaries, according to the report, and had undescended testes, causing her to have triple the levels of testosterone of other female athletes.
"There's no simple test to determine gender, so what we're left with is an imperfect system," says Dr. Eric Vilain, a UCLA medical geneticist who served as a medical adviser to the IOC on its new policy for testing female athletes for "hyperandrogenism" -- meaning producing too many male hormones.
Vilain disagrees, saying that "there's a huge no man's land"  between male and female testosterone levels.
He also suggests "there could be no testing, which has been argued," by Jordan-Young and Karkazis, "but the vast majority of female athletes I have spoken with believe there should be some sort of testing" when questions are raised about female athletes.
He says that for the small number of female athletes who learn they have high levels of testosterone, treating the condition, whether it is caused by a disorder of sex development or an adrenal malfunction, will benefit their health.
