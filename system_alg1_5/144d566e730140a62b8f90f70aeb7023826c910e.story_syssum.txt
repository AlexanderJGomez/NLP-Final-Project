Earlier, Czech Republic had kept their qualification hopes alive with a deserved 2-1 win over Greece, who can still qualify for the knockout stages if they beat Russia in their final game.
The Czechs, needing a response following their 4-1 defeat to Russia, got off to a remarkably fast start.
Either way, as it had been in their first game against Poland, Greece's first-half luck was completely out.
It ensured Poland took away the point they deserved, but it could have been more.
Instead, it was Russia who took control eight minutes before half-time.
When the ball finally found its way to Blaszczykowski, he took one right-foot touch to set himself up for a shot before unleashing an unstoppable left-foot shot that flew past Russian keeper Vyacheslav Malafeev.
