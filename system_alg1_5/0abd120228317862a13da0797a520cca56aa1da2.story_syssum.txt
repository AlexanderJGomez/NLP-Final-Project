A jury acquitted Kerrigan on an involuntary manslaughter charge.
Mark Kerrigan was taken into custody immediately, said Cara O'Brien, spokeswoman for the Middlesex County District Attorney's Office.
"My family has never believed at all that my brother had anything to do with my father's death," Nancy Kerrigan said outside the courthouse.
Kerrigan's family has said Daniel Kerrigan had a heart condition.
