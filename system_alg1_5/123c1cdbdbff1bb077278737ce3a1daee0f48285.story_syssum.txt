So, days before the president's second inaugural, the nation, too, is set to regroup.
"The enormous promise that everyone felt four years ago, it isn't completely gone but we have diminished our horizons," said Robert Schmuhl, an American studies professor at the University of Notre Dame.
"I think Obama has learned some things," said Curtis Gans, director of American University's Center for the Study of the American Electorate.
"We are not a deadbeat nation," Obama said during a nearly hour-long briefing from the East Room of the White House.
"In a way, it's a period when the administration will be dealing with problems that are in process."
"There was clearly a shift in the mood," Zelizer said.
"In both cases, the presidents were good at claiming credit for it."
"Going into the second term, the fiscal situation will continue the agenda and the discussion," he said.
Some 41% of those polled disapproved of the deal, according to Pew, and 52% thought the deal would hurt people like them.
Just weeks after Obama takes his oath of office, a new Congress will be tasked with addressing the automatic spending cuts, or sequester, that were kicked down the road in order to pass a smaller deal at the end of the year.
Immigration reform, another White House priority, will also stoke ideological differences and test the demographic shifts in Congress.
And despite several high-ranking exceptions, Obama's Cabinet -- so far -- is shaping up to be largely male and white.
And that's where the nation's shift over the next four years may be most visible.
