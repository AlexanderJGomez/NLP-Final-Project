Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) -- The search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 resumed Sunday, but stormy weather may cause problems, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said.
Eight ships will join the search by the end of the day, including the Australian Ocean Shield, which will be fitted with a "black box" detector and an autonomous underwater vehicle, AMSA said.
"After entering the search area, the airlifter flew for about 20 minutes," crew member Wang Zhenwu told the television network.
The captain, Liu Jun, said buoys containing dye were dropped on each of the suspected sites, according to CCTV.
"Even hoping against hope, no matter how remote, of course, we are praying and we will continue our search for the possible survivors," said Hishammuddin Hussein, Malaysia's acting transportation minister.
yelled Wen Wancheng, 63, whose only son was among the passengers.
They implored Hishammuddin to redouble the efforts, and he said Malaysian authorities would do so.
"For me, as the minister responsible, this is the hardest part of my life, at the moment," he told reporters.
After the latest data analysis, experts says they believe that Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared three weeks ago, ended up in the southern Indian Ocean.
CNN's Kyung Lah, who went out on a U.S. Navy P-8 search plane Friday, said its crew spotted white objects, orange rope and a blue bag.
"At one point, sure, everybody on board got a little excited, but it's impossible to tell from that distance what anything is," she said.
When those efforts proved fruitless, the search spread north into the Andaman Sea and northern Indian Ocean.
On Saturday, after confronting relatives' grief, they made that conclusion seem less final.
