ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Nearly two dozen Americans -- most thought to work for the CIA -- were sentenced to five years in prison Wednesday by an Italian court for their role in the seizing of a suspected terrorist in Italy in 2003, the prosecutor in the case told CNN.
He was seized on the streets of Milan, Italy, in 2003, transferred to Egypt and tortured, he said.
There are no shortcuts," Spataro told CNN.
Sabrina De Sousa, one of the American defendants, was "saddened, angered and dismayed" by the ruling, her lawyer told CNN.
"We understand why the Italians did what they did.
"We are clearly disappointed by the court's ruling," Morrell said.
The American Civil Liberties Union, a persistent critic of Washington's extraordinary rendition program, demanded the United States match Italy's actions.
The Italians included the former head of Italian intelligence, Nicolo Pollari, and one of his deputies.
Berlusconi has since returned to power.
