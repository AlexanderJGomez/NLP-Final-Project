Everybody does.
Now, we have Chapter 2.
New York City officials say Hillman has had an apartment but, for some reason, returns to the streets.
As for Hillman, Kelly flippantly explained, "We're not looking for him.
He, too, was rescued by a miracle.
Some problems, such as homelessness, require complex solutions.
Sadly for the Jeff Hillmans of America, the weakest of the weak, America seems to have decided it has less money to help its neediest.
Despite the economic slump, three-quarters of the giving, $217 billion, came from individuals.
Still, thousands sleep out in the cold.
Homeless life is stressful and dangerous.
According to those figures, New York has one homeless person for every 2,506 people, compared with one for every 259 in San Francisco.
Whatever the figure, more can be done.
There is also more poverty, inequality, unemployment.
The story is not over.
But the more effective act of generosity, the real miracle, would come if the millions looking at the picture of the generous police officer trying to help a man in need wrote the perfect Chapter 3, pushing for better mental health services, more affordable housing, more job training.
