Dublin, Ireland (CNN) -- The situation in Syria is accelerating, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Thursday, amid reports that President Bashar al-Assad's government may be preparing to use chemical weapons.
"The intelligence that we have raises serious concerns that this is being considered," he said.
"Syria would never use chemical weapons, even if it had them, against its own people," he told Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV.
On Thursday, a top Russian politician said the Syrian government "is not up to the task" of doing its job and cannot "fulfill its functions," the Interfax news agency reported.
That plan, negotiated in June in Geneva, proposed the creation of a transitional government along with al-Assad leaving office.
As a result, Washington has been pushing the opposition to unite.
Early next week, Clinton will travel to Marrakesh, Morocco, for a meeting of the Friends of the Syrian People, a gathering of countries that support the political transition.
"Our concerns are that an increasingly desperate Assad regime might turn to chemical weapons or might lose control of them to one of the many groups that are now operating within Syria," she said.
In addition to Germany, the United States and Netherlands, both of which have Patriot capabilities, have signaled they would be willing to contribute missiles.
We know they have chemical weapons and, of course, they also have to be included in our calculations," he said.
"If true, these reports may mean that the United States and our allies are facing the prospect of an imminent use of weapons of mass destruction in Syria, and this may be the last warning we get," McCain said.
