(CNN) -- Thanks to a wave of new mobile technology, I can store my calendar, car keys, credit cards, music and notes all on my smartphone.
I tested the Powerbag messenger bag for about a month, and I also spent a brief time using the backpack, which is very similar.
"Our batteries are all rigorously and thoroughly tested, enduring the most abusive of treatment, still upholding Powerbag's high standard of safety."
I already charge my smartphone, tablet, laptop, iPod, computer mouse and Bluetooth headset.
The bag includes three standard-size cords, including one that works with iPhones and iPods, and another that charges BlackBerrys, Mi-Fis and many Android phones.
The cap and charging port located on the side of the bag snapped off a few days after I started testing it, and so from then on, I had to take the battery out and plug the cord in directly whenever I needed to refuel.
The RFA spokesman said this was only an issue with pre-production models, like the one I tested, and that it's been fixed for the bags sold in stores.
The Powerbag, designed by Ful, is stylish as well as useful, making it a good companion for gadgetheads who don't want to advertise their geekiness.
