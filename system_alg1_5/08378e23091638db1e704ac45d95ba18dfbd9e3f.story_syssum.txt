Facebook and Google have added new translation tools, but they take different approaches.
And of course, we don't all speak the same language.
But for now, here's a look at the latest language features from both companies, and some background on how their translation services work.
How it works: Real people are at the heart of Facebook translation plan.
Size: More than 65 languages function on Facebook now, according to Facebook's statistics.
Also, Facebook's site is available in many languages, but its human translators don't touch wall posts, photo comments and other user-submitted items, which is a big con if you want to have friends who don't share a common language with you.
Craig Ulliott, founder of whereivebeen.com, said he's excited about Facebook's translation application, but it would be too much to ask his site's users to translate user-submitted material.
The site's interface has been translated, with the help of Google users, into 130 languages.
Google also recently unveiled a translation service for Google Docs, which lets anyone upload a document to the Web and have it translated into a number of languages for free.
Och said real-time translation of Internet chats is on the horizon, as are more languages and increased quality as Google's computers get smarter.
Also, Google lets people spot translation errors, suggest new wordings and translate its interface into languages Google's computers don't speak just yet.
