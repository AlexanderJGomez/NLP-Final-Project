While Phoenix still kicked inside me, I told him that if he needed to let go, if he wasn't strong enough for this life, I could handle it.
We discussed the diagnosis we had been given and what that would mean for his, and our, future.
What we wanted more than anything was for him to live the time that he had left knowing our touch, knowing our love, feeling that we were with him, no matter what.

When the nurse handed him to me for the first time, I fully realized how little, how light he really was.
They belong to us, Phoenix and Adam and me.
There was no sign from him, ever, in either life or death.
And only with this distance can I see that, perhaps, he did the best he could for me, too.
In the end, Meloney Dunning, 39, of Indianapolis, was named the winner, claiming a prize of $3,000.
