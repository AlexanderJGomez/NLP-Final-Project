Before that, my late wife Thea and I, she in her wheelchair, would watch the parade together every year.
I lived with and loved my late spouse, Thea Spyer, for more than four decades in love and joy, and in sickness and health, until death did us part.
At a time when the gay organizations that I approached responded with, "It's the wrong time for the movement," Robbie Kaplan said -- as did the Rev.
She answered my plea, and took me on.
To all the gay people and their supporters who have cheered me on, thank you.
If I had to survive Thea, what a glorious way to do it.
