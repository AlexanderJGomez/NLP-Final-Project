HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- In the decade since the 1997 handover of Hong Kong to China, local movie-makers have faced daunting changes in the industry.
By 1997, that number dropped to 85 films grossing $69 million, according to the Hong Kong, Kowloon and New Territories Motion Picture Industry Association (MPIA).
"1997, unfortunately, coincides with the beginning of the collapse of the local film industry -- a well-documented fact," says screenwriter Jimmy Ngai.
"Today production is down, with many majors like Chinastar and Golden Harvest scaling back," he says.
"No talents, no formal training, in most areas such as script-writing, directing, acting, etc," he says.
Tim Youngs, Hong Kong consultant for Italy's Far East Film Festival, says changing tastes among Hong Kong movie-goers has also affected the industry.
"The drive to attain world adoration," Kerr says.
"Around 1997, like lots of Hong Kong people, I kind of lost myself," says independent film-maker Chan Wing-chiu.
"That's me," says Chan, referring to the girls.
Hong Kong already has a bad reputation for Putonghua, but I don't feel ashamed.
Because our language, our culture, our values, our way of thinking are different.
After 1997, we lost the confidence to be Hong Kong people."
