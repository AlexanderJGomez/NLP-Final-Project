Radar data from air traffic control can provide tracking data that will indicate the flight path, altitude and direction the A320-200 followed.
No matter how obvious it might appear, airplane incidents and accidents generally involve more than one factor.
Unfortunately, route restrictions, other aircraft traffic and altitude constraints sometimes prevent our flights from deviating as far as we'd like.
Although airliners are structurally designed to withstand turbulence, intentional flight into a thunderstorm is never an option.
Oftentimes, a request for a higher altitude is to provide a smoother ride.
Because of the confusing information, pilots would have difficulty reacting.
Regardless of any speculation, it is much too early for theories.
