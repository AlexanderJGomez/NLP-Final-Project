Pistorius admits shooting Steenkamp through a closed door, killing her, but has told the court in Pretoria, South Africa, that he mistook her for an intruder.
He has pleaded not guilty.
The disorder meant Pistorius had "excessive" concerns about security and felt threatened even when, objectively, he was not, Dr. Merryll Vorster testified on May 12.
In his cross-examination, Nel focused on the effect of light on Pistorius' balance.
"If it was indeed pitch dark, that is so," Versfeld replied.
"The moment there is light available, he will be able to use his vision to balance," Versfeld said, agreeing that if Pistorius had known the objects in his room, that would also have helped protect him from falling.
If Masipa accepts that Pistorius did not know Steenkamp was the person he was shooting at, she could find him guilty of culpable homicide, a lesser charge than murder, or acquit him, according to CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps.
A verdict of culpable homicide would leave the sentence at Masipa's discretion.
