Since that first season, Davies has risen to become Ari's chief rival on the show.
It's just on the page," Belfi said.
Belfi: Adam Davies has become ... one of the few characters on the show that really knows how to get under Ari's skin and push his buttons.
It's entertaining.
And back then, Adam Davies was still in his cubicle.
And I think that's what people really respond to.
Belfi: What gives Ari a little bit of his soul, his heart, is that we have all these scenes with his wife and his family, and you really get to see him as a dad.
And the thing is, I think that's what made the rivalry between him and Ari so great.
Impossible question!
And that's really funny.
It was both funny and heartbreaking.
But in terms of the really exciting stuff between Adam Davies and Ari, I guess I'll say this: At the end of season two, when Ari is trying to form his coup, to break up the agency, and Adam is the one who rats him out and gets him fired and humiliated and causes that whole thing ...
So some fun, exciting stuff to look forward to.
