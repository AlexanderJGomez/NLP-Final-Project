Hawking, on the other hand, has lived more than 40 years since he learned he had the disease, which is also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease in America and motor neuron disease, or MND, in the United Kingdom.
Bob Hawkins, 75, of Fayetteville, North Carolina, who learned of his ALS diagnosis last year, said Hawking, with his long life and ability to communicate through a voice synthesizer, gives him hope.
This empowerment theme is part of the mission of the ALS Association, she said.
He has participated in some of the organization's high-profile events, said Mel Barry, communications manager at the MND Association.
"It totally upsets your entire way of living," Hawkins of North Carolina said.
Still, patients experience different symptoms, and some do have cognitive impairment, Matland said.
The nature of the disease is that it's very different in each person, she said.
Drugs in these trials include lithium, ceftriaxone, and memantine, according to the ALS Association.
In the UK, the MND Association is funding a trial for lithium, which has produced promising results in mice, Barry said.
"I would encourage everyone to recognize how terrible this disease is, and encourage them to support the ALS Association and research projects," he said.
