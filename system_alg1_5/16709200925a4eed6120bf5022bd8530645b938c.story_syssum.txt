Woods shot a six-over-par 76 Saturday on Merion's unforgiving East Course and McIlroy, second only to Woods in the world rankings, carded a 75.
Woods, though, wouldn't hit another birdie for the rest of the round.
McIlroy, in search of a third major, wasn't much better, hitting one more birdie than Woods.
Day, the 2011 runner-up, ended the third round in eighth place after a two-under-par 68.
"I've had opportunities in years past, and it has been so fun, even though it's been heart-breaking to come so close a number of times and let it slide," said the four-time major winner, who turns 43 on Sunday.
Former world No.
Kim, born in South Korea but raised in San Diego, had been in a tie for third after firing four birdies in six holes but a horrendous finish -- bogey, double bogey, bogey -- meant he ended with a 71, five shots behind Mickelson.
