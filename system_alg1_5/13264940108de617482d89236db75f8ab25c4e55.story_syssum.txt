China has remained mostly closed to Hollywood, with a quota of 20 foreign films per year, most of them being from the United States.
The Chinese film, "Flying Swords of Dragon Gate," rounded the top four with $3.7 million.
According to the ruling, China's measures relating to the importation and distribution of films, sound recordings, audiovisual home entertainment products and reading materials breached its trading rights commitments as a WTO member.
"The Flowers of War," directed by Chinese director Zhang Yimou and starring Oscar-winner Christian Bale, cost $100 million to make, the largest production made in China.
"In addition to content creation, the joint venture will pursue business opportunities in the areas of live entertainment, theme parks, mobile, online, interactive games and consumer products," DreamWorks Animation said in its announcement.
The sequel, which made $95 million at the Chinese box office last year, was second only to "Transformers 3," which brought in $170 million.
