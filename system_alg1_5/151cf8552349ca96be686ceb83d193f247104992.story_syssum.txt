The boy's father, Okee Wade, 37, who has a lengthy arrest record, pleaded guilty in New Jersey Thursday to a charge of second-degree racketeering in connection with an elaborate bank fraud scheme.
A judge ordered him released on his own recognizance until February 6 to attend his son's funeral, according to the state attorney general's office.
It's his child.
Kryzie King, 27, was indicted in connection with the boy's death in Manhattan criminal court Wednesday.
In a statement last week, King's attorney, Bryan Konoski, said: "My client is not charged with homicide at this time and she is presumed to be innocent of allegations against her.
The child appeared malnourished, the complaint said.
"Each one of these tragedies, it's our job to try to stop," he said.
