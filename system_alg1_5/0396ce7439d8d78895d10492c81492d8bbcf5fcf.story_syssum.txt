On Thursday, 195 survivors were transferred to a humanitarian aid camp close to the Tunisia-Libya border, according to a statement from the refugee agency.
The passengers were mostly migrants from West Africa, Pakistan and Bangladesh who were fleeing fighting in Libya, the refugee agency said in a statement.
"Desperate passengers rushed to one side, seeking rescue by the Tunisian coast guard and fishing boats that had approached the vessel," and the boat capsized, the agency said.
"Boats loaded with migrants fleeing the ongoing conflict in Libya have been making the journey to Italy and Malta over recent months, sometimes with tragic consequences," the refugee agency said in its statement.
