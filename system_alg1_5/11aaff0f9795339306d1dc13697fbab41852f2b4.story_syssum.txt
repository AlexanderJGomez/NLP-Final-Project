It is 10 years after the invasion of Iraq, and images of Iraqi women from various political parties are filling the streets of Baghdad ahead of April's local elections -- a sign to casual observers that women's equality is on track in this war-ravaged country.
But on the other hand, women are no longer guaranteed equal treatment under one law in terms of marriage, divorce, inheritance and custody.
And while both women and men suffered as a result, the impact on women was greater due to their limited mobility in the face of poor security.
Today, female college students ask me if it is true that the streets of Baghdad were once full of women driving, that women could walk around in public at all times of the day without worry, that university campuses were once filled with women who did not wearing headscarves.
But despite the challenges that face them, some Iraqi women continue to stand up for women's rights.
They deserve everyone's support, for the story of women's rights is the story of Iraq's future.
