They were here to see "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview," a documentary of sorts that's now playing in a handful of U.S. cities.
"It was the first time in 16 years he touched the tape," Cringely told the audience at Thursday's screening.
After the movie completes its brief run in theaters, "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview" will probably be made available online and on DVD, Cringely said.
"He never sat for another interview like this, and what a shame," Cringely said.
"No," Jobs said, it meant exactly what it implied, and he explained that the "A players" don't require him to "baby their egos."
"The only problem with Microsoft is, they just have no taste," he said in a now-famous line.
"People like symbols," Jobs said.
