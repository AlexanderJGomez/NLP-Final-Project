(CNN) -- Up to 30 million people are facing "a humanitarian disaster" as one of Africa's biggest lakes shrinks, a United Nations agency warned Thursday.
"It would be a human disaster, a tragedy," he said.
The organization will unveil the results of a study into the diversion of the Oubangui river in an effort to help Lake Chad at a conference, "Saving Lake Chad," in Rome, Italy, on Friday.
The lake borders on Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria, one of Africa's most populous countries.
Similar warnings have been issued about lakes in Mexico, Russia and elsewhere.
