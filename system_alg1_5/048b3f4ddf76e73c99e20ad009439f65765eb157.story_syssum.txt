The demonstrations began Tuesday, when an International Crimes Tribunal sentenced Abdul Quader Mollah, assistant secretary general for the  Jamaat-e-Islami party, to life in prison.
Home Ministry officials said security forces were patrolling in Dhaka and other major cities, including in the large southeastern port city of Chittagong, where at least four people were killed Tuesday during clashes between police and supporters of Jamaat-e-Islami.
Mollah, 64, was found guilty of five of six charges, including murder.
After the verdict was read, Mollah stood from the chair on which he had been seated and cried, "Allahu Akbar!"
On January 21, the same tribunal sentenced to death the first war crimes convict, Abul Kalam Azad, alias Bachchu Razakar.
