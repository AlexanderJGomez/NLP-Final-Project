NEW YORK (CNN) -- The Justice Department and federal prosecutors will investigate allegations of discrimination against Latinos by police in Suffolk County, New York, officials said.
"We became involved because we thought that the charges filed originally by the police department did not meet with the facts of the case," said Cesar Perales, president and general counsel of New York-based LatinoJustice PRLDEF: specifically, that the youths were not charged with murder.
"The Lucero murder, while the worst of the violence so far, was hardly an isolated incident," the report said.
"I have to be honest with you," he said.
"When these defendants were indicted for their specific roles in the murder of Marcelo Lucero, most of the defendants admitted they had committed other attacks targeting Hispanic victims, a practice they described as 'beaner hopping,' " Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota said in a statement at the time.
"We have very good relationship with our minority community," Dormer said.
"We're very proud of the way the police department interacts with our minority communities."
