His heroic showing overshadowed Kimi Raikkonen's first victory since 2009, and ended the Finn's slim hopes of a second world title ahead of the final two races.
We had to fight through the laps, then we had a good strategy that gave us a chance for the victory, but second was the maximum," Alonso said.
"The second safety car helped, then I had a nice fight with Jenson (Button).
There was a chance we could screw it up, but we didn't do that."
"It's been a hard season, not an easy time, but hopefully this gives us more belief," said Raikkonen, who will stay at Lotus for the second year of his contract.
