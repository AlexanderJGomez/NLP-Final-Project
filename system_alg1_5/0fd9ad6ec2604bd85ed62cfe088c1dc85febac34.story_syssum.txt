That is the case with some of our nation's best public universities today.
Our nation's public universities are the heart and soul of our higher education system, which is the envy of the world.
If our public universities fall into a decline because of a leadership vacuum, then our entire system will decline, too.
They also ask for increased public access to flagship universities through traditional and online forms of education.
It's the same for advanced research.
Innovation and creativity require freedom, security and flexibility.
The system works for some, but not for everyone.
Although alumni want their universities to be the best in the world, their support (as generous as it may be) cannot replace government money.
What we need is an open and participatory process where university boards, state leaders, faculty, students and campus presidents formulate measurable goals for reasonable reforms, cost-savings, and more efficiency.
University presidents should be empowered to pursue these goals, in a reasonable time frame, with transparent accountability.
That is what they meant by the "public" in university.
Public universities need protection and they also need serious, thoughtful reform.
