It happens, but when it happens to Justin Bieber, it's beyond a big deal.
Bieber has had both.
His musical mentor Usher Raymond, a former teen star himself, told MTV in December 2013 that his young protege was experiencing the pains of growing up in the spotlight.

"Speaking from personal experience, this could save his life."
Since then, Spears has managed to turn her life around, bagged a gig as a judge on "The X Factor" for a season, as well as a new boyfriend, album and Las Vegas residency.

In the past, he has been less than repentant, telling The Hollywood Reporter in November about those who criticize his behavior, "I don't give a f***."
