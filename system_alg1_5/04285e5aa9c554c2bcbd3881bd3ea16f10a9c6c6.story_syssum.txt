Wayne Nelson Corliss, 58, was arrested at his apartment in Union City, New Jersey, about midnight Wednesday by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, Interpol said in a written statement.
Interpol announced Tuesday that it was attempting to identify the man, who was featured in 100 photographs sexually abusing at least three boys between the ages of 6 and 10, it said.
"Two days ago, this man's nationality, identity and location were totally unknown," Interpol Secretary General Ronald K. Noble said.
Corliss is charged with producing child pornography, according to prosecutors.
Also shown is a "Chang" water bottle, common in Thailand, the court documents said.
On Wednesday, Interpol said it was sifting through hundreds of tips that had poured in.
Ten days later, Christopher Paul Neil, a 32-year-old Canadian who had been working as an English-language teacher in South Korea, was arrested in Thailand and charged with child abuse after police managed to reverse the photo-masking process.
