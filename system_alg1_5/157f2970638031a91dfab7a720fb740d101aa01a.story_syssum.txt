Along with provincial elections in Iraq, residents in Basra may also be voting to become an autonomous region.
"The federalists in Basra appear to be more prepared to work with Baghdad than the Kurds have been so far," Visser said.
A monthlong petition drive started Monday for a Basra region referendum -- which would be held if at least 10 percent of the more than 1.4 million registered voters in the province sign up, said the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq, or UNAMI, which is helping Iraq with its electoral process.
"What rights the regions will have with regard to the oil sector remains controversial," said Visser, also the editor of historiae.org -- where he posts scholarly papers about Iraq, including one on Monday about the Basra region.
Cities in the province include Basra city, Umm Qasr and Zubayr.
