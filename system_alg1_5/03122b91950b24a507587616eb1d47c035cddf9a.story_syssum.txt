U.S. officials later took the two negotiating pirates into custody -- a move that goes against standard negotiation practices, the maritime source said.
On Friday, the FBI said there was no comment due to the continuing investigation.
According to the the U.S. official,  who was not authorized to discuss the Quest hijacking on the record, the issue was not whether the two pirates were serious about negotiating, but that they lacked the power to cut a deal.
The FBI hostage negotiator is part of a special team based at Quantico, Virginia, and had field experience, the U.S. official said.
When Fox spoke last week, he said two pirates boarded a U.S. Navy ship Monday for talks.
Two pirates were found dead on board the Quest, said Fox.
Globally, more than 50 pirate attacks have already taken place in 2011.
