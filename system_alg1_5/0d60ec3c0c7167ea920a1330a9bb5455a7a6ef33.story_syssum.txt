And then, just a few hours after Khloe posted (and deleted) the inflammatory photo, Kim decided to unleash her naked, oiled butt onto the world.
If you're curious, husband Kanye West approves.
It isn't clear where the image originated, but Khloe shared that along with her own comment, calling the statement "True."
"We're all equally f****d up," says the photo in the post, which was shared Tuesday.
Over on his own Instagram account, Kourtney Kardashian's partner, Scott Disick, chimed in with his spin on the statement.
