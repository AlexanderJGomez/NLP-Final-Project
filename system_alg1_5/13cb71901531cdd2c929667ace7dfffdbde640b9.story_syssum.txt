ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan understands the need to move "urgently and transparently" against extremists on its soil after last week's terrorist attacks in India, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said after meetings with Pakistani leaders.
"There does need to be action," she said.
Rice's visit to Islamabad came a day after Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, met with Zardari and top military and intelligence officials in Islamabad.
Its foreign minister, Pranab Mukherjee, warned that India will consider all options "to protect its territorial integrity" if Pakistan refuses.
According to a statement issued by Mullen's Pentagon office, the admiral thanked Indian officials "for their restraint and their desire to cooperate with Pakistani officials" and repeated an offer by U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to help in the investigation of the Mumbai attacks which killed 179 people.
