New York (CNN) -- If the Americans followed the French presidential elections as avidly as the French stare at the poll ratings of Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, they would know that "Sarko l'Américain," Sarkozy the American, may soon have to say "good bye" to the Elysée Palace.
But it is not always enough.
No.
And if the first rule of therapy is to verbalize, France has been vocal, to say the least.
Sure, America saved us.
It is one of the reasons why, in contrast to most other western countries, the French conservative parties and its establishment never saw the American entrepreneurial way of business as a suitable model.
That did not happen.
"The most American of the two is not who you would think," a diplomat whispered to me after one of their first meetings, strangely mixing admiration, irony and plain old stereotypes.
But both sides agreed to buy a magazine cover story that asked: "The Americans, What do they think of us?"
