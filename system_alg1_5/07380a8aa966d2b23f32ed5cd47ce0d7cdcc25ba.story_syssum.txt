As of Friday night, prosecutors had yet to make a decision on the case, according to a manager of the ship's customs brokers.
The captain and crew members were all expected to give statements to investigators, the manager said.
Every bit of news is speculative at this point," The crew member said in the Saturday night e-mail.
There is an active U.S. embassy in the country, however, and U.S. consular officials did visit the ship's crew members on Thursday night, according to the crew member.
Officials in Venezuela, meanwhile, did not respond Friday to requests for comment.
The crew member, in another e-mail to CNN on Friday, said that though his colleagues were upset, no one had been mistreated.
A few hours after the ship arrived, it was boarded by officials from Interpol, Venezuelan police officers and narcotics investigators who said they had received a tip that the vessel was smuggling drugs, the crew member said.
Then the Venezuelan authorities had the crew unload all the ship's cargo so they could search it, and again didn't find any contraband, the crew member said.
The captain hasn't been back to the ship since, the crew member said, but he has talked on the phone to the chief mate.
The captain was detained after he refused to let authorities arrest the crew, she said.
The crew member said life aboard the ship is tolerable, within limits.
"The mood is OK," he said.
