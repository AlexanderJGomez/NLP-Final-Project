Cabri Chamberlin, then a freshman, said she was raped by another student last May at the Xi Chapter of Psi Upsilon fraternity house in Middletown, Connecticut, at a pledge "strip show," says the suit, which was filed Tuesday in a Connecticut federal court.
"Psi Upsilon Fraternity takes all reports of risk management violations, especially those with regard to sexual assault, very seriously," Tom Fox, executive director of Psi Upsilon Fraternity, said on the fraternity's website.
The investigation is ongoing, and no charges have been filed, she said.
Chamberlin's lawyer, Douglas Fierberg, said that because the fraternity sets itself apart from the university, officers from the university's Department of Public Safety can enter the fraternity only in "exigent circumstances" or when specifically asked to come in.
"All have seen increased scrutiny over the past few years," Roth said of fraternities.
"On behalf of the university community, I want to express our horror at this shameful assault," Roth said in the statement.
The fraternity had garnered the on-campus reputation as the "Rape Factory," according to the lawsuit.
The case was settled in court-ordered mediation in August 2013.
