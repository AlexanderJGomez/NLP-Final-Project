In Baquba, the militants were shooting randomly from the roof of the Diyala provincial council building at Iraqi security forces who surrounded the structure, said the officials, who did not want to be named because they are not authorized to release information to media.
By Tuesday afternoon, however, security forces regained control of the building and the hostages were freed.
"It's a tragic incident," said Hasan al-Saneid, who chairs a security committee in parliament, speaking with Iraqiya state television.
In March, armed militants took over a government building in Tikrit in northern Iraq and held hostages.
A new Iraqi government was formed in December but key positions that oversee security forces remain vacant amid political wrangling.
