Marc Marquez held off Valentino Rossi to claim the opening MotoGP race of the season in Qatar on Sunday, picking up where he left off last year.
"I enjoyed a lot that race, especially after the injury," Marquez told BT Sport.
The 21-year-old, who lost his pole advantage seconds after the start, saved his fastest lap time for the end.
"But starting from 10th, second is a great result.
"Luckily I feel good," he told BT Sport.
I made a junior mistake."
