"We have brought Celina home, not the way we wanted to bring her home," New Hampshire Senior Assistant Attorney General Jane Young said.
"Based on what we have seen visually, we are treating it as suspicious," she said.
Young described it as a "routine search because of the proximity to (Celina's) home," about one-quarter mile away.
"I ... can't believe what's gone on," Laro said on Monday.
Since then, local, state and federal investigators had searched for her and for clues about her whereabouts "by air, by land, by water," Young said Sunday evening.
"(It was) a household that supposedly gave her great love, that's what she always told me," Laro said Monday.
