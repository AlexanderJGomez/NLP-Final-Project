(CNN) -- Sri Lanka's cricket team returned home to Colombo early Wednesday, as police in Pakistan searched for at least 12 gunmen believed responsible for the attack that left seven people dead.
ET Monday), as the visiting Sri Lankan team's bus approached Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium for a match against Pakistan.
"The events can only be described as shocking, and we send our sympathy to the relatives of those who lost their lives," International Cricket Council President David Morgan said at a news conference in London Tuesday.
ICC Chief Executive Haroon Lorgat said none of the teams had been threatened before Tuesday's attack, which happened about 150 meters from the stadium in Lahore.
Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari praised Pakistani police, saying the officers "rose to the occasion and laid down their lives to protect our Sri Lankan guests."
With this attack, fans now worry that Pakistan won't be able to co-host the 2011 Cricket World Cup with India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.
"It's a very important event, but the safety and security of players, officials and supporters is very important and the board will be taking that into account."
John Stern, the editor of cricket magazine Wisden, said it was "not possible" to imagine international cricket taking place in Pakistan in the near future.
He said one possibility for the Pakistani team is to play its matches in the United Kingdom, which has a large Pakistani community.
