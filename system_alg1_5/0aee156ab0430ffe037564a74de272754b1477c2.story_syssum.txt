The process began at 7:34 p.m. and ended 17 minutes later at 7:51 p.m., said Paul Czachowski, public affairs manager for the Georgia Department of Corrections.
Lynd, 53, had requested as his last meal two pepper jack BBQ burgers with crisp onions, two baked potatoes with sour cream, bacon and cheese and a large strawberry milkshake -- all from a local restaurant.
In Mississippi, authorities had planned to execute Earl Wesley Berry on Monday, but the state Supreme Court set the date for May 21.
In the Georgia case, Lynd was convicted of fatally shooting his girlfriend, Virginia "Ginger" Moore, in Berrien County in 1988.
As the sentence was being carried out, about 20 opponents of the death penalty prayed and sang songs outside the prison, located 45 minutes south of Atlanta, said Laura Moye, chairwoman of Georgians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty.
The charges have been dropped.
Georgia prosecutors, however, maintain that the death penalty is carried out fairly in their state.
If she is executed, she would be the first woman put to death in three years.
Kentucky and other states use 3 grams, a standard that the Supreme Court judged to be constitutional.
