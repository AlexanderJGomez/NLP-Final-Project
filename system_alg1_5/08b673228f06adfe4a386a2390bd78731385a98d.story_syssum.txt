The trial of the 66-year-old man, better known as Duch, resumed Monday just outside the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh.
Here, men, women and children were shackled to iron beds and tortured -- before they were beaten to death, prosecutors said.
Three years, eight months and 20 days later, at least 1.7 million people -- nearly one-quarter of Cambodia's population -- were dead from execution, disease, starvation and overwork, according to the Documentation Center of Cambodia.
If convicted, Duch faces from five years to life in prison.
"I think there is a feeling of, well you know, finally -- now it's finally happening after all these years of waiting -- hearing, fighting, negotiating," he told CNN last month.
The regime's leader, Pol Pot, died in 1998.
"It's hard to control my feelings when I see this," he said, as he watched footage of the prison taken 30 years ago.
