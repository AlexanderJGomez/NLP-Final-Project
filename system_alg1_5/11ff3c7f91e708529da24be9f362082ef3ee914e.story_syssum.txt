(CNN) -- The president of the Central African Republic has fled the country's capital and rebels have seized control of the city, a government official said Sunday.
Word of Bozize's surprise departure came as violence erupted in the capital, Bangui.
Sounds of fierce gunfire rang out for hours Sunday, she said.
The rebel group, based in the country's north, managed to take control of several towns and move toward Bangui in the following weeks.
Meanwhile, on Sunday, U.N. officials in the Central African Republic were preparing to evacuate.
"As a human being, I am afraid," Ikavi said.
