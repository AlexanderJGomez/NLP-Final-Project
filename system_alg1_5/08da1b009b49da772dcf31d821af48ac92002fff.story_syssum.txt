That's why last summer, when we were offered a chance to join the international relief and development organization Oxfam on a trip to Haiti as part of its GROW campaign, we jumped at the opportunity.
You don't often hear stories of hope from Haiti.
But during our short visit, we saw a different Haiti.
We cooked jambalaya with produce bought from those gritty urban farmers, most of whom had lost spouses, siblings or parents in the earthquake.
The innovation, ingenuity and hope we saw can create the foundations of a Haiti known for its food, culture and beauty rather than its poverty.
Together, Haitian people can lift themselves up and build a better future for their country.
