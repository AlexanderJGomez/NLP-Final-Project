Veteran journalist and author Sandra Mackey died Sunday, her son, Colin Mackey, said.
Over the years, a stream of books followed.
"Scholars may be put off by Mackey's occasionally florid, bombastic language, but her work is a sound analysis and a sympathetic yet balanced effort to explain Arab perspectives to Americans," Elizabeth R. Hayford wrote in Library Journal.
"If war prevails, we shall beget a greater disorder in the Persian Gulf," Mackey wrote in the book.
Mackey had an Oklahoma twang, the slightly nasal kind that she was proud of, but that belied her worldly understanding.
"In a perfect world, Shia, Sunni, and Kurd, followed by a company of other minorities, would walk into the post-Hussein Iraq as a liberated people united by common suffering," Mackey wrote.
"With American troops on the ground and no governing authority capable of taking charge, the United States faces the real possibility of a secular version of militant Islam," Mackey said.
"I am literally a little old lady in tennis shoes," she used to joke about her ability to gain the confidence of countless sources.
