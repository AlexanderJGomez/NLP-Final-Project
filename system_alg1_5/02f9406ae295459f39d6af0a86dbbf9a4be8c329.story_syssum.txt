"Foreign embassies and consulates in China don't have the legal authority to monitor China's environment or release relevant data, nor do they have the professional capabilities or conditions to do so," said Liu Weimin, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, at a daily press briefing.
"We are not interested," he said.
For example, at 11 a.m. Wednesday, the U.S. Embassy reading for Beijing reported a PM 2.5 concentration of 191 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) for an Air Quality Index value of 241, a "very unhealthy" score.
But under pressure to improve its notoriously poor air quality, China began releasing PM 2.5 data for Beijing in January.
These rent moves build upon revised air quality policies that require an index of PM 2.5 be implemented nationwide by January 1, 2016.
