Security forces arrived at the scene, fought the attackers and regained control of the building, police said.
Before the latest violence, Irina Bokova, director-general of the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, denounced the killings of eight journalists in Iraq this year.
The Committee to Protect Journalists, a watchdog group, said in a report this month that journalists have been subjected to threats and killings.
Violence occurred in other regions of Iraq on Monday, police said.
Three people died in shootings in Mosul, and an attack on a bus in Baquba, northeast of Baghdad, left three others dead, police said.
