Executives of AVA Solar, based in Fort Collins, Colorado, are among green energy industry representatives invited to the bill signing.
Once production is up to speed, CEO Pascal Noronha says, the plant should create enough solar panels a year to power 40,000 U.S. homes.
Without the stimulus, Noronha said, AVA Solar is on track to create 420 new jobs by the end of this year.

"As a company we would very much like to have customers here in the U.S.," Noronha says.
"Well, to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, there is only renewable energy.
