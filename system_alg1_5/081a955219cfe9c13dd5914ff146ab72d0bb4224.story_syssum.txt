Gustavo Valsangiacomo, president of the Argentina Beef Industry Union, declined to say the boycott was responsible for the price drop.
Within a few days of the tomato boycott, prices dropped, the consumer organization said.
"There has to be an equilibrium between their costs and what consumers are paying," the industry chief said.
Argentineans eat more beef than any other nation in the world -- 68 kilograms (150 lbs) per person annually, the Farm Federation said.
