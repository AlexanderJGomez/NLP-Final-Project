KEY WEST, Florida (CNN)  -- The USNS General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, a retired U.S. Navy warship, embarked on a sedentary new career Wednesday on the floor of the Gulf of Mexico.
"Everything looked very, very smooth."
Newman, who was circling in a helicopter above the 522-foot-long ship, said the Vandenberg appeared to rest in a level position on the Gulf floor.
To sink the Vandenberg, holes were made above the waterline in the side of the ship and throughout various decks, Newman said.
The Vandenberg was built at the Kaiser shipyard in Richmond, California, in 1943.
The Vandenberg was chosen from among 400 decommissioned military vessels mainly based on appearance: "her topside structure, her smooth, interesting hull lines, big girth and her starring role in a motion picture," Newman said.
The former warship slipped under the water about 24 miles south of Pensacola, Florida, the Navy says on its Web site.
The Oriskany was 888 feet long, and weighed 32,000 tons.
