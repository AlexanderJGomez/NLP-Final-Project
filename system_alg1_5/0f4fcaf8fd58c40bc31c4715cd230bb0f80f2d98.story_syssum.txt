Michael Mazza, 40, was arrested outside a pawn shop in Hollywood, Florida, hours after the death of Broward County Deputy Paul Rein sparked a massive manhunt.
That's all it took," Lamberti said.
The deputy's body showed other injuries from the fight -- a broken finger, bruises and cuts, Lamberti said.
When the man arrived at the second pawn shop, he left Mazza in the car and went inside, Lamberti said.
As he was talking to the clerk, a television in the shop began broadcasting news about the deputy's shooting, and showed a picture of Mazza, he said.
Mazza initially was reluctant to talk to authorities, but later agreed, and confessed to shooting Rein, the sheriff said.
When caught, however, Mazza was wearing a T-shirt, shorts and sneakers, Lamberti told reporters.
Thin staffing and scant resources prevent more than one deputy being involved, he said.
"It's a routine thing," Lamberti said.
