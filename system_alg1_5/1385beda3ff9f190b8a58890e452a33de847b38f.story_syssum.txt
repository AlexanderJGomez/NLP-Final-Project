Today Dylan really doesn't write protest songs and hardly, it would seem, does anyone else.
"If the protest song is defined by the lone voice with a guitar, then it probably has declined, even though people like Billy Bragg and so forth strive to keep it alive."
Suddenly, in a world where the counter culture was brushing the brim of mainstream culture, even rock n' roll, which hitherto had limited itself to the subjects of love, sex, cars and dancing, was overflowing with political messages; Jimi Hendrix played a version of the "Star-Spangled Banner" which was interpreted by many as an anti-Vietnam statement.
Meanwhile in the UK, the punk movement took on the mantle of political protest from its folk and rock forebears, with groups such as The Clash criticizing racial disharmony in British society.
In 2006 Pink released the single "Dear Mr President," an open letter to George W. Bush criticizing some of his policies, on her album "I'm Not Dead".
But it seems musicians are still flexing their muscles in the political sphere, only the protest comes dressed in different clothes, with a new hard-nosed approach that matches the nous of politicians.
In fact, Geldof has pointedly lambasted the protest song, claiming it has little or no power to effect change.
