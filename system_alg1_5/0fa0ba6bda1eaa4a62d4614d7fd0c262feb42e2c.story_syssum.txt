The election that occurred Sunday should be a second.
Aznar's replacement, Jose Luis Zapatero, ended the Spanish commitment to Iraq and sundered the close relationship with the United States.
Indeed for a long time, Zapatero seemed not to comprehend that Spain faced any economic challenges at all.
For centuries, Spain had lagged behind the rest of Europe economically.
Spain had signed up for the euro currency back in the 1990s.
Instead, the price of German goods and services steadily declined inside Spain.
Between 2002 and 2008, Spanish households went on a borrowing binge.
By 2008, construction accounted for a staggering 16% of the Spanish economy.
The debts remain.
As debtors scramble to service their debts, they cut back their buying of goods and services.
But it will take more than an election to do the job.
