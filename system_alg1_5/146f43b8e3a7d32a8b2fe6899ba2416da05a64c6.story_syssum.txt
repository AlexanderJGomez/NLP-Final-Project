Scalia, along with Bryan Garner, is co-author of a new book, "Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts."
Scalia would not specifically address the health care decision or other recent or current case issues, such as immigration enforcement, affirmative action or gay marriage.
"We are not a political institution," Scalia said.
"If you don't like the death penalty, fine, change the law," he said.
"Get over it," he said about supporters of Al Gore, many of whom are still convinced the case was wrongly decided in favor of the Republican.
President Ronald Reagan named Scalia to the high court in 1986 after previous jobs as an appeals court judge, a government and private lawyer, and a law professor.
"At one extreme, he can alienate some of his colleagues," said Joan Biskupic, legal affairs editor at Reuters, who has written a biography of Scalia.
In fact, he prides himself on not being PC on the bench, in court."
Antonin Gregory Scalia was born in 1936 and admitted to being the center of attention as the only child, doted on by his father, a Sicilian-born professor of romance languages, and his mother, a schoolteacher.
"The court pays more attention now to the text" of the law and the Constitution, he said, and less to legislative history, congressional floor debates and the views of foreign governments.
"Of course, I'll retire when I start to realize I'm not doing as good a job as I should," he said, adding he still thinks he is fully engaged.
