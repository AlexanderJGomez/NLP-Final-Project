(CNN) -- At first, Miguel Hernandez thought it was a mistake, or worse, a joke.
"It's abhorrent that President Obama is releasing criminals into our communities to promote his political agenda on sequestration," House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, said.
The decision was made by career ICE employees, an administration official told CNN.
"Detainees with serious criminal histories are a detention priority and have not been released," she said.
Most were given a paper with a court date, but not Hernandez.
He wants to know exactly how many detainees were released, and where, and the reason for each person's detention.
"I don't know why this affects them -- I'm not a criminal," he said.
