(CNN) -- Jean Lindsay, a spunky 67-year-old with two masters' degrees, panicked after she failed to land a job in the garden center of a Lowe's home-improvement store.
"God, I felt like I was falling off the ends of the earth," she said.
For Lindsay, like many people these days, the Internet has become both a tool for economic recovery and a cure for isolation.
"It's a great way of being able to network with people who are either in a similar situation or who may have some resources to help you," she said.
Almost immediately, she was hooked.
"I was in my nightgown at noon, and I wasn't getting at the job search very fast, and I thought, 'this is instructive,' " she said, laughing.
The same goes for her job search.
"This has really invigorated me," she said of her forays with a virtual persona.
Dan Beach, Lindsay's second cousin, who lives in Florida, said Skype, social media sites and online video have been "a salvation" for Lindsay.
At first, Lindsay's online presence surprised him.
She's a charming person."
"I love hardware stores, so Lowe's would have been perfect.
We're probably fooling ourselves that we can go on and do anything," she said, "but we can't live that way."
