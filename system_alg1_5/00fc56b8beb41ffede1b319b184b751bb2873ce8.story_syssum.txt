(CNN) -- A Dutch court intervened Friday to stop a 13-year-old girl from attempting to sail around the world by herself, stripping her parents of sole custody.
The move prevents the parents from permitting Laura to set off on her trip alone, though Laura will remain at home with her father, Dick Dekker, a court official said.
The teenager was out sailing Friday, de Lange said.
Laura believes she will be able to convince the court that she is fit to make the trip alone, de Lange said.
It's "whether she's got the physical strength, the mental strength, or the technical ability," he said.
Another sailor, Robin Knox-Johnston, also said age shouldn't be the only determining factor.
he said.
That's a big difference," she told CNN.
