But they are hard-core hackers who claim to have gained access to the world's most sensitive sites, including the Pentagon.
There are Web sites with high-level security, but there is always a weakness," says Xiao Chen, the leader of this group.
You must know what program it is written with," says Xiao Chen.
"There is a saying, 'Know about both yourself and the enemy, and you will be invincible.'"
On camera, Xiao Chen denies knowing anyone who has targetted U.S. government Web sites.
This week, the Pentagon said computer networks in the United States, Germany, Britain and France were hit last year by what they call "multiple intrusions," many of them originating from China.
"We are here today because we must do more," said Robert Jamison, a top official in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
But again off-camera, Xiao Chen says after the alleged Pentagon attack, his colleagues were paid by the Chinese government.
"I am telling you honestly, the Chinese government does not do such a thing," Qin said.
And across China, there could be thousands just like him, all trying to prove themselves against some of the most secure Web sites in the world.
