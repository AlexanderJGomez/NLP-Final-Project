Dr. West, an academic philosopher at Princeton University, has for decades spoken up for the poor.
That said, I respectfully disagree with West and Smiley's characterization of President Obama's first term in office.
They ignore the positive moves Obama has made to benefit -- in real ways -- the black community, the poor, the disadvantaged, and the country as a whole.
Let's take Obama and health care reform.
Then there is the Children's Health Insurance Re-authorization Act, signed into law by Obama, which provides health care to millions of kids .
President Obama also expanded Pell Grants, which help low income students pay for college.
There's more.
Such statistics are, as Rep. Maxine Waters has said, "unconscionable."
If West and Smiley would like Obama to do more, that's valid.
I'm not saying that President Obama should be exempt from criticism, nor do I believe it is some act of racial treason for a black person to hold our president accountable for his actions.
We must not forget the mess that President Obama walked into.
Our climb will be steep.
