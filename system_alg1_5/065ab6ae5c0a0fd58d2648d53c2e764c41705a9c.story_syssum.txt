McLaughlin had struggled with weight his entire life.
"I was living a bachelor lifestyle," says McLaughlin.
It was tough to stop going out to eat for lunch and dinner, McLaughlin says.
Between the two of them, McLaughlin says they would split three bottles of wine with dinner.
"I love the dining experience and social aspect," says McLaughlin.
"Now I tend to drink wine only, and I enjoy and savor the taste instead of just drinking for the sake and experience," McLaughlin says.
"It's hard to go to the gym after work," he says.
In the last three years, McLaughlin has lost 140 pounds.
"A lot of my life still revolves around food and drink, but it's no longer destructive," says McLaughlin.
