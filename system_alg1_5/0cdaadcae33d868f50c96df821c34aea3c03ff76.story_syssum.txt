Loughner, 22, is accused of shooting U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, and 18 other people on January 8, six of them fatally.
Loughner, who is being held by authorities in Arizona, did not appear in court Friday.
The mug shot of a smirking Loughner that has widely appeared in the media was one taken by Pima County, Arizona, authorities after the shootings.
Federal prosecutors also opposed publicly disclosing the inventory of their search of Loughner's house after the shooting, arguing in court papers that the media doesn't have a right to search warrant materials until a formal indictment against Loughner is made.
Loughner had also faced two murder charges in the deaths of Roll and Zimmerman, but in a procedural maneuver last week, prosecutors temporarily dropped those two charges and plan to bring them back under a superseding indictment that is expected to include other charges as well.
Friday's hearing was held in San Diego because presiding Judge Burns and Loughner's federal public defender, Judy Clarke, are based in the city.
Two federal judicial sources told CNN last month they expect Loughner's attorneys to ask that any trial be moved out of Arizona, possibly to San Diego, but the Justice Department indicated it would oppose a move.
There are federal courthouses in Phoenix, Flagstaff and Yuma.
