Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad asked to visit ground zero, but New York city officials said no.
But, he said, "If there were a further request, we'd reject it" because of security fears.
"It is appalling that President Ahmadinejad, one of the world's leading sponsors of terror, would find it appropriate to visit this hallowed ground," State Department spokesman Tom Casey said.
Hillary Clinton, the New York senator and Democratic front-runner, called the request "unacceptable."
