Williams was extended by Kvitova in a near hour-long first set, which saw both exchange breaks before going into a tiebreak.
But Williams eventually took the game to go up a double break and served out for the match.
The 25-year-old Zvonareva reached her first grand slam final after seeing off Pirinkova, who beat Venus Williams in the quarterfinals.
The turning point of their match came in the sixth game of the second set as Zvonareva made the breakthrough on Pirinkova's service and went on to level at a set all.
