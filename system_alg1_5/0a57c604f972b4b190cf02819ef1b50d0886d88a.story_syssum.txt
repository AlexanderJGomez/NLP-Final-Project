(CNN)More than 22 months ago, the body of Odin Lloyd was found in an industrial park in North Attleboro, Massachusetts.
Long before Hernandez made national headlines, he was a standout athlete in Bristol, Connecticut, who came from a family described as a local sports dynasty.
The young Hernandez was the "golden boy," playing football, basketball and running track, following in the footsteps of his uncle, older brother and father -- all well-known athletes in the community.
In just his first semester, a police report says, Hernandez got into a fight at an off-campus restaurant, sucker-punching the manager and rupturing his eardrum.
The case remains open, and no one has been charged.
Less than a year after signing the deal, however, the Patriots dropped him on the day he was charged with Lloyd's murder.
"He said he was at the club with Mr. Hernandez, and that they were partying and he had a good time, and that Mr. Hernandez spent a good amount of money," Branch recalled.
Jenkins is the younger sister of Shayanna, who's engaged to Hernandez and is the mother of his little girl.
On June 16, 2013, Lloyd was riding with friends in the black Suburban, which police later learned was rented by Hernandez.
Three people got out of the car, and Lloyd was not one of them.
They, too, pleaded not guilty.
The jury wouldn't see the text Lloyd sent to his sister, telling her he was with "Nfl."
Hernandez began trailing Abreu, Furtado and three of their friends in his SUV, authorities said.
Hernandez allegedly said, "Yo, what's up now," followed by a racial slur, and fired at least five rounds from a .38-caliber revolver, Haggan said.
