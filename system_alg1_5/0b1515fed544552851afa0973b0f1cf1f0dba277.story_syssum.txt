After being introduced by Liverpool chairman Tom Werner, the 39-year-old Rodgers, who moves to Anfield from Swansea City, revealed that he had insisted that he would not work under a director of football.
"I promise I'll fight for my life and for the people in this city," said Rodgers.
Rodgers spent a season in charge at Watford, in the second tier of English football, before moving to Reading in 2009, but he only lasted six months before he was sacked.
They beat Premier League champions Manchester City, Arsenal and, ironically, Liverpool on the final day of the season.
The 21-year-old made 37 Premier League appearances for Liverpool last season, after joining the club from Sunderland in June 2011.
