Joplin, Missouri, where 124 died in a tornado Sunday, was briefly under a tornado warning late Tuesday, but it was later lifted.
Four people died in the county, said Cherokee Ballard, spokesperson for the state medical examiner.
"Our town is totally leveled," she said.
It later reached Newcastle, before pushing through Moore and Norman, suburbs of Oklahoma City.
"We have been extremely lucky," he said.
Two or three businesses were damaged, as was an elementary school.
It was on the ground, but it wasn't bad."

The University of Oklahoma, based in Norman, on Tuesday afternoon suspended classes at its three campuses.
But when it hit, they were unimpressed.
Tornado watches were in effect Tuesday evening in Texas, Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Kansas.
