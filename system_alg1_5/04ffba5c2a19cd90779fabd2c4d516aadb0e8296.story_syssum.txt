Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules on health care reform, the justices have one thing in common, and one thing in common with a growing cohort of Americans: They are aging.
A vital home care work force has developed to meet these needs, and its interests are inextricably bound to the future of health care.
These women work tirelessly to feed and bathe our nation's senior citizens, serve as a go-between with family and doctors, count medication, even take care of pets, and yet they are denied basic wages, let alone benefits, worker protections and pathways to citizenship.
We need to create more jobs in America, address the need for home care, and improve the quality of care jobs all at the same time.
The Affordable Care Act was a great leap forward in improving a health care system that isn't working well for senior citizens, workers or any of us.
But if the justices would just think of themselves as senior citizens and soon-to-be-seniors, they would uphold the Affordable Care Act for the sake of older Americans, care workers and our shared future.
