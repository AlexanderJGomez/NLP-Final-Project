An autopsy was conducted Monday in the Bahamas on the body of the couple's son, Jett Travolta.
He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival, local police said.
The body was cremated, Wilchcombe said Monday.
"We are heartbroken that our time with him was so brief," they said.
We're all one family here, you know.
