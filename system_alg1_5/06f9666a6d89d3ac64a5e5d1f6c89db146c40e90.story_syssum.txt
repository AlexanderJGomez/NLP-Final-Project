But remarkably, it did not end his career, rather it was a dislocated left kneecap after crashing in another training run at Lake Louise, Canada in November 2012 that finally called time on his professional career on the slopes.
"The first time I was on skis, I thought 'okay, shit, this is a nice feeling, I wanna go back in the World Cup'," he recalls.
Then I told me, okay, it's the first race, just ski easily.
But if you are a skier, if you are a pro, if you're the downhill, it's not so dangerous because you know what you can do, you know how it works and, for us, Kitzb√ºhel, when you ski it's easy."
You came back, you were in the World Cup again, you did it, you have you're whole life in front of you'."
Part of him, the racer within, would like to be in that start gate to tackle the slope on which he was lucky to survive.
