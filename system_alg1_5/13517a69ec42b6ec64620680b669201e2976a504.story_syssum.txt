Washington (CNN)Israeli officials are looking at changing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to address a joint meeting of Congress, including potentially relocating the speech, according to an Israeli source.
At this moment there is no change to the plans," this official told CNN.
Ron Dermer, the Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. made the rounds last week on Capitol Hill, meeting with frustrated House Democrats, including some Jewish members, who lashed out at his handling of the matter.
While affirming their support for Israel, these members urged Netanyahu to reconsider coming to the House floor, and suggested moving the speech to another venue --anywhere in Washington outside the chamber, according to one source familiar with these discussions.
As much as I love Angela, if she was two weeks away from an election, she probably would not have received an invitation to the White House, and I suspect she wouldn't have asked for one," Obama said.
On Friday, Vice President Joe Biden's office announced he would not attend the speech because he will be traveling abroad.
"You never know, things happen in people's schedules," Pelosi said.
Both Herzog and Livni, who have teamed up to form an alliance in the election, have criticized Netanyahu's decision to address Congress and have urged him to cancel it.
Another poll published by the Times of Israel on Monday showed Netanyahu's party four seats in the Knesset behind Herzog and Livni's  Zionist Camp alliance.
