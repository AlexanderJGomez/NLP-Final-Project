Hamas, weak and desperate for a victory, isn't ready to stand down.
Sooner or later, Israel and Hamas will once again find themselves back in bitter confrontation.
In a perverse way, Hamas and Israel serve one another's needs.
And that's why it isn't at all surprising that this round, like previous ones, will sooner or later have to end.
Turkey has influence with Hamas, but its ties with Israel are too rocky.
In 2012, you had a Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt, led by Mohamed Morsy, that maintained very close relations with Hamas.
El-Sisi is no Brotherhood lover, to say the least.
He must be sensitive to the civilian casualties in Gaza, which can create political trouble on the Egyptian street, empower Egyptian Islamists, and force him to blast Israel, which he doesn't want to do.
This brings us to the deal itself.
Israel, on the other hand, wants to make sure Hamas doesn't gain too much politically.
This is the Middle East, not Switzerland.
That would make escalation, not a deal, inevitable.
