Tim Masters, left, stands with attorney David Wymore, right, before Masters' release from prison last year.
Masters now has a lawsuit pending against several police officers, ex-prosecutors and the city.
Other than that, life is good.
Masters: Yeah, I think that has a lot to do with it.
Masters: The big challenge is, first of all, you've got to find out where the auctions are.
I go to the auction, and I bid on stuff.
Masters: Not enough.
Masters: Travel.
Sometimes it sells, sometimes it doesn't.
That was cool.
It has my calendar, my address book, everything on it.
Masters: There's so much.
Masters: Yeah, in '92.
Masters: Yeah, I think I am.
Masters: Oh, absolutely.
Masters: I don't want to talk to them at all.
Masters: I don't know what I'd say to them.
I still have family over there though, so I'm over there every once in a while.
I didn't know.
They did it to me before.
