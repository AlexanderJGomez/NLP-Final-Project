(CNN) -- On October 1, 1982, the first commercial compact disc, Billy Joel's "52nd Street," was released in Japan.
The first test CD was Richard Strauss's "Eine Alpensinfonie," and the first CD actually pressed at a factory was ABBA's "The Visitors," but that disc wasn't released commercially until later.
When they arrived, CDs were hailed for their pristine sound.
"For most people who weren't audiophiles, the switch to CDs was a revolution.
"Changing formats usually has greater impact on the way people listen, consume and disseminate the music, but it also does have an impact on the creative side," said Katz.
The discs were small, just 4.5 inches in diameter, and could be carted around far more easily than records.
Three decades later, it may be surprising to some that CD sales, and Billy Joel's career, are still alive.
Like CDs before them, this new format is changing both the creation and consumption of music.
Listeners have more flexibility than ever, with unlimited mix-and-match options.
But a generation of music fans grew up on them -- Nirvana, Public Enemy, Billy Joel and all.
