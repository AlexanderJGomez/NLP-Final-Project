Yes, I'm ethnic Chinese, but I'm Chinese-American.
All this has given me an intimate look at urban Chinese women, their lives and their dreams.
Naturally, these women want to put their education to good use in their careers.
Men were the heads of household, women the caregivers.
In China, sex and power are deeply intertwined.
This applies equally to China now.
That's why many writers and editors who care about women's culture are fighting to redefine beauty in China, show that strong is beautiful, and profile women who've ignored the rules, defined their own lives, and who as a result are lovely and amazing at every age.
