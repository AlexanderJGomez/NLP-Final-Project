"As a mother, I felt like I let my kids down, and that bothered me," Taylor said.
Thanks to A Wider Circle, Taylor now tucks her daughters, Genora, 7, and Anna, 1, into beds of their own each night.
"Once we get their homes furnished they have a chance to just take a breath and start to create a different life," said Bergel, 51.
Today, Bergel's group operates two warehouses stocked with furniture, linens, clothing and toys, where families can pick out the items they need.
"Most people are in poverty because they were born into it," Bergel said.
In addition, the program equips new mothers with cribs, changing tables, strollers and other items to help them raise healthy children.
For Bergel, it's personal.
"I want to help create the change that will enable people to rise out of poverty and enjoy the freedom and independence afforded to others," he said.
