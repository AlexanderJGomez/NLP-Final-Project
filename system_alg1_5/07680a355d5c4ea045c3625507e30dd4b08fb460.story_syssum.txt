Order has now been restored at the facility on Manus, a sparsely populated jungle island, he said.
The unrest on Manus overnight followed "low-level demonstrations" at the center on the island, Morrison said.
"The vast majority of transferees in that facility did not participate in that protest last night, that disturbance," he said.
"The news of a death is a great tragedy," Morrison said, expressing his sympathies to the deceased's family and friends.
