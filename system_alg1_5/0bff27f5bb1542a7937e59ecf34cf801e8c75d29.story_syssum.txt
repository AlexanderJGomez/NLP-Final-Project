Perry also wants President Barack Obama and Congress to hire an additional 3,000 border patrol agents for the Texas border, which would eventually replace the temporary guard forces.
The Rio Grande sector, where most of the immigrant children are turning themselves into the border patrol, has a large number of agents but it is also the largest crossing.
One border sheriff, Omar Lucio of Cameron County, said he is skeptical of Perry's plan.
Conservatives largely point to border security as their top immigration priority and Perry has been an outspoken proponent of securing the border since the influx of immigrants began.
"You cannot have (national security) without border security," Perry said.
And the amount spent on border security has more than doubled.
Protests have erupted along the border with activists demanding immediate deportation.
