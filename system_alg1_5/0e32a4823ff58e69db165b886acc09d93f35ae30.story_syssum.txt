As a junior, sick of the bullies and comments from teachers, Walters went to his father and told him he was dropping out of school.
He recalls his dad saying, "John, quitting is unlike anything else in life.
He was 53.
"My world had collapsed," Walters said.
On July 18, he woke up and decided he had had enough.
He was done.
I quit quitting."
He had no idea how he would do it, but he was determined to lose weight without surgery and knew he needed help.
Walters would walk a quarter mile, then rest for 5 minutes.
A few months later, he started running.
Terri Hartman, a nurse practitioner who worked with Walters early on in his diet, said she's thrilled with his progress.
This time, Walters is determined not to quit.
... Imagining my sons and wife without me, makes every ounce of effort I put in worth it."
