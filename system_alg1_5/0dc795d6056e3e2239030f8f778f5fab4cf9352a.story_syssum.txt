Hack.
I only mention this because I had to be up at four 4 a.m. to get picked up for my day of shark cage-diving, and, clearly, I wasn't getting too much sleep.
But just as quickly as the sharks arrived, they were gone.
As a scientific study, this symphony of motion sickness was about as fascinating as the sharks.
In all, it was sort of a bittersweet experience.
