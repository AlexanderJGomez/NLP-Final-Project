Atlanta (CNN) -- On September 1, 2012, an adult inmate was attacked at Baldwin State Prison in Hardwick, Georgia.
The report details the attack on that inmate, and other attacks on other prisoners, and calls for the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate.
The violence is staggering and, according to the center's report, becoming more and more brutal.
The problem, Geraghty said, is multidimensional.
And on, and on and on.
Last year, some 21,000 men and women were released from Georgia prisons, according to the report.
Twenty-one percent of the 33 homicides of Georgia prisoners since 2010 took place at Smith State Prison, located in Glennville, Georgia, according to the Southern Center for Human Rights.
For context, between 2001-2011, there were 31 state prisoner deaths by homicide reported in Georgia, nine in Alabama, 21 in South Carolina, 44 in Florida, eight in Pennsylvania, seven in Mississippi and 142 in California, the nation's most populous state, according to Justice Department statistics.
