Congress, of course.
We regularly travel to eastern Congo, and on our last trip, we traced the minerals from the mines.
Some minerals trading companies have also argued that Congress and the conflict minerals movement will force them to pull out of Congo, creating an embargo and hurting miners.
Let's first be clear: The statements originate with many of the same companies that have been knowingly purchasing conflict minerals for the past decade, according to the United Nations, and did nothing for years to avoid them.
These steps are complex, but they are achievable.
Electronics, jewelry and minerals companies should partner with donors to set up this program as soon as possible.
Consumers, companies and governments can all play a part in ending this deadly trade and cutting off the fuel for the deadliest war in the world.
