As of this writing, Sheen's Twitter account, @CharlieSheen, has more than 1.3 million followers.
Sheen, of course, has been all over the news since he publicly disparaged Chuck Lorre, producer of Sheen's successful sitcom "Two and a Half Men" in a bizarre interview with Alex Jones of InfoWars last month.
Since then, Sheen has been interviewed by various other high-profile outlets making equally odd statements.
