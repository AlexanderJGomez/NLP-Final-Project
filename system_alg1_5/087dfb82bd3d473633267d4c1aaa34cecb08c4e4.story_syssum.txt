McDonnell had no comment on the meetings.
It's between Republican Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, who has his own ties to the man behind the McDonnell scandal, and Democrat Terry McAuliffe, a heavyweight political fundraiser, businessman and close friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton.
It was clear following his landslide victory for governor," said Jeff Schapiro, columnist for the Richmond Times-Dispatch.
Questions center on gifts: $15,000 for catering costs for McDonnell's daughter's wedding, $15,000 for clothing purchases for his wife, Maureen, and $6,500 for a Rolex watch.
McDonnell has reported other gifts from Williams, including a stay at a lake house and private plane travel.
There are calls for McDonnell to step down, but he said in July that he plans to finish his term.
