They are accused of bringing prostitutes to their Cartagena hotel Wednesday night, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Monday his personnel "let the boss down" with their conduct.
A hotel manager tried to get in the room, and eventually the woman emerged and said "they owed her money," according to King.
"So we let the boss down, because nobody's talking about what went on in Colombia other than this incident," Dempsey said.
"This is an organization with a great history, a history of being disciplined," Issa, R-California, told CNN's "John King USA."
"We're representing the people of the United States, and when we travel to another country, I expect us to observe the highest standards," he said.
"We believe there may be more than five," Little said Monday.
He defined their role as in "support" of the Secret Service.
"This incident is not reflective of the behavior of our personnel as they travel every day throughout the country and the world performing their duties in a dedicated, professional manner," Morrissey said Saturday.
