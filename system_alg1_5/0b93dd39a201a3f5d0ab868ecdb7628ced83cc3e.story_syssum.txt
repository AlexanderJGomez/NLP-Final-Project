Judge John Cleland, who presided over Sandusky's conviction and sentencing, heard arguments Thursday at Centre County court in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, but did not rule immediately.
Cleland could easily rule that evidence presented at the criminal trial was so overwhelming -- the victims' testimony, for instance -- that the defense's concerns would not have changed the end result, said Karl Rominger, one of Sandusky's lawyers.
The acts occurred, they said, in showers in Penn State's athletic facilities; hotel rooms; and the basement of Sandusky's home, among other places.
"If you win on one of the appeal issues, everything probably falls," Amendola has said.
The NCAA slapped Penn State with fines and sanctions over the case, but Pennsylvania's governor announced a lawsuit last week against the collegiate athletic board, saying Sandusky's actions were a criminal matter and not a violation of NCAA rules.
