Heather Cho was working for Korean Air on December 5 when, as a first-class passenger on an international flight, an attendant served her macadamia nuts in a bag.
But the flight attendant testified that she was pressured by another Korean Air manager to keep quiet about Cho's behavior.
The case, dubbed "nut rage," gripped South Korea, especially because Cho is the Korean Air chairman's daughter.
Details of Cho's behavior on the flight have emerged.
When the flight arrived in Korea, the flight attendant said another airline manager, Yeo Woon-jin, pressured her not to talk to investigators about Cho's physically abusing her and Park.
