Jacintha Saldanha was buried Monday after a Mass at Our Lady of Health, Shirva, according to the Rev.
Believing the call was genuine, she transferred it to the King Edward VII's Hospital ward where Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, was being treated for severe morning sickness.
"We are shattered and there's an unfillable void in our lives," her daughter, Lisha, said.
The hospital, which has said Saldanha was not subject to any disciplinary actions because of the prank, set up a memorial fund to benefit her family.
