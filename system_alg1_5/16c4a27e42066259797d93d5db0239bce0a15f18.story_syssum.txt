The International Olympic Committee said it was also officially disqualifying Ara Abrahamian, 35, from his event, Greco-Roman wrestling.
"The awards ceremony is a highly symbolic ritual, acknowledged as such by all athletes and other participants," the IOC said.
Abrahamian never expressed regret or offered an apology, the IOC said.
He then put it down and walked off.
Samadov later apologized, but the IOC upheld its decision to disqualify him, and he was later banned for life by the sport's governing body.
