President Obama says if it wasn't for Stevie Wonder's music, he and the first lady may not have dated.
Wonder's tune, "Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours," was often played at Obama's campaign stops.
I needn't say more," Wonder said, drawing laughter and applause.
Obama staff members said the event was part of an effort to open the White House to a broader community.
