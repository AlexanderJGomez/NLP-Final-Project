(CNN) -- When Lukas Hartmann, 29, signed up for 23andMe's at-home genetic testing service, there were no surprises in his results.
Genetic testing can be a powerful tool.
The action triggered outrage among some of 23andMe's supporters.
Though it's been 10 years since the Human Genome Project was completed, scientists still don't understand what every gene does, and what a mutation might mean for someone's health.
Hundreds of genes may contribute to the development of these diseases, Nagy says, and a person's risk is also influenced by his or her environment.
"That's where it gets a little scary, because if a person has a normal test result on 23andMe, they leave thinking they don't have a risk," she says.
"I seriously doubt that a doctor would agree to perform, say, a double mastectomy, based on these results."
Giving this kind of information to someone unfamiliar with genetic testing's limitations could prove dangerous.
"Our message is to be a smart consumer," Nagy says.
"I can live with that," he wrote.
"For quite some time, I hope."
