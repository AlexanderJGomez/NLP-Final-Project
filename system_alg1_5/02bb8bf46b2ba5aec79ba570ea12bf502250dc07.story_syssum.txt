A terrorist.
Mandela was branded a communist by the white apartheid government, which made it a crime to be one.
South Africa's government came down on the side of the West -- and communist or not, Mandela was squarely on the other side.
With Slovo and other Marxists, he co-founded the militia movement Umkhonto we Sizwe.
After his release from prison, Mandela made some high-profile appearances with communist leaders.
"The ANC is not a communist Party," he said.
At the time that Umkhonto we Sizwe carried out its first attacks, Mandela was at its helm.
He may not have been directly behind the attacks, said Hermann Giliomee, a historian from South Africa.
"He was on the run, so I don't think he had time for the planning on this."
"He was rather strong against racism," Terreblanche said.
"Umkhonto we Sizwe is a new, independent body, formed by Africans, It includes in its ranks South Africans of all races," the group said in its manifesto.
At a sports match in 1995, as President, Mandela made a gesture of support to white South Africans that drew gasps.
They were almost all white.
