Sure, there was the possibility of syndication, but there weren't cable channels that ran "Law & Order" marathons.
And, by the same token, all that technology wasn't splitting the audience for TV and movies into smaller and smaller pieces.
Fox, just ending its first season with a weekend-only lineup that included "21 Jump Street" and "The New Adventures of Beans Baxter," was barely a blip on a TV screen dominated by ABC, NBC and CBS.
"Once another medium, particularly cable, gets a chance to draw viewers away, they don't come back, and that wasn't the case in 1988," TV historian Tim Brooks told the trade publication Multichannel News.
"Traditional media needs the exposure on the talk shows, but what they really need is to go where the audience is migrating to, and that is the Internet," Jerry Del Colliano, a University of Southern California music-industry professor, told The Associated Press.)
Robert Thompson, the Syracuse University pop culture expert, doubts things will come to that: "When you think about the shows we loved best ... they were told by brilliant writers," he told Multichannel News.
But the earlier strike -- which began March 7 of that year, lasted 22 weeks, postponed the beginning of the 1988-89 TV season and cost an estimated $500 million -- gave rise to a group of low-budgeted shows, including "America's Most Wanted," "Cops" and "America's Favorite Home Videos," which became the forerunners of the reality show trend.
Reality shows, of course, are now one of TV's most prominent genres.
