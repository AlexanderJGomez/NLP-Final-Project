Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, says he is innocent of the charges a grand jury handed up on Tuesday.
The indictment does not accuse Stevens of accepting bribes, Matt Friedrich, the acting assistant attorney general, emphasized in a news conference announcing the charges.
This indictment does not allege that."
"Apparently, the media knew about it before he did," Inouye said, adding he had just spoken to Stevens, a Republican from Alaska.
In exchange, Stevens "could and did use his official position and his office on behalf of Veco," one of the state's largest employers, the indictment charges.
Allen pleaded guilty in May 2007, paying out more than $400,000 "in corrupt payments" to Alaska officials, the Department of Justice said in announcing the Stevens indictment.
"I, of course, have served with Sen. Stevens my entire congressional career," Reid said.
... How they handle Stevens is certainly up to them.
Another Republican, Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, said, "I have known Ted Stevens for 28 years, and I have always found him to be impeccably honest.
He is the longest-serving Republican senator in history.
