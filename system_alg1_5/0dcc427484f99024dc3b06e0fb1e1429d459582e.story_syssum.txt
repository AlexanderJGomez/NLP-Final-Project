Luckily, the ancient city of Babylon is outside the extremists' grasp, south of Baghdad.
"This wasn't Saddam's," said Adnan Abu Fatima.
"It belonged to our grandfathers, the Babylonians."
The artifacts, some of the oldest in ancient civilization, are from the "age of ignorance," ISIS says, before the advent of Islam.
Baghdad's museum was plundered, during a lapse in U.S. security, and the priceless artifacts were smuggled around the world.
"Babylon is our soul."
It's a soul under assault by latter day barbarians, who have destroyed much of it in the North, which has been out of the defensive reach of Iraqi soldiers.
