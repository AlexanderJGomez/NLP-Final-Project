Abdel Hadi earned her PhD exploring the use of crayfish as chicken feed.
"The group of chickens [that we raised] on crayfish have stronger bones, have a higher optical density of meat.
As a result, Abdel Hadi says, her experiments show that chickens raised on a crayfish feed diet lay more, stronger, higher-protein eggs.
"Theoretically, it is possible to use crayfish remains, but they would be in such short supply it would not be a feasible solution.
However, it could be better for a niche market," he says.
