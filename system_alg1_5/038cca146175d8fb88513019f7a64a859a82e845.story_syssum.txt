Van Marjwik's side next play Germany, who beat Portugal 1-0 in Lviv thanks to Mario Gomez's second-half goal, in a game that never matched the drama of Denmark's victory.
Before he was introduced in the second half, Huntelaar could only watch as Robin van Persie's eye for a goal went missing.
Van Persie should have scored early on in the game but put his shot wide and later on in the first half the Arsenal striker was thwarted by Danish goalkeeper Stephan Andersen's alertness.
Saturday's second game had been billed as one of the most intriguing of the Euro 2012's group stages but it rarely failed to live up to the pre-match hype.
But it was Gomez who finally broke the deadlock, connecting with Sami Khedira's cross from the right, cleverly guiding a header past Patricio.
