Their destination: the Malaysian Embassy.
They're lying to us," the man repeated.
Around midnight, more than one hundred relatives staged a pre-dawn sit-in outside the embassy gates.
Throughout the sit-in, no Malaysian diplomat came out to meet with protesters.
"We just want them to stop breaking their promises again and again," said Steven Wang, a spokesman for the families, whose mother went missing when the Boeing 777 disappeared on March 8.
The Malaysia Airlines crisis, which has involved the highly emotional disappearance of 153 Chinese nationals who were on board the plane, has put Chinese authorities in an uncomfortable position.
On Friday a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, Qin Gang, called on the families protesting outside the embassy to "express their appeals in a legal and rational way" while pledging to give them further assistance.
