Only the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and its al Qaeda backers would want that, it seems.
"We are now closer than ever to a regional war in the Middle East," said Paulo SÃ©rgio Pinheiro, who heads the U.N.
Then, the United States and Iran held "very brief discussions" about Iraq and the threat posed by ISIS on the sidelines of nuclear negotiations in Vienna, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said.
A host of experts agree, including Meghan O'Sullivan, a former deputy national security adviser during the Iraq war.
Whether the United States likes it or not, working with Iran on the Iraq crisis might be a necessary evil, retired Maj. Gen. James "Spider" Marks said.
"I can just imagine what our friends in the region, our allies will be thinking by reaching out to Iran at a time when they continue to pay for terrorists and foster terrorism not only in Syria, in Lebanon but in Israel as well," the Ohio Republican told reporters.
Rouhani then denied that happened, but said he would be open to helping if asked, according to Iranian state TV.
"If we start flying airplanes, it makes some sense to talk to the Iranians about what we're doing so they don't shoot us down and we don't bomb them," he said.
