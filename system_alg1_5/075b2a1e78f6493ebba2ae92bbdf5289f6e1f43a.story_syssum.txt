Harold Henthorn, 58, appeared before a federal judge in Denver on Thursday to face a first-degree murder charge in the death of Toni Henthorn, who died after falling off a cliff in Rocky Mountain National Park in September 2012.
The couple also had a daughter, who is now 9, said Toni Henthorn's brother Todd Bertolet.
A federal indictment says Harold Henthorn "willfully, deliberately, maliciously, and with premeditation and malice" killed Toni Henthorn, a 50-year-old ophthalmologist.
Authorities are now re-investigating the 1995 death of Harold Henthorn's first wife, Sandra Lynn Henthorn.
"We can only say that there is an open, active investigation into the death of his first wife," said Deborah Sherman, a spokeswoman for the Douglas County Sheriff's Office.
His sister was living in Mississippi when she met Henthorn on the Internet, and he was in Colorado, Bertolet said.
It was almost like whatever he said, went," Bertolet said.
If convicted in the death of Toni Henthorn, Harold Henthorn faces life in prison without parole and up to a $250,000 fine.
