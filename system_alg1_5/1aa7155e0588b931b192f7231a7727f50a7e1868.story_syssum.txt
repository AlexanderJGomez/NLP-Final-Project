"My uncle killed by sniper in WW2," Moore tweeted.
Snipers aren't heroes.
"My dad always said, 'Snipers are cowards.
But Moore stressed that his comments were not a jab at the movie "American Sniper," which earned $105 million in weekend ticket sales and nabbed six Academy Award nominations last week, including best picture.
"I didn't say a word about 'American Sniper' in my tweets," Moore wrote on Facebook.
"American Sniper" is based on the best-selling memoir of the same name by Chris Kyle.
Kyle was shot and killed by a former Marine in 2013.
