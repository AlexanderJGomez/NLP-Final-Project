Spraying chemical dispersants on the slick, as BP has, is one way to remove oil from the surface.
Instruments lowered from a research ship in the gulf have detected large oil plumes near the leak, more than 3,000 feet down.
While we have some understanding of how much oil is sitting at the surface and where it is heading, we have virtually no idea how much oil and dispersants are drifting below the surface of the gulf, nor do we know where these pollutants are going.
Close to the source, where oil-droplet concentrations are high, it may be possible to map the plumes using sound waves, but dissolved chemicals, such as dispersants, cannot be detected with such acoustic methods at all.
Varying ocean currents, such as tides and eddies, move the plume patches around continuously and randomly, and cause the plumes to spread.
Therefore, it is crucial that the amount of oil leaking into the gulf be estimated accurately.
And monitoring the circulation should continue even after the oil leak has been stopped, until the oil has dispersed sufficiently so as not to pose any further biological risk.
