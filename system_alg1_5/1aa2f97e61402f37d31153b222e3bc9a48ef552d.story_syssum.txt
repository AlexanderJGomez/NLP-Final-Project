So here is the situation.
Not least thanks to media interest and a host of events, at which it has been snapped up variously at gatherings for students, business people, football fans, environmentalists and political activists, it has gone within four days of publication to Number 1 in the UK hardback non-fiction charts.
As my former Downing Street colleague, now of Portland PR, Steve Morris, said at the launch: "If you write a book called 'Winners' and it goes straight to the charity shops, don't be surprised if people call you a loser."
The problem is women, or more precisely how I talk about them.
At my next outing, in front of the amazingly bright international postgrad students at Hult International Business School, with Grace not there to heckle, but Fiona sitting three yards from me, the same question came again almost word for word.
I thought that was quite good, and dare I say a rather decent soundbite.
At my next event, a Labour fundraiser, thankfully neither Fiona nor Grace could make it.
You can't win, said I.
So come on.
And the next time I sit down with CNN's woman winners, Christiane or Becky, I need to have a better answer than the ones I have been deploying thus far.
