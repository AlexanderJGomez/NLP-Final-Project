At the beginning of this month, six crews set off on the first leg of the grueling race in Alicante, Spain.
"Our main concern was survival in the first race," says Alec Honey, who competed in 1973-74, when the event begun.
Erik Pascoli, who skippered 'Tauranga' in 1973-74, remembers how on some yachts crates of beer were even included in the supplies so the sailors could enjoy a drink.
"Our instrument of navigation wasn't so far from James Cook's times," says Pascoli.
"We knew there were whales, we knew there were icebergs, we knew there were storms," says Peter Lunde, the skipper of the 1981-82 entrant 'Berge Viking'.
"It's easy to say that winning the race is the priority," says Ken Read, skipper of 'Puma Ocean Racing, powered by BERG'.
No fresh food is taken on board, only freeze dried goods are eaten by crewmen and woman, who are also unlikely to get sufficient sleep while competing.
In each port, separate small races are being held, giving the teams the opportunity to win points, and the event the chance to win over more spectators.
"No matter what you do with it .. you can never destroy adventure, icebergs, waves, cold and no sleep.
You will never destroy the adventure that started this race in 1973."
