GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala (CNN) -- When Guatemalan laborer Faustino Morales fell from a scaffold in February, the response from volunteer firefighters was immediate.
"I rode out with a busy company that ran multiple calls a day, mostly involving crashes, shootings, stabbings ... a lot of violence," said Embleton, 48.
Knowing they could have had a better chance of survival with basic pre-hospital care, Embleton, a captain paramedic firefighter from Washington state, saw an opportunity to help.
The firefighters, in turn, asked him to hold a class for them.
"Basic techniques that firefighters had outside of Guatemala, we'd never learned, and we wanted to learn."
"Things have improved drastically since our program began," said Embleton.
"We've moved out to the country to support an indigenous Mayan community where the needs are great," Embleton said.
"The firefighters have the motivation, and you get a heart for it because you see how well we have it in the States," Embleton said.
"You see all the good that it does," said Embleton.
