In a statement published Friday, security firm IntelCrawler said the breach was the result of malware that infected Target's payment system and possibly compromised the systems of other retailers.
"Well, we should be worried.
And they manipulate or mutate this malware, and then reuse it," SecureState CEO Ken Stasiak said.
"The numbers could be staggering, really, because what the retailers are looking at are potential class action lawsuits," CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said.
All 40 million may have been damaged in some way, and under law they can all be joined together in a class action lawsuit."
