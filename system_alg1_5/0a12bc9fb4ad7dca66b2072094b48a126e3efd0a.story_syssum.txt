Lynnette "Squeaky" Fromme appears in court in Los Angeles, California, in December 1969.
In a 1987 interview with CNN affiliate WCHS, Fromme, then housed in West Virginia, recalled the president "had his hands out and was waving ... and he looked like cardboard to me.
She said she knew Ford was in town and near her, "and I said, 'I gotta go and talk to him,' and then I thought, 'That's foolish.
No, I don't.
"My argument to the jury was, if she wanted to kill him, she would have shot him," John Virga, a Sacramento attorney appointed to defend Fromme, told CNN on Tuesday.
Fromme was sentenced to life in prison, but parole was an option at the time, although the federal system later abolished it, said Felicia Ponce, spokeswoman for the Bureau of Prisons.
Fromme was not granted parole until July 2008, Ponce said.
At the time, prison officials said they were looking into rumors that Fromme escaped after hearing Manson was ill, according to news reports.
If Fromme had killed the president, no one would have listened to her, he said.
And she wasn't, he said, recalling that Fromme was very cooperative during her trial and describing her as "a bright, intelligent young woman" from a middle-class family.
In the 1978 interview, Fromme called Manson "a once-in-a-lifetime soul.
"He's got everything he wants coming from me, 'cause he gave me everything."
"I wish her the best, and hope everything works out for her, and hope she stays out of trouble," he said.
She's been in prison a long time ... it was, in my mind, a tragedy that she wound up a disciple of Manson."
