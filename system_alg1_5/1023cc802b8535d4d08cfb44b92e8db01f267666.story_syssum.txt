Haines, 44, is a longtime aid worker who has helped victims of conflict since 1999, ACTED said.
The threats on David Haines' life are intolerable," the aid group said in a statement.
As logistics manager, Haines had been in charge of procuring humanitarian goods for people staying at the Atmeh camp, Tomarchio said.
The group does have relief activities in Syria that are managed from a distance, he said.
"But I can assure you that we will look at every possible option to protect this person."
