A suspected U.S. drone strike killed 20 people in North Waziristan, a region along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, a Pakistani intelligence official told CNN Friday.
In the incident, which occurred shortly after 10 p.m., two missiles struck the compound in the residential area followed by another four missiles that were fired 10 minutes later, the officer said.
Pakistan will continue to press the U.S. administration to stop drone attacks, Qamar Zaman Kaira, Pakistan's minister for information and broadcasting, said after the Clinton apology.
The U.S. military routinely offers no comment on reported drone strikes.
