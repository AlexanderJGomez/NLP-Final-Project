(CNN) -- I am black, though for most of my life, I've heard from various people that I wasn't.
"I don't even know what that means," Wilson, who has mixed-race parentage, told a press conference yesterday after his team rallied from a two-week losing streak to beat the Carolina Panthers.
Lately, though, issues of black cultural authenticity have poked into broader public view; likely as part of the widening space for racial dialogue opened by Barack Obama's election as president, if not set off by it: Hard to remember now, but some black Americans questioned back in 2008 whether the son of a Kenyan man and a white woman could be considered as authentically rooted to the black American experience as those whose racial background went back generations on this country's soil.
There's also a gay nerd-outcast named Lionel, who wears a retrograde Afro hairstyle so big as to be compared to a weather system, listens to Mumford & Sons, loves Robert Altman movies and, as he puts it, "isn't black enough" for either the black or the white students.
It's a truth that "Black-ish," the new ABC sitcom, pokes at with, so far, erratic results.
The most intriguing, revelatory moments in "Black-ish" are, thus, the smaller, more offhanded ones, most especially in the debut episode in which the two youngest children in the Johnson household say they can't see the significance of Barack Obama being the first black president because they've never lived in a time when there were white ones.
Others may prefer that all of us, within and beyond the black community, feel empowered enough to tell each other what we really mean.
