"Absolutely," James said.
Sports Illustrated's website has a "LeBron James Watch" blog, ESPN.com has a "LeBron Tracker" page devoted to his next move, and the Cleveland Plain Dealer's site has a "LeBron-O-Meter" that swings with each stay-or-go rumor.
"I don't know to that extent, but it will be fun," James said.
James, a six-time NBA all-star, was named the league's MVP for the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 seasons.
"I understand that me going down as one of the greats will not happen until I win a championship," he said.
