On Friday, Universal Studios is opening its "Wizarding World of Harry Potter" attraction at Universal's Islands of Adventure theme park in Orlando, Florida.

"I've grown up with Harry Potter.
Alex agrees, "He's a generational thing; we've grown up with him.
"When I read the last book it was almost like the end, I still had the movies, but I was afraid it would be over, but the park is a way for it to live on."
