Jakes is founder and senior pastor of The Potter's House of Dallas, Texas, a multiracial, nondenominational church with more than 50 outreach ministries.
Today as the church moves from its introspective posture to a broader role in politics, business, media and impacting societal ills, it has the dubious and daunting task of doing so without losing its core function.
I have listened and watched the events of the last few days with great disappointment as the church and the so-called African-American church, in particular, has been painted rather negatively with a broad, wide-ranging brush.
Most, if not all, predominantly African-American church doors are open to all, not just to blacks, but to anyone who is seeking a spiritual home, guidance, support, direction, faith and a feeding of the soul in the purest sense.
The African-American church I know is filled with programs designed to address the many ills that inflict our society: HIV/AIDS, homelessness, reducing the rate of recidivism, assisting with employment and job training, economic development and financial management classes, home buying seminars, food banks to feed the hungry, schools to educate and an active plan to guide our youth.
Of course not.
The Potter's House, though largely African-American, is composed of 20 different nationalities and growing in diversity.
I saw blacks, whites and Hispanics driving up with bags of clothes and food and crying together, trying to accommodate whomever they could, wherever they could.
Who cares what color they are, what banner they fly, what gender they are, or how they pronounce their names?
To be sure, there is still work to do to defeat racism and to attain justice in our country for all.
If we do not, we will have done a terrible disservice to our coming generations.
My hope is that the church remains a vibrant part of our process, sounding the alarm that warns: America, please wake up out of our sleep!
