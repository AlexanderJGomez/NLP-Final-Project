His friend George Underwood takes up the story.
Frampton's son Peter joined the school three years after George and David and was soon in search of musical companions.
"No one at that time was into American football in those days.
George says David convinced him that the girl wouldn't turn up for the meeting.
I knew David wouldn't fight me and I was so annoyed I just went like that."
"Oh God my stomach was turning," says Underwood.
"When we were on the roads together David's first single 'Space Oddity' went to number 1" says Frampton.
George quit music to focus on art and David asked him to work on three of his most famous album covers -- "David Bowie," "Hunky Dory" and "Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars."
"I can't thank him enough for asking me.
Underwood says he wasn't concerned about Bowie's 10-year absence from recording.
But he's the same guy I went to school with."
