That Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton were teammates, from the Mercedes stable, made it all the more enthralling.
"Of course there have been clouds," he told Formula One's official website.
"Sure it was not suffering in any way, but for me individually I want to win and if I don't win it sucks.
But I am not dwelling on the past.
"We have a relationship that goes up and down and it will continue to go up and down," he explained.
"Of course with time, and the situation, the skin grows thicker.
Yes, there have been challenging times, but from my point of view I always felt comfortable, and it continues like that."
"We chose a strategy of 'let them race,'" he explained.
There will again be times of discussion, sure.
"Before we start that discussion: we have to provide them with a car that gives them the tool to fight for the championship," he said.
I have no doubt about that," he said.
No stress.
