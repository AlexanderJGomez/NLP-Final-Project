Itta's garden, the Arctic Ocean, is filled with the whales, seals, walruses and fish the Inupiat Eskimos still need to survive.
"I struggled with myself and prayed a lot," says Itta.
"If Shell really hits it big this summer, I think things will heat up even more," Reiss told CNN.
"Even one time I said, 'I'm going to fight this, and they will have to do it over my dead body.'
"We are the Arctic, because we are the land, we are the ocean we are one and the same," says Itta.
"We will be drilling these wells like they are the most complex, most difficult wells that we have drilled in company history," says Pete Slaiby, the vice president of Shell Alaska.
The Arctic's shallow waters will make a Gulf of Mexico scenario less likely, supporters say, because getting to the well will be easier and pressure conditions underwater at the drill site will be more favorable.
Shell has been forced to postpone drilling, which was scheduled to begin this month, until August by an unexpectedly thick ice pack.
If a "blowout occurs late in the drilling season, there won't be time to stop it before the winter ice chokes the site, leaving oil to gush uncontrolled for months."
Growing up, he had no electricity, no running water.
If production dips from the region's Prudhoe Bay wells and pipeline, "our tax revenues go way, way, way down," Itta admits.
"So that's the point where I said, 'OK, it's a compromise.'
We have to give."
