As a community health nurse, he relies on his two-wheeled companion to reach the isolated villages dotting the Combo Central region in The Gambia, West Africa.
He checks them for any warning signs and, if needed, refers them to the nearest health center.
"I received this motorcycle four years ago when it was brand new and I have ridden until now over 50,000 kilometers," says Jallow, whose work covers more than 10,000 people in 13 villages.
It estimates that some 12,000 children in the continent die daily from illnesses and conditions such as pneumonia, diarrhea, measles, malaria and malnutrition.
"Barry came back and said there are children in rural communities who really need to be reached because they need immunizations; women are dying in childbirth and then 30, 20, 10 miles away in ministry of health car parks there are motorcycles and ambulances that are simply broken because nobody has been trained to repair them, there's no supply chain of parts, there's no knowledge of transport maintenance," remembers Andrea, a mother of three and former motorcycle racer.
In one year, RFH says, mobilized health workers have transported more than 400,000 medical samples and test results between rural health centers and labs.
"We have shown that the maintenance of vehicles is absolutely critical if you are going to be able to solve the health issues of rural Africa," says Andrea.
"They can't do that by walking and it makes me really angry that there isn't more emphasis on making sure that transport runs properly."
