A laboratory in Maryland confirmed the presence of ricin after initial field tests indicated the poison was present, according to Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Terrance Gainer.
Wicker, the junior senator from Mississippi, has been assigned a protective detail, according to a law enforcement source.
"The bottom line is, the process we have in place worked," she said.
The discovery forced 16 employees to go through decontamination procedures, but no one reported any ill effects afterward, Frist said.
Wicker, 61, was first appointed by former Republican Gov.
Before that, he served in the Mississippi Senate.
