With a service called TV Everywhere, Comcast and Time Warner will give cable subscribers access to "premium" television content via broadband, and later cellphone connections.
(Of course, as consumers adopt TV Everywhere, they can probably expect price increases.)
However, given the choice between Hulu and TV Everywhere, television programmers have an incentive to go with the latter.
As a result, consumers will be the losers.
"There will be some part [of Time Warner's content] that will be out there [on Hulu], said Bewkes.
However, only cable subscribers will be able to access other content online -- through officially licensed avenues, anyway.
They don't have to pay for these services, yet they do.
