Hudner, who received the Medal of Honor for trying to pull Brown from his downed plane during the Korean War, will fly to Pyongyang on Saturday and is hoping to return to the area his comrade crashed.
On December 4, 1950, Hudner, now 88, was part of a six-plane formation providing air support for U.S. Marines on the ground fighting Chinese troops during the Korean War.
Hudner refused to leave him.
If the Chinese troops didn't claim Hudner, the Korean winter would.
United Nations forces, made up primarily of U.S. personnel, fought on the side of South Korea.
Of the 15,000 U.S. troops involved, more than 3,000 died during the 17-day struggle.
He puts the chances of finding Brown's remains or his aircraft at 50-50, but says it is important.
"Of course, that olive branch has to be extended and accepted by both sides," said Hudner.
The timing of the invitation to the U.S. veterans is likely intentional, but for Hudner, the focus is bringing closure to his Korean War experiences and to Brown's family.
