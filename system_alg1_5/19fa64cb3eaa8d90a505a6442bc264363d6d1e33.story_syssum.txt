Earlier, the first substantive review of the controversy by the IRS showed the agency used multiple lists of inappropriate criteria in assessing tax-exempt applications up until this month, more than a year later than previously revealed.
In a statement, the Michigan Democrat  questioned why the Treasury inspector general who initially disclosed the IRS targeting, J. Russell George, focused only on BOLO lists that contained conservative labels.
However, Werfel's review showed that other inappropriate lists continued to be used until as recently as this month by the unit that handles tax-exempt applications.
He immediately suspended use of any BOLO lists by the unit that handles tax-exempt applications, his review said.
.
The IRS admitted there was unfair targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status starting in 2010, but officials said the action was a bureaucratic shortcut in its Cincinnati office rather than an exercise of political bias.
In his report that disclosed the misconduct, George said there was no evidence of a political motive.
Confusion over defining what constitutes political activity versus social welfare activity contributed to the targeting by the IRS, Werfel said.
Werfel said the IRS would continue checking on tax-exempt groups to ensure they were following the law.
