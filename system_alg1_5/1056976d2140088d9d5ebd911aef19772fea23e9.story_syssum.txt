ET, the newspaper reported.
Powell was convicted in the 1999 murder of Stacie Reed and the rape of her 14-year-old sister in their Manassas, Virginia, family home.
Stacie Reed knew Powell, then 20 and an admitted racist.
"Since I have already been indicted on first degree murder and the Va. Supreme Court said that I can't be charged with capital murder again, I figured I would tell you the rest of what happened on Jan. 29, 1999, to show you how stupid all of y'all ... are," wrote Powell, who is white.
He admitted pinning the victim, threatening to rape her, then stabbing her in the heart when the girl resisted.
The killer also said that after that crime, he waited in the house until the younger girl returned from school, then attacked her, leaving her for dead.
He again was convicted, and federal and state courts subsequently upheld the conviction on appeal.
