"Nobody wanted more," he said.
"[She] thanked me profusely, and as I left she said, 'Now we can have something fresh to eat,' " Oppenheimer recalled.
The experience ultimately led Oppenheimer, 57, to create a way for gardeners across the country to easily share their excess produce with hungry families in their communities.
He reached out to food pantries across the country through social networking, food banks, master gardeners, faith organizations and other groups to encourage them to sign up for inclusion in his database of food pantries.
"The country is loaded with gardeners who have more food than they can possibly themselves use," Oppenheimer said.
"AmpleHarvest.org gives them the ability to easily, quickly get that food to somebody who genuinely, really needs it."
"That's the food that ... we can get into the system to help diminish hunger in the country."
[At] the grocery store, the food's expensive, and it's hard to buy the healthier foods because we don't always have the money," Lesko said.
