Twelve states have contacted the CDC for assistance in investigating clusters of enterovirus: Alabama, Colorado, Michigan, Georgia, Ohio, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Kentucky and Utah.
Dr. Christine Nyquist, medical director of infection control at Children's Hospital Colorado, said the hospital sent around 25 samples to the CDC from patients with respiratory illness.
"It's important to remember that these infections are very common," said Dr. Anne Schuchat.
"It's one that we don't know as much about as we would like," Schuchat said.
"That's the scary part -- the unpredictability, I think," Nyquist said.
"We've had to mobilize other providers, doctors, nurses.
It's big," she said.
"Many infections will be mild and self-limited, requiring only symptomatic treatment," it said.
"It's not usually fatal, thank God for that," Schuchat said.
The majority of the children who have been hospitalized with the virus, at least on the samples the CDC tested, did have asthma to start with.
It's just the nature of kids," Jackson said.
"This is the worst I've seen in my time here at Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children," Dr. Raju Meyeppan told the outlet.
His mother, Jennifer, called 911 when her son's breathing became shallow, and her son was airlifted to the Denver hospital, she told KUSA.
"We're having a hard time believing that it really happened," she added.
Blessing Hospital in Quincy, Illinois, saw more than 70 children with respiratory issues last weekend, and seven of them were admitted, CNN affiliate WGEM reported.
Clusters of the virus have struck Asia, Europe and the United States from 2008 to 2010, and the infection caused relatively mild to severe illness, with some intensive care and mechanical ventilation, the health agency said.
