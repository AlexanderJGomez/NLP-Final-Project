Washington (CNN) -- Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan took a pragmatic approach to the issue of late-term abortion when working as a top lawyer in the Clinton White House, documents released Friday show.
In a February 27, 1997 memo to top White House staff, Kagan notes a leading abortion rights supporter had just admitted late-term abortions were being "performed more frequently than pro-choice groups have acknowledged, and often perfonned [sic - performed] on healthy women with healthy fetuses," repeating a claim conservatives at the time had long made.
Some 160,000 pages of documents are being reviewed from Kagan's four-years in the Clinton White House from 1995-1999, during which she also served as deputy associate counsel.
Kagan appeared to view her role in the Domestic policy office as both a lawyer and political adviser, worrying that both  Democrats and Republicans could back away from the legislation.
"We should enable the companies to agree on this," wrote Kagan.
"Elena Kagan has also demonstrated her disdain for the unborn, the most vulnerable in our society."
At the time, the Clinton administration had to decide whether to continue the legal challenge in federal courts.
