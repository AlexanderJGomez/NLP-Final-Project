While the exact number of hours owed by Tevez has not been made public, he must complete his punishment within the 12 months of it being handed out.
Meanwhile, Tevez revealed his delight Thursday at being handed the iconic number 10 shirt following the completion of his move to Turin.
"I'm absolutely aware of the great effort Juventus Football Club has made to bring me here," he told reporters.
"Obviously I didn't want to forget Del Piero, who was the last player to wear number 10.
"I want to be very clear and honest," he said.
"Real Madrid incorporates a new project with one of the best Spanish football players," the club said in a statement.
