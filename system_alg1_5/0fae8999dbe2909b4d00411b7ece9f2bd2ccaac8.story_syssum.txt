Asked if she had used it since then, she said, "I'm sure I have, but it's been a very long time."
Deen attorney William Franklin's motion, filed Monday with the U.S. District Court in Savannah, cited the June 26 Supreme Court decision in Hollingsworth v. Perry, the California case.
Lisa Jackson, the plaintiff in the suit against Deen is white, has no standing because she couldn't have suffered "a personal and tangible harm" from hearing the "N-word" on the job, the Franklin's , motion says.
Jackson is a former manager at Deen's restaurants in Savannah, Georgia.
"This lawsuit has never been about the N-word," she said.
"I believe that every creature on this Earth, every one of God's creatures, was created equal," she said.
