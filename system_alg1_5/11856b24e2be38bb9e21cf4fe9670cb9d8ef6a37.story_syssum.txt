WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Barack Obama, who shot from obscurity to fame based on a single speech and then captured the White House in a campaign marked by soaring rhetoric, delivered a restrained, sober inaugural address Tuesday.
But other than mentioning "the lash of the whip," an echo of Lincoln's towering second inaugural address, and "gathering clouds and raging storms," Obama did not seem to quote the 16th president.
"That we are in the midst of a crisis is now well-understood," Obama said, in a speech that warned Americans to prepare for a long, hard -- but certain -- slog toward better days.
No, Obama seemed to respond 28 years later, "The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works.
And his conclusion bookended the two great sources of quotes in the English language, Shakespeare and the Bible.
