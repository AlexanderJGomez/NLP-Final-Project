Hollister, a popular clothing store owned by Abercrombie & Fitch in the fashionable Soho neighborhood, remained closed Friday after a bedbug infestation was found earlier in the week, according to company spokeswoman Iska Hain.
"We've had them in banks, grocery stores, movie theaters, judge's chambers, schools, dentists' offices -- everywhere," said Jeff Eisenberg of PestAway, an exterminating company in Manhattan.
However, such statistics represent only a fraction of bedbug cases in the city, as they come almost exclusively from buildings in the rental market.
"People buy a shirt, leave it hanging in their apartment, a bug gets on it, and then they go to work."
"It would be cost prohibitive on both sides," Rosenthal said.
Despite their name, bedbugs need not live in beds.
