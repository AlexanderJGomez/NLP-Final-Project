It's not surprising; it's Vogue.
The truth is that we can't blame Mayer, or Vogue, for society's obsession with, and response to, appearance.
The debate over Mayer's culpability in agreeing to be sexed up for a fashion magazine implies that she has some power over the fact, some ability to change the truth, that looks matter, and that pretty people succeed more.
But it's unrealistic, and unfair, to expect that Mayer wouldn't sit for a photo that wasn't expected to turn out at least somewhat flattering.
That's not self-validation, or even narcissism.
