The first is the primacy effect, and the second is using your opponent's language against him.
He lacked passion in the previous debate, but when answering the first question from the audience Tuesday night, Obama brought the heat.
But for me, it's the primacy effect taking off.
Obama used Romney's language against him time and time again, and it was effective.
It's a timeless, winning strategy.
It was Romney's best moment of the debate.
It's good for Romney that this wasn't the first debate, because Obama's performance was much stronger Tuesday night.
Think about it: If we simply reversed the order of the debates, the race for president would look very different right now.
