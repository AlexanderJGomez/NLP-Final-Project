(CNN) -- Pirates seized control of a cargo vessel near the Seychelles Thursday, one of two attacks that took place within minutes of each other off the coast of east Africa, according to the European Union Naval Force.
A Belgium warship, part of the EU force, responded to the attack, which caused no casualties.
Pirate attacks off the coast of east Africa have significantly increased this year, according to the International Maritime Bureau, which monitors shipping crimes.
Eight others were wounded, four more killed and one is missing, the bureau said.
Ninety-five percent of America's foreign trade, for instance, moves by water, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration.
But because of the presence of naval vessels, the success rate of the pirates have decreased," said Cyrus Mody, manager of the International Maritime Bureau.
With the ransoms they collect, pirates can earn up to $40,000 a year, analysts say.
But at the same time, from the owner's point of view, there is no other way currently to secure the safe release of the vessel along with the crew and the cargo," Mody said.
