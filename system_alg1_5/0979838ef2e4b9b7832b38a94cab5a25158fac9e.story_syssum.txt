"Mr. Tressel has the personality and leadership skills, in addition to widespread community support, to dramatically raise YSU's profile and prominence across Ohio and the nation," board Chairman Sudershan Garg said in a statement.
Those actions alone violate NCAA rules, but it's how Tressel acted -- and didn't act -- that really drew the ire of the NCAA, the nation's dominant intercollegiate sports organization.
"Of great concern to the committee was the fact that (Tressel) became aware of these violations and decided not to report the violations to institutional officials, the Big Ten Conference or the NCAA," the NCAA Division 1 Committee on Infractions said in a report issued in December 2011.
"It's been very polarized," Slavens said.
The student government leader said he thinks Tressel, as president, would excel at "being a cheerleader, the face of the university (because) he knows the area and donors" and expressed confidence he can craft "a vision" for Youngstown State and its future.
But, at the same time, things could quickly turn south -- just like Tressel's time at Ohio State.
