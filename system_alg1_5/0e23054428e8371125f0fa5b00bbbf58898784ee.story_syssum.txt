A die-hard feminist, my desire for self-sufficiency didn't stem from a movement: It was personal.
Then, I met "Tom," who was much older and more successful than me.
Before I knew it, I was being sucked into his vortex.
Or at least, that's how I felt.
He was not at all a bad person, but increasingly, I was starting to feel owned and that I was losing myself.
I know that if I fall onto hard times, he'll support me, and I will do the same.
In a span of a lifetime, my relationship with Tom was a mere blip.
