Incedal is accused of possessing documents that refer to bomb making which, according to the prosecution, were found on an SD card hidden between an iPhone and its protective case.
His iPhone had been used to carry out Internet searches for "ISIS" and "Sham," the court heard, the latter being a reference to Syria.
One document found at Incedal's home had a reference to "Plan," which looks like a checklist including "1 month surveillance," "rent flat nearby," "uniform," and "tools and materials," prosecutors said.
More than 160 people were killed in November 2008 when 10 Pakistani gunmen associated with the terror group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba stormed buildings in Mumbai, India.
