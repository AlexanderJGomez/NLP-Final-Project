The Liberian-flagged Biscaglia came under "sustained and heavy attack" early Friday morning, Nick Davis, Director of Anti-Piracy Maritime Security Solutions (APMSS), said in a statement.
All three were unhurt, Davis said.
The vessel is believed to be on its way to an anchorage in Puntland, northeastern Somalia, Davis said.
The most high-profile hijacking so far came earlier this month, when pirates seized a Saudi oil tanker carrying $100 million worth of oil and a crew of 25, although that attack occurred outside the pirates' normal operational range, 450 nautical miles southeast of Mombasa, Kenya.
"The pirates are living between life and death," said the pirate leader, identified by only one name, Boyah.
The interview was conducted in August by journalists working for the Somali news organization, Garowe.
