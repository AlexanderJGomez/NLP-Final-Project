Atlanta, Georgia (CNN)  -- A third beluga whale belonging to the world's largest aquarium has died, the Georgia Aquarium announced late Monday.
Nico arrived in Atlanta with Gaspar, two whales obtained from a park in Mexico.
The belugas are not the only high-profile deaths at the Georgia Aquarium, which opened in late 2005.
A pair of whale sharks have also died at the eight-million-gallon facility, the only one outside Asia to display the giant fish.
