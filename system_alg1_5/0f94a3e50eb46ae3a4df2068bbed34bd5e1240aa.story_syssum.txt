In presidential politics, very little is random.
"There is a whole swath of voters out there who obviously know of Hillary Clinton and understand who the Clintons are, but they don't know of her as the politician, they don't know the specifics about her time in the White House," Kirsten Kukowski, spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, said.
Details about the Clinton White House years is not old news for people who were in "grade school" at the time, she said.
Republicans, however, feel they can still define her on their terms.
"While a lot people assume everyone knows Hillary, people under 30 don't know specifics," Kukowski said.
Top Republican strategists, like Karl Rove, have shown how Republican might try to bring up Clinton's age and health in a campaign.
The strategy worked, however, as it dominated news about Clinton for two days.
That time appears to be over.
Miller, whose super PAC has a cadre of researchers diving into the Clinton record, said there will be an obvious focus on what younger voters need to know about her time in the White House.
"I do think that for the generation that didn't live through that, that there is some value having the discussion," he added.
"What happens is often times if you don't introduce yourself, then you are leaving that task to the opposition," said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist and Romney spokesman.
Republicans say that is only because of the unprecedented shadow campaign around Clinton right now.
