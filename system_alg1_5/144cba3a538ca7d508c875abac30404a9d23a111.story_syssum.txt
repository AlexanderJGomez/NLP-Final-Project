For months, Miller has argued that the VA is too reluctant to fire executives, especially those connected to delays in veterans care.
Miller's proposal is a strong statement, but it would affect a relatively small group of federal workers.
There are roughly 360 senior executives at Veterans Affairs, according to the Office of Personnel Management.
But, the trend over the past five years shows a substantial difference at the VA. From 2008-2013, the VA fired executives at a rate one-fourth the firing rate for government overall, according to the OPM data.
"What happens is the politics get ahead of the facts," said Joe Kaplan, an attorney who has worked on federal workers' cases for more than 30 years.
She did, and was not fired.
"It's really important in a political system to maintain a third party review of personnel actions," said Max Stier, president of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service which focuses on strengthening civil service.
But he argues that Congress needs to revamp the entire, outdated federal personnel policy for the government, not just make a sudden change at the VA.
Miller insists that as it is now, the VA is not a meritocracy.
But for now, Shinseki has no plans to fire himself, saying he isn't resigning.
"I will do everything I can," Shinseki demurred.
"That's not the question," replied Begich.
