(CNN) -- After an extensive, month-long buildup, Yahoo has finally unveiled its new logo.
"We knew we wanted a logo that reflected Yahoo - whimsical, yet sophisticated.
In a recent internal poll of Yahoo employees, 87% wanted the logo changed, Mayer said.
"Sharing these logo variations prepares people for change, so there's less risk of what happened to Gap," said David Airey, a graphic designer specializing in brand identity.
Yahoo's logo redesign was headed up by an in-house branding group and product designers, according to AdAge.
On Twitter, the reaction to the logo was less than enthusiastic.
It'll just need to be freshened up," said Airey.
