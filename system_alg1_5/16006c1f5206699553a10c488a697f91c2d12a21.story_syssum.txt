Yvonne, who didn't give her last name, started by telling me that she had been able to get off Medicaid in the past year.
Yvonne, 35, told me she works part-time as a hairstylist assistant.
Let me try to explain: In a state that has chosen not to expand Medicaid, Yvonne is in the staggering position of now making too much money to qualify for Medicaid, and too little to obtain subsidies through the Affordable Care Act.
South Carolina, and 25 other states, turned it down.
I asked Kentucky Senate hopeful Matt Bevin, a Republican, who was against the expansion in his state, about this.
For the time being, the money comes from the federal government.
"This is just politics," he added.
She can't get subsidies, Medicaid or health insurance.
