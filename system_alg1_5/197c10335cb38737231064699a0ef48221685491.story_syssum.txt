Police are "still actively searching" for Brittany, and believe she and the suspect may be camping in the region, Roanoke County Police Chief Ray Lavinder told reporters.
Brittany is believed to be with Easley, who met the girl's mother on the internet, authorities said.
Easley and Brittany are believed to have bought several other items at a Salem, Virginia, Walmart before they disappeared.
Authorities launched a search for the seventh-grader Monday after officers found the body of Brittany's mother, Tina Smith, 41, inside the family's Salem home.
Brittany was afraid her mother's live-in boyfriend "would come over and take her away and hurt her mom," Rebecca Kilian, 13, told the Times on Tuesday.
Police are "confident" that the girl is with Easley, Lavinder said.
Nobody seemed to know where she was," said Roanoke County Police Lt. Chuck Mason Monday, according to CNN affiliate WSET of Lynchburg, Virginia, adding that police were concerned her disappearance "has something to do with the homicide."
Hall said authorities don't yet have a specific search area, as they are uncertain which direction Easley might be heading or how far he might have gotten.
