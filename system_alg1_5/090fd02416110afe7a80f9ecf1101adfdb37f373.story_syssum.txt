I had gone to bed around 4 or 5 a.m. after spending hours on my computer, which was pretty common for me back then, at age 18.
I did not get to use it the first time, but I stayed after school that evening to see if I could get a chance to try it out.
There, I learned of an Explorer Scout group sponsored by IBM.
Finally in 1982, I bought my first computer.
I used my computer and modem to log onto electronic bulletin board systems, or BBS, and create more friendships and acquaintances.
We would share information with each other about any particularly interesting system we connected to and, when we got together for Explorers, we'd talk about exploring, not harming systems.
Then, the FBI showed up at my home.
As I sat before the judge with my lawyer, he asked why he should not give me prison time.
Today, more than 30 years later, I'm still fascinated by computers: I'm employed as a network engineer and, at home, I tinker around on about half a dozen computers.
Today, hacking is a whole different world.
