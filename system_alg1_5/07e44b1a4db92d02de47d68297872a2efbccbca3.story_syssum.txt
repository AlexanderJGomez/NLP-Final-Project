On Tuesday, Alex Sink, a great Democrat running in a special congressional election in Florida, lost.
About 2%.
There's the Republican dogma, bought by beltway pundits and some in the mainstream media, that it was a referendum on Obamacare.
Yes, Republicans pumped money into this race.
What, then, was it about?
Don't be afraid: The Republican message was, as is so often, "be afraid."
It's ironic because from the start, Democrats introduced, pushed for, defended and protected Medicare.
Let's face it, more Republican voters filed and submitted absentee ballots than Democrats, and more turned out on Election Day.
Democrats believe that when more people vote, it's not just good for our party, it's good for democracy.
After all, the Republican in charge of electing Republicans to Congress said before the election, "special elections aren't too predictive for either side going forward."
That was true before Election Day, and it's true today.
