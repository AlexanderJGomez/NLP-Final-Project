At 6'2" and roughly 380 pounds, Mark Rucker once resembled the big, friendly character.
"What he does after this Ironman, I don't know," his wife, Annita Rucker, said with a laugh.
That was not good.
"She was devastated; I was crushed," Rucker said.
Her transformation was his inspiration.
He was tired, sick and unhappy.
"Something clicked," he said.
"I did it to myself.
I AM a runner.
I AM a Beast.
"That was a huge motivator to me," he said.
"The focus he has, the drive he has ... it's so refreshing," Annita Rucker said.
"Now, he's so active with them.
Before this, that never would have happened."
Today is one of those days."
He's a beast, but one who feels pain.
"I'm the guy in the overalls (who's) shoveling the coal in the train," he said.
Rucker wants to become a motivational speaker, to be that inspiration for others that Mills was for him.
"When I was so overweight, I felt so dead to everything," Rucker said.
