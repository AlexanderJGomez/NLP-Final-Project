Los Angeles (CNN) -- The man accused of shooting and paralyzing a U.S. Army soldier at a homecoming party in the soldier's honor faces one count of attempted murder, the spokesman for the San Bernardino, California, district attorney said Tuesday.
He was shot at the party after an "argument and physical confrontation" with Jurado, San Bernardino Police Department Sgt.
Jurado "pulled out a gun and shot him twice," she said.
"Right now, my son is hanging in physically," Suzanne Sullivan told CNN.
"We told him what it was about and he just closed his eyes," Suzanne Sullivan told CNN.
"He's a giver, not a taker, and just wants to be there for and help people.
"I asked Chris if he wanted to me to hang it on the wall or cover him in it," Suzanne Sullivan said.
"He once told me that if defending this country takes his life, so be it," she said.
"We just want justice to be done," she said.
