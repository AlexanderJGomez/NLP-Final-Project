"As a result, they got nothing, and 19 of them were killed."
"They were on scene immediately, well-led and well-coordinated," Allen said.
And Lutfullah Mashal, a spokesman for the National Directorate of Security, said three men arrested in Kabul confessed to plotting to kill Karim Khalil, Afghanistan's second vice president.
In his statement, Allen said, "No one is underestimating the seriousness of today's attacks."
Meanwhile, an airbase used by U.S. troops in the eastern city of Jalalabad, in Naranghar province, also came under attack, the NATO command in Kabul reported.
At least eight civilians were wounded, said a police official at the center, who is not authorized to speak to the media and asked not to be named.
Though the attacks didn't succeed, he said, "The target selection was likely intended to send a message to the U.S., U.K., Russia and the Afghans that this will in fact be a bloody year for all forces in Afghanistan, particularly the east of the country."
"The Afghan National Security Forces responded to the attacks bravely, promptly and effectively, once again illustrating the significant progress that has been made in ensuring that Afghans can look after their own security," Hague said.
A western official in Kabul later said the hotel had been taken over by insurgents, but was then taken back by Afghan national security forces.
