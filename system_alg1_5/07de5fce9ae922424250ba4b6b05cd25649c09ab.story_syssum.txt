Djokovic's family has run the Serbia Open tournament, which was scheduled to take place from April 29 to May 5 in Belgrade, since 2009.
A statement by Djokovic's Family Sport company, the tournament organizers, was posted on the official ATP Tour website to confirm the decision, but without giving any reasons.
Last year, the Serbian duo reached the final, but an abdominal injury to Ivanovic ended their chances.
"We were unfortunate last time, this time we were beaten by a better team," Djokovic said after their defeat.
