The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools is currently reviewing a scathing report, prepared by former federal prosecutor Ken Wainstein, which showed thousands of UNC students took fraudulent classes, some of them multiple times.
One student was enrolled in 19 different paper classes, Wainstein said.
"Lifting diplomas from students who were advised to take these classes is nearly impossible," he said.
But the enrollment in the remedy class was optional, Wheelan said.
One former football player, Mike McAdoo, told CNN earlier this year that his adviser told him to major in AFAM, and then put him in several paper classes, even though he had interest in majoring in something else.
"A good number of these student-athletes were "steered" to the AFAM paper classes by certain academic counselors in ASPSA," Wainstein's report says.
His report says paper classes served as "GPA boosters" for athletes who were on the brink of eligibility.
"I think about where they are, you know, what are they doing," she said, sitting at that same table the next day.
UNC said the Wainstein report came to a different conclusion than previous investigations because he had the cooperation of Nyang'oro and Crowder, who previously weren't talking.
Former head football coach John Bunting, for instance, told investigators he knew of the paper classes.
Reacting Saturday to the report, Williams told reporters "it's a very sad time for me" as not only UNC's head basketball coach, but also a former assistant coach and student there.
