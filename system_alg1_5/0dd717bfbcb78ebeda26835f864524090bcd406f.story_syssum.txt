Super Bowl XLVIII, between the Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks, will be streamed by NFL.com and Fox Sports, but both of those sources will be blocked on the Wi-Fi and cellular networks at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, NFL CIO Michelle McKenna-Doyle told Ars in a phone interview.
This year we planned ahead to do it," McKenna-Doyle said.
At last year's Super Bowl, the Wi-Fi network stayed up even during the infamous mid-game power outage.
While attending the final game of last year's World Series at Fenway Park in Boston, I was able to upload, e-mail, and text photos on the cellular network during the game.
"When you can't do the basics, it's all of a sudden not that cool that you can show replays or stream the game," McKenna-Doyle said.
But that won't be used at this year's game, because multicast streaming isn't commonly supported on smartphones yet, McKenna-Doyle said.
"It depends on the stadium," McKenna-Doyle said.
While it would be possible to provide audio feeds to a mobile app, McKenna-Doyle noted that "We've always given this radio for broadcast, and fans have told us they really love it."
Network monitoring tools divide the stadium into sectors, and this year "we cut the stadium into more sectors than we had in the past so we can pinpoint more quickly where issues are in a section of the stadium," McKenna-Doyle said.
