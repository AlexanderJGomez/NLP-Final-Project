It's completely unacceptable, what he said," Valeriu Nicolae of the Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE) group told CNN Friday.
"Today he reiterated the need for punishment that hits hard against any form of racism," a spokesperson from FIFA's media department said.
"He underlined that fines achieve little, but points deductions and exclusion from competitions would be effective measures.
"Maybe it would be good for Sepp Blatter to spend some time outside of fancy meetings," he said.
"I have great confidence in UEFA," Nicolae said.
Blatter is erratic and I think it's time for him to resign."
"I want to reiterate: this will be impossible to repeat for the FIFA World Cup, and has been acknowledged by the federal government and LOC.
There will be no compromise."
