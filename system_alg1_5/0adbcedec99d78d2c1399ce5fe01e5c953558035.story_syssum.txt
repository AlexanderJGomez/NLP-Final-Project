Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A suspected U.S. drone strike in Pakistan's tribal region killed six suspected militants on Wednesday, intelligence officials told CNN.
"It's unilateral action," he said.
If it is, it's a crude way of getting your message across," he said.
What we are saying is irrespective of tactical games, this is not useful in the long run," he said.
A U.S. official who is not authorized to speak for attribution said there is a "desire to expand cooperation across a wide range of joint activities with the Pakistanis," but would not elaborate on what steps the United States is taking.
"Pakistan needs to talk more about what they're doing and less about what they think the U.S. is doing," the official said.
