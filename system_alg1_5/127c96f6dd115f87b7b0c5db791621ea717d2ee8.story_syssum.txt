(WIRED) -- From the results of the Pwn2Own hacking competition, it looks like Android and Windows Phone 7 are tough nuts to crack.
This year, Microsoft Internet Explorer 8, Apple Safari 5.0.3, Mozilla Firefox, and Google Chrome were the web-browser targets.
There's the safety of the software itself, the exploit mitigations that are already in place for that software, and then the amount of research that has already been conducted (which can speed up the process of writing an actual exploit).
Safari, Chrome, iPhone, Android and Blackberry all use WebKit in their browsers, which means that they are all susceptible to exploitation through the browser -- and that's exactly how the iPhone and Blackberry were attacked.
Android's survival was a bit of a surprise, since it is also a big target and had four contestants lined up.
For those that are out to find the safest phone on the market, Vreugdenhil says you'll want to compare features such as DEP (Data Execution Prevention), ASLR (address space layout randomization), Sandboxing, code signing and the ease with which software can be updated on the device.
