John Travolta's 16-year-old son, Jett, died in the Bahamas in January after having a seizure.
Earlier in the trial, Travolta testified that his son was found unresponsive by a nanny at the home on the island of Grand Bahama, where the family was spending the New Year's holiday.
The paramedic, however, asked Travolta to sign a statement releasing the ambulance company from liability.
Time was of the essence," Travolta testified earlier in the trial.
Lightbourn said Wednesday that he asked attorney Bridgewater to assist him in negotiations with Travolta's attorneys.
Lightbourn said his eyes popped when Travolta's attorney offered him $15 million for the document Travolta signed.
Murrio Ducille, who represents Bridgewater, said to Travolta's attorney, "you came to the island with evil in your heart."
