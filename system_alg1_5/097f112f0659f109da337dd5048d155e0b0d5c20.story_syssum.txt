London (CNN) -- Hans Kristian Rausing, the son of one of the world's richest men, appeared in court Wednesday charged with "preventing the lawful and decent burial" of his wife, Eva, UK media said.
Her death, and the details of subsequent events, are a reminder of the distorted reality of drug addiction," the statement said.
Her father, Tom Kemeny, paid tribute Tuesday to his "beloved daughter."
His daughter eventually recovered in the 1980s and dedicated many of her efforts to helping other addicts, he said, before marrying Rausing, with whom she had four children.
The family statement also appeals for donations in Eva Rausing's name to a drug awareness and treatment fund, or to the UK charity Action on Addiction, which she supported.
They benefited thousands of lives through their personal involvement and philanthropic activities," Kemeny wrote.
