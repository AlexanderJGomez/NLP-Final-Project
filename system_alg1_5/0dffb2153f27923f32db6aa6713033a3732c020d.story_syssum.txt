LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Comic actor Harvey Korman has died at 81, according to the UCLA Medical Center.
"Tragically, after such a hard-fought battle, he passed away."
Angie Horejsi, an assistant to Burnett, told The Associated Press that Burnett was devastated by Korman's death: "She loved Harvey very much," Horejsi said.
Korman was born in Chicago, Illinois.
Korman landed some sketch work on "The Red Skelton Show" in 1961, followed by a four-year stint on "The Danny Kaye Show," which led to his joining Carol Burnett in 1967.
