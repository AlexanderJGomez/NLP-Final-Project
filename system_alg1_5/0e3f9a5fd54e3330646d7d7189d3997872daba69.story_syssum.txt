Rena was playing on her lounge floor, in her mother's lap, when the shot tore through her cheek.
We followed, unsure what had happened.
A sucking sound, coupled with a gargle.
Soon it became clear they thought she would live.
She was breathing more easily.
On the stairs up to the apartment was Rena's blood.
In the window was the small hole that the bullet had made.
The next morning, we returned.
Rena was dead.
At each, they failed.
A sniper's bullet had killed a four-year-old girl, leaving us wondering how the violence now engulfing Aleppo will ever end, whether its civilians will ever recover life as they knew it.
