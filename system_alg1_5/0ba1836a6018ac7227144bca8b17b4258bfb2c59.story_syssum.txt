(CNN) -- For the residents of Christchurch, New Zealand, time stopped at 12.51pm on February 22, 2011, when a massive earthquake ripped through the city, destroying homes, lives and businesses.
After being pulled out, 24 hours later, she told CNN, "I was finding it hard to breathe, and I really thought that was it for me.
For residents in the red zone, there is no future there.
"It was a tiny wee suburb and nearly every house there has gone," she said.
"It's a city of two parts really," said Matt O'Connell, the earthquake recovery coordinator for the Catholic Diocese, who works in the same office as Boyd.
"A lot of people are tired, stressed and frustrated.
The February 22 quake was one itself, after a larger, magnitude 7.1 quake the previous September.
There was further damage, no one was injured, but it was a psychological blow for many people," O'Connell said.
And 200 infrastructure repair projects are now underway, he said.
On the eve of the anniversary, the city buried the unidentified remains of four people who were killed in the quake in a new cemetery.
