"It's a great honor to be asked to be the next manager of Manchester United," Moyes told United's official website.
"I have had a terrific job at Everton, with a tremendous chairman and Board of Directors and a great set of players.
"When we discussed the candidates that we felt had the right attributes we unanimously agreed on David Moyes," Ferguson told the club's official website.
Moyes told Everton chairman Bill Kenwright of his desire to join Manchester United and succeed Ferguson on Wednesday.
"Everton can confirm that David Moyes will leave the Club at the end of the season," the Merseyside club said in a statement.
"Everton officials will start the search for a replacement manager immediately," added the Everton statement.
United did not have to pay Everton compensation for Moyes, as his contract had been due to expire in July.
Moyes later sued the player and his publisher over remarks made in his autobiography, but they settled out of court.
