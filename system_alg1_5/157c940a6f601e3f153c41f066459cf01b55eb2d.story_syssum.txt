A great white shark is tagged Saturday off Cape Cod, Massachusetts.
Chatham's beaches were closed to swimmers after the sightings, Skomal said.
Skomal identified a great white shark on Friday, and then the two were tagged Saturday.
Massachusetts has recorded only four shark attacks since 1670, two of which were fatal.
