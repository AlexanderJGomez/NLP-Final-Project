"Originally, American planned to evaluate the seats on eight Boeing 757 airplanes, but out of an abundance of caution, the decision was made to proactively evaluate a total of 47 Boeing 757 airplanes that have the same model Main Cabin seats with a common locking mechanism," company spokeswoman Andrea Huguely said in a statement.
Not all of the seats were loose, the company said, but they had the potential to become so.
American Airlines Flight 98, a Boeing 777-200 carrying 246 passengers and 14 crew members, was diverted as a precaution, airline spokesman Ian Bradley told CNN.
Niall Maloney, head of operations for Shannon Airport, said such technical diversions are not uncommon.
Late Tuesday, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association said it would resume contract negotiations with the airline.
Seat installation work is largely carried out by outside contractors, rather than maintenance personnel employed by the airline, he said in a statement.
