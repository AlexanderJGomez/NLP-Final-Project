Marriage is an institution intended for two people who love one another, who want to commit to lifetime bonding as mates, and to form a family, whether it's only the two of them, or also includes children.
Gay couples and their families have lived openly in our communities for more than 30 years, and we know them now as neighbors, family members and friends.
Four out of five young voters, of all faiths and political parties, support marriage equality, and even those who continue to oppose marriage rights for same-sex couples can see that it is inevitable.
The court found DOMA to be unconstitutional -- and it also allowed marriage rights for same-sex couples to return to California.
By striking down DOMA and dismissing the appeal on California's Proposition 8, the Supreme Court has forged a bipartisan consensus that marriage is an important enough institution that it should apply to humans equally, regardless of gender.
