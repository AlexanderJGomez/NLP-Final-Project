"To me art is a constant process.
I always want to improve my panoramic scenes," Asisi told CNN.
"But this panoramic scene is not really about showing a cityscape, it is more about the stories hidden within the city," Asisi said.
"It seems Asisi's artistically and archaeologically-underpinned reconstruction of an ancient cityscape fills a large audience with enthusiasm for panoramic scenes and classical antiquity even today," said Andreas Scholl, director of Berlin's antiquities collection.
Probably it is both: Art starts where science stops," he said.
"This panorama is fascinating," said Rene Gust, 32, from Berlin.
"To me it is extremely interesting why so many people in the former GDR did accept to live in such a country," he said.
"And there is much more to come," Asisi said.
