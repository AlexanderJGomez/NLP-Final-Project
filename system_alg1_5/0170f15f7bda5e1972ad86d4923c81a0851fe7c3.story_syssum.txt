(CNN) -- A fire erupted Friday at the headquarters of the Shanksville, Pennsylvania, memorial to United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed on September 11, 2001, officials said.
Four buildings were damaged, the park service said.
"I think stuff has been lost," Nacke said.
"At the temporary memorial, people would leave cards, T-shirts and handmade stuff that was very comforting to us," he said.
"We are deeply saddened to learn that a fire occurred at the Flight 93 National Memorial headquarters," Gordon Felt, president of Families of Flight 93 said in a statement.
The cause of the blaze is under investigation, he said.
The memorial, still incomplete, includes a visitor center with traditional and interactive exhibits, public programs and information about the history of Flight 93.
