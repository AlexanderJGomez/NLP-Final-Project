The 36-year-old from Atlanta, Georgia, said he tried to convert his analog TV to digital but was turned down for a government coupon.
"With the economy, I don't have enough cash to do cable, so I'm just really debating whether or not I really want to make that switch to digital," Richter said.
That giveaway didn't meet demand, though, and as of late January, more than 3.2 million people were on the program's waiting list.
"I live here by myself, so it will be a big deal for me," said Monica Lawson, a 42-year-old from rural Alto, Georgia.
"Basically I'm downgrading at this point," she said.
"With digital, you get a great picture or nothing," said Mark Wigfield, spokesperson for the Federal Communications Commission.
On the whole, studies show more people will get TV signals than will lose them in the switch to digital, Ingram said.
"I just watch the news all the time, that's all I want," he said.
"I get the weather, the news, what's going on -- all of it -- I want to know it."
If something's really, really bad, someone can call me," he said.
But if not, he said won't be angry at the government for the delays.
