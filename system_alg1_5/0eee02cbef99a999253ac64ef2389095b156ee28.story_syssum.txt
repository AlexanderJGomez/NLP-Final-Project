Four years ago, my son, now 16, was devastated when James took his talents to Miami.
My 13-year-old is a bit older, but would chat with and high-five James' son, LeBron Jr.
You see, my sons like James.
For those who hadn't noticed, things are indeed hot in Cleveland.

For Clevelanders, that was supposed to mean something.
Cleveland is standing proud and tall.
RNC and LeBron.
On Friday, LeBron James stood up for Cleveland, for Akron, for northeast Ohio.
Welcome home LeBron.
