Richter, testifying via video link from South Korea, said all the shooting ceased when Maj. Nidal Hasan was brought down by police fire.
"I remember saying to the police officer, 'He is one of us,'" Richter said.
Another 68 were collected outside, for a total of 214, they said.
"I challenged him, 'Halt, military police, drop your weapon,'" Todd said.
No," Munley said.
Munley said she exchanged fire with the gunman and was injured herself.
In the final moments, "I realized he was closing in," Munley said.
Listening to her testimony Wednesday, Hasan gave no reaction, occasionally looking down.
"It sounded like thousands of shots being fired," he said.
In the end, Hasan fell to the ground, and Todd ran up, kicked his gun away, turned him over on his stomach and searched him.
The investigating officer, Col. James Pohl, who acts as the presiding judge in the case, said he would receive the autopsy reports only to identify the victims and their cause of death.
The defense has been told it can take up its case November 8.
