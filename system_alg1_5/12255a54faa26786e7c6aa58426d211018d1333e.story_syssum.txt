Rebels fought hard in a back-and-forth war for Ajdabiya, the last stop before their stronghold, Benghazi, further to the east.
Attacks also were made on armored vehicles near Misrata and Ajdabiya, it said.
The South African government also said NATO has granted the committee permission to meet with Gadhafi in the Libyan capital, Tripoli.
As such, opposition leaders in Benghazi did not express optimism over the success of mediation.
Meanwhile, Libyan Foreign Minister Khaled Gaim condemned on state-run television the reopening of key ports in the eastern cities of Tobruk and Benghazi, which he said enables the rebels to resume an oil trade.
Street fighting erupted as the loyalists, aided by sympathizers, entered the city.
At the height of their march toward Tripoli, rebels came within 40 kilometers (25 miles) of Sirte -- Gadhafi's hometown in western Libya.
"The troops of Gadhafi have good weapons and have training and have leadership and have experience," one rebel fighter said.
