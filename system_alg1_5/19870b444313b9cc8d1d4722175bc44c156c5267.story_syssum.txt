His star power has soared, too.
One of Xi's most applauded moves since he became the Communist Party chief has been an intensified fight against corruption, a lightning rod for mass discontent across the country.
"Xi has made good on his word," said Han Deqiang, an economics professor at Beihang University in Beijing well known for his passionate advocacy of Maoism.
"Without systemic reform, new cases of corruption will pop up while old ones are being addressed," he said.
Cheered by nationalists, who have yearned for the return of Mao-era hardline stance against the Americans or Soviets, the ADIZ move is seen by some hawks as a sign of Xi's increasing strength and confidence.
"Abe's shrine visit has given Xi the perfect excuse to project his power both at home and abroad," said Hu Jia, one of China's most prominent human rights activists, who was imprisoned for more than three years for his advocacy.
Xi's fight against corruption and populist style have won him genuine admiration from a young, well-educated urban crowd.
"Chairman Mao is our founding father -- rejecting him means the rejection of the regime's legitimacy," said Professor Han, who has expressed disapproval of what happened to Bo, a big proponent of reviving Maoism.
Other than an ambiguous notion of fulfilling the great Chinese Dream, it seems that Xi hasn't given clear answers to these challenging questions.
