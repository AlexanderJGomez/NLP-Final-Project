Clinton won Kentucky by more than 30 points, but Obama's share of the state's 51 delegates was enough put him over the threshold, according to CNN estimates.
Speaking in Iowa, where he won the first-in-the-nation caucuses, Obama told supporters, "it was in this great state where we took the first steps of an unlikely journey to change America."
"This year's Republican primary was a contest to see which candidate could out-Bush the other, and that is the contest John McCain won," he said.
"Tonight we have achieved an important victory," she said in Louisville.
Among them, Clinton won 72-22 percent.
Two-thirds of Clinton's supporters there said they would vote Republican or not vote at all rather than for Obama, according to the polls.
Obama doesn't have enough delegates to capture the nomination outright; Clinton still has a chance, if a slight one, to win the nomination if enough of the roughly 800 superdelegates were to back her.
Obama's name wasn't on the Michigan ballot, and he received no votes in that state's contest.
If we had the same rules as the Republicans, I would be nominee right now," she said.
