Paul Walsh, boss of the world's largest spirits producer, told CNN: "We have to have less regulation and more focus on a competitive edge.
"Europe continues to become a smaller piece of the overall pie," said Walsh, who is focusing on faster growth markets, such as Latin America, Africa and Asia.
"We have to do a far better job in educating our population on the imperative of staying in Europe," said Walsh.
He added the company should "explain to them that many of these brands enjoy their place in the global marketplace because of free trade agreements that are configured via Europe."
