"Jones could split helmets with his head slap, and his outside speed rush was devastating," wrote Paul Zimmerman, aka Dr. Z, in Sports Illustrated.
Jones once said he wished that, after messing with him, opposing players would wake up "hopefully on Tuesday."
So effective, the NFL banned it.
It was Deacon Jones."
