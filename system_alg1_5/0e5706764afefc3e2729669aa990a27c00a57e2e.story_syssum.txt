They then questioned him on details of the probe into the bombing of the Argentine Jewish Mutual Association (AMIA) building in Buenos Aires on July 18, 1994, he said.
Lifschitz said his abductors tortured him while asking about the AMIA investigation.
"They told me that I wouldn't die unless they wanted me to," he said Sunday.
Lifschitz, who has also worked as a lawyer for Argentine Federal Police, is the former legal secretary for Judge Juan Jose Galeano, who headed the investigation into local connections to the AMIA bombing until he was removed from the case.
Tehran has repeatedly denied any involvement.
Lifschitz, who said he is a non-practicing Jew, also told CNN the men were interested in his religion.
"We trust Argentine authorities will quickly find those who carried out this brutal attack on Mr. Lifschitz," said David Harris, executive director of the American Jewish Committee.
Earlier this month, an Argentine court ordered the seizure of property owned by a former Iranian diplomat in Buenos Aires sought for his role in the 1994 AMIA attack.
