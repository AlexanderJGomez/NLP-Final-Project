ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- It's a common sight in the traffic-clogged streets of Istanbul, a city that straddles two continents.
"Istanbul is a dynamically changing city, every year increasing in population," says Zeynep Buket, an engineer working with Turkey's transportation ministry.
"We will connect two continents, Asia and Europe," said Nusret Ilbay, one of the many engineers working on the $3 billion Marmaray Tunnel Project.
"As you can see, some leakage on the wall face has been observed," Ilbay explained on a tour of the construction site.
Then, using divers and undersea cameras, they submerged and buried 11 massive pre-fabricated tunnel segments, almost all of them longer than a football field.
But, in their rush to modernize Istanbul's transport system, city planners ran into an unforeseen obstacle: history.
"This was a big moment of joy and happiness for us, an unexplainable feeling," recalls Professor Zeynep Kiziltan, the acting director of Istanbul's Archaeology Museum.
Since that discovery, armies of hundreds of laborers and archaeologists have been working in a giant pit, three shifts a day, seven days a week.
"Its mind-boggling ... it really looks like an Indiana Jones-type operation," says Pulak, who has worked as a consultant on the excavation of the lost port.
Scattered around the ship are shards of pottery, animal bones, and thousand-year-old clamshells.
"I think it is one of the unique projects not only for us but for the world," said geologist Yucel Yilmaz.
"The first man, about 8,400 years ago, came and started to settle here," Yilmaz said.
In the rush to move forward, the residents of Istanbul have accidentally uncovered a valuable piece of their city's ancient past.
