Kiev had stalled trucks on the Russian side of the border for days, before acknowledging Sunday that the convoy, in fact, had humanitarian aid.
ET) Friday, 227 Russian vehicles had crossed into Ukraine, according to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which has an observer mission at the checkpoint the convoy went through.
"We call this a direct invasion for the first time under cynical cover of the Red Cross," said Valentyn Nalyvaychenko, the head of Ukraine's security service.
"Further delay would have been unacceptable," a Kremlin statement said.
"It has nothing to do with humanitarianism."
The pair concurred, too, that the convoy "is a further provocation and a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty" and called for the stop "of Russian personnel, military equipment and armored vehicles into eastern Ukraine."
So, too, are the Russian troops massed at the border.
"They are definitely more overt, aggressive and out in the open," the official said.
Ukraine has time and again accused Russia of effectively fomenting rebellion by supporting rebels -- including militarily -- in eastern Ukraine, some of whom continue to hold territory there despite a push by Ukraine's military.
Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, insisted Friday that the current humanitarian convoy won't be one of them.
