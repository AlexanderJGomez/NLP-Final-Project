"Based on most of the potential exposure scenarios, the risk of infection is very low," the agency said in a statement.
Believing the samples were inactivated, workers in those labs did not don adequate protective equipment, the CDC said.
Sometime between then and June 6, procedures in two of the three labs may have aerosolized the spores, the CDC said.
"In the worst-case scenarios, literally, within a day or two of exposure, if you've inhaled spores and if they are very lethal, one begins to get -- as they say -- the standard flu symptoms -- high fever, malaise," said Leonard Cole, a bioterrorism expert.
The CDC said disciplinary action, as necessary, will be taken.
We will report findings of this investigation and all steps we take to improve lab-safety processes as a result of this incident," the agency's statement said.
