"I didn't realize how much my life would change, even in the last 10 days," McIlroy said on "Piers Morgan Tonight," aired Thursday.
"To me, I won a golf tournament and that was the end of it," McIlroy said.
His father, Gerry, held down three jobs and was a "calming influence" during the U.S. Open, said McIlroy, an only child.
"If you do that, you give them an advantage from the start."
After all, there are more tournaments to win.
I believe in myself," McIlroy said.
