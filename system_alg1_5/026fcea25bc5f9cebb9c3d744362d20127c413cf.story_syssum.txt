Peggy Shannon, 67, who works at the Senior Citizens Service Desk in San Diego City Hall, allegedly faced "continuous inappropriate sexual advances by the mayor while trying to do her job," according to the office of her attorney, Gloria Allred.
Later, Shannon spoke to CNN's "Piers Morgan Live," and called for the mayor's resignation.
Filner, 70, was elected mayor of the eighth-largest American city in 2012, after 10 terms in Congress.
The San Diego's City Attorney's Office told CNN Thursday that it had found the charges were inappropriate.
The city attorney's office said a rarely used section of the city charter, Section 108, dating back to 1931, would allow for Filner to be removed from office -- without a recall -- over unauthorized payments from the city treasury.
The mayor's city credit card was stopped in July, Faulconer's office said.
