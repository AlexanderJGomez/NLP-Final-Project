"I put her bags in the back, and I said, 'You get over here.'
And I said, 'I love you,'" Lane recalled.
"This town and this world is just going to be so different without them," said Lane.
"Sierra was so kind to everybody, and she looked at the positive in everything," she told CNN.
"We're helping each other out and leaning on each other," Lane said.
The other family members who died in the plane crash were Sierra's uncle and aunt, Marty and Kimberly Gutzler, and Piper, their 9-year-old daughter.
Marty Gutzler, 48, owned a furniture store in Nashville and loved flying, boating and spending time with his family, his obituary said.
Kimberly Gutzler, 46, "loved her animals, traveling, painting and spending time with her family," according to her obituary.
"Everyone's opening their arms and sending well wishes," she said.
