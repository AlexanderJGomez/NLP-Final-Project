While Holder recently reiterated his "nation of cowards" statement, he and Obama have tried to focus attention on root causes of racial division in the aftermath of Brown's killing, which has sparked more than a week of unrest on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, chronicled by widespread media coverage.
"I wanted the people of Ferguson to know that I personally understood that mistrust," Holder said.
"And, you know, part of my job -- that I can do, I think, without any potential conflicts -- is to get at those root causes."
"Any time a situation like this occurs, he becomes more of a more centrist, emotionally," Granderson said Wednesday.
"At the time that he stopped me, I was a federal prosecutor," Holder said.
A decade younger than Holder, Obama has taken a present-day approach to personalizing his experience as black in America.
