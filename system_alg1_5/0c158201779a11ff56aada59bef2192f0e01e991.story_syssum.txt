Avasthi, now a doctor, has a wife, child and his very own German shepherd mix.
As a doctor who specializes in child and adolescent psychiatry, he has seen kids transform in the presence of pets.
"Kids naturally do things that upset cats and dogs â€” hugging, staring, petting on the head," says animal behaviorist Kristen Collins of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA.org).
Avasthi says.
Reinforce healthy interaction: Help kids understand how to safely approach a cat or dog.
"It's best if you let the pet come to you," Collins says.
Therapy may begin with kids seeing photos of puppies, then pint-sized pups and, eventually, larger dogs.
"Then the child is not afraid and doesn't learn the wrong behaviors," Avasthi says.
These activities help kids learn positive interaction, and dogs learn that kids are great treat dispensers, she says.
