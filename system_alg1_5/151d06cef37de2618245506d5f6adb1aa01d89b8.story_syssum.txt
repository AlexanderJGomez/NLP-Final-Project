The U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami, Florida, declined to comment.
None of the victims' bodies has been found, and authorities have said it is unlikely they will be.
This spring, Zarabozo said in court documents that Archer killed the crew, using Zarabozo's gun.
"They said he was going to plead guilty," he said of Archer.
Archer, 36, was once an Army MP who served at the U.S.
Archer befriended Zarabozo, 20, who left Cuba with his family.
He maintains his not guilty plea, and he plans to proceed to trial."
