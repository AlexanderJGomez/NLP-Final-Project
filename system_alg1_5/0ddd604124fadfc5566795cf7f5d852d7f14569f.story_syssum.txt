(CNN) -- George Zimmerman, who sold his first painting on eBay for a whopping $100,000, is at it again.
Zimmerman's brother, Robert, posted a photo of the painting on Twitter on Wednesday night.
I found a creative, way to express myself, my emotions and the symbols that represent my experiences," the item description for that painting read.
Previously, he was stopped several times for speeding.
