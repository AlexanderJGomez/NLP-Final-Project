This year's co-hosts Equatorial Guinea and Gabon are the smallest nations ever to hold the event -- which is also known as AFCON -- giving rise to concerns about security, as well as travel and tourism infrastructure.
The first time was 40 years ago in my country, Cameroon," CAF spokesman Habuba Suleiman told CNN.
"Each of the co-hosts could perhaps not afford to host a competition of 16 teams alone.
"When you award AFCON to places like Burkina Faso, Mali, Angola or Gabon, you find that coffers for sporting infrastructure that would be normally be difficult to open suddenly emerge and you're leaving a legacy of football infrastructure," he told CNN.
"The tournament has a unique, chaotic charm, maybe that has an appeal," he said.
We are a group of peaceful people who are convinced that football has to be a factor of unity, friendship and fraternity," he told CNN.
"Finally hosting the tournament means so many opportunities for Gabon and its people," he said.
"I have never heard of problems without solutions," Suleiman said.
"In Africa, small problems always end up being arranged.
AFCON is the planet's third biggest football tournament, behind the World Cup and the European Championships.
The final will be held in Gabon's capital, Libreville, on February 12.
The qualified nations are: Group A -- Equatorial Guinea, Libya, Zambia, Senegal; Group B -- Ivory Coast, Sudan, Burkina Faso, Angola; Group C -- Gabon, Niger, Morocco, Tunisia; Group D -- Ghana, Botswana, Mali, Guinea.
