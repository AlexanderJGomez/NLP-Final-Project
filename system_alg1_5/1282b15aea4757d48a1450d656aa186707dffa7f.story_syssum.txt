Whether Sotloff lives or dies, the executioner said on the video, depends on what Obama does next.
ISIS is believed to be holding a number of Americans, including Sotloff, a U.S. official told CNN.
If ISIS, also known as ISIL, hoped the execution video and threat would ease U.S. military involvement in Iraq, it failed.
ISIS militants, who are Sunni Muslim extremists, have carried out brutal attacks on towns and villages as they've advanced across Iraq, targeting Iraq's Christians, minority sects such as the Yazidis, centered in the northern Sinjar area, and Shia Muslims.
"It's the largest single aid push we have mounted in more than a decade," the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Antonio Guterres, said.
Now that the dam is cleared of ISIS militants, Iraqi forces are moving to grow their area of control, the Defense Department said.
If approved, the troops would number less than 300, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
