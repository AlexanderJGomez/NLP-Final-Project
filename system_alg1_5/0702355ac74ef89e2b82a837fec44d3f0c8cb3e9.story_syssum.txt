Meanwhile, more than 20 bush fires continued to burn uncontrolled across the state despite the easing weather conditions, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
Firefighters were battling 98 fires across New South Wales as of late Thursday, according to the state's Rural Fire Service.
"This difficult, damaging and dangerous day and these conditions are not going to be over quickly," he said.
They include the State Mine Fire, a large bush fire moving from Lithgow toward Bilpin, in the Blue Mountains, which has burned more than 20,000 hectares (more than 49,000 acres) of bushland, firefighters said.
