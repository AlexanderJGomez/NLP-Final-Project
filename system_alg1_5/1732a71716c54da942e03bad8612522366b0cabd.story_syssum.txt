The wife of British hostage Alan Henning pleaded Saturday with ISIS to release him, describing her husband as a "peaceful, selfless man" who was only in Syria to help people in need.
Henning's wife said her husband, a father of two, was only trying to do good in Syria.
"I have sent some really important messages but they have not been responded to," she said.
"I pray that the people holding Alan respond to my messages and contact me before it is too late," she said.
"When they hear this message, I implore the people of the Islamic State to see it in their hearts to release my husband, Alan Henning."
"It's all worthwhile when you see what is needed actually gets where it needs to go," he said, before hugging a colleague.
"As your sister in Islam, I would implore you and beg of you: please spare the life of this innocent man," she said.
CAGE, a Muslim-led human rights advocacy group in London, also called for Henning's immediate release, saying he wasn't involved in any hostilities toward Muslims.
"He really is the guy that fixes everything," she told CNN.
