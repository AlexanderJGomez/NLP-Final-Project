Pakistan's military has denied the allegation, saying there is "no truth to the report."
Abbas "expressed his astonishment at the far-fetched reporting of certain foreign media outlets," the statement said.
The New York Times reported that "Pakistan's intelligence service probably allowed Chinese military engineers to examine the wreckage," citing "American officials and others familiar with the classified intelligence assessments."
"They've taken some steps that have given us reason to pause on some of the aid which we're giving to the military, and we're trying to work through that," White House Chief of Staff William Daley said at the time.
