Six people were injured in Saturday's attack, the fourth suspected U.S. strike on Pakistani soil in November.
Elsewhere, three people were killed and 11 were injured in an explosion inside a mosque in northwest Pakistan's tribal region, a government official said.
Police were investigating the explosion, which was detonated using a homemade timer, Khan said.
This week, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry summoned U.S.
However, Pakistan's government has repeatedly complained about the strikes.
At the time, a missile strike from a suspected U.S. drone on a compound in South Waziristan killed 20 people.
