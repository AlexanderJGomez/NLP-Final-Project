Washington (CNN)Republicans poised to take control of Congress are already threatening to kill what could turn out to be President Barack Obama's most significant second-term achievement: a nuclear deal with Iran.
Instead, the President would temporarily "suspend" them.
But others, including some Democrats, worry that Obama is being hoodwinked by Iran.
If he refuses, or if lawmakers vote to show their disapproval of the deal, funding for its implementation would be cutoff.
They contend that a bad deal is now more likely because the administration has been too eager to make concessions to Iran.
Obama would be sure veto any legislation that could threaten the agreement.
"There will definitely be a fight.
Dylan Williams, director of government affairs for J Street, a left-leaning pro-Israel group said new sanctions would "guarantee" a fracturing of the international coalition against Iran.
"At the end of the day, the president needs to lift sanctions through Congress in order to make a deal possible."
The White House has already shown it is ready to play political hardball over Iran, warning last year that anyone who opposes the deal is effectively backing a march to war with Iran.
Period.
Incoming Republican Senate Foreign Relations committee chairman Bob Corker will be a vital player, as he has voiced skepticism of the president's Iran diplomacy in the past, while being more pragmatic than other Obama critics on sanctions.
