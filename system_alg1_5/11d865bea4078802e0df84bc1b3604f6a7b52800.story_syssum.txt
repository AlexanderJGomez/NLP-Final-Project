(CNN) -- The father of Malala Yousafzai, the teenager whom the Taliban tried to kill, has been given a job in a Pakistan consulate in Birmingham, England, where she is recovering from gunshot wounds to her head and neck, Pakistani officials said Wednesday.
On October 9, Malala was on a school van in Swat Valley when Taliban gunmen stopped the vehicle and demanded that other girls tell them who was Malala.
Malala was then shot, as were two other girls who survived the attack.
Since her shooting, Malala has become an international figure.
Malala is walking, writing and reading again.
Last month, Malala asked a graduate school not to name its institution after her.
But she wished for people to continue to fight for girls to go to school, he said.
