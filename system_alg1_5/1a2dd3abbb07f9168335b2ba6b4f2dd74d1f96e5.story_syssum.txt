Craig Murray, former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, has gained notoriety as one of the few diplomats to ignore the wishes of his government and openly criticize the country in which he was stationed.
Two cases of torture that were brought to his attention propelled Murray to speak out.
"I sent the photos on to the pathology department of the University of Glasgow," explains Murray.
Murray's claims are corroborated by respected NGOs.
Murray was recalled to London for a reprimand.
In a statement the FCO told CNN: "The FCO's handling of this case has been scrupulously fair throughout, and entirely in accordance with its obligations as an employer, including its duty of care.
Mr. Murray then opted to apply for early severance under the terms of the FCO scheme to reduce its staff numbers, and we accepted that application."
In Uzbekistan, his concerns appear to have become reality.
The US ceased its effective alliance with Uzbekistan in 2005, nominally due to a massacre in May in Andijan where several hundred civilians were shot dead at a protest, but in reality, claims Murray, because Karimov had switched allegiances and formed a military partnership with Russia.
