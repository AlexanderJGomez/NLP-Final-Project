Police in France seized 12 people for suspected terrorist ties Tuesday, but it is not clear whether they are connected to the plot that prompted the warning.
The nine other arrests happened throughout southern France, including some in Marseilles and at least one in Avignon, police said.
The man was arrested last month by Italian police in Naples, Italy, on a European arrest warrant requested by France, the chief prosecutor in Naples told CNN Monday.
Three others were foreigners whose nationalities were not disclosed, said the officials, who did not want to be named.
The bodies were removed by the Taliban, one of the officials said.
Jihadists from the German city of Hamburg are alleged to be at the heart of the suspected plots, European intelligence officials said.
Sidiqi's father, Mohammed Naim Sidiqi, said his son was on his way to the German embassy in the Afghan capital to get a new passport when he was detained.
Sidiqi's sister says she, too, is shocked by the reports.
Before setting off, Sidiqi told his family he was going to meet some friends in Pakistan and then go across from there to Afghanistan, according to his sister.
