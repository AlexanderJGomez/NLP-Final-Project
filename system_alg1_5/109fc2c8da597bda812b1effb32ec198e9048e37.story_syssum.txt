The operation, dubbed "Dark Waters" and carried out in collaboration with the FBI, resulted in the arrests in Madrid of four members of the cartel, which is run by Joaquin Guzman Loera, also known as "El Chapo," police said in a statement.
"Thanks to the exchange of information with the FBI, one knew that the suspects planned to initiate important shipments of cocaine by ship, hidden in containers with legal, declared cargo," it said.
A few days later, he was joined by Jesus Gutierrez Guzman, a cousin of "El Chapo" and considered the leader of the group; Samuel Zazueta Valenzuela, a principal collaborator, and Rafael Humberto Celaya Valenzuela, who was overseeing the organization's "legal" affairs, it said.
The four men, aged 37 to 52, were arrested near their hotels in Madrid, it said.
"As the drug wars come under fire from many quarters, one of the big advances that has been made has been intelligence sharing between U.S. agencies and their foreign counterparts, and this is further proof of that."
