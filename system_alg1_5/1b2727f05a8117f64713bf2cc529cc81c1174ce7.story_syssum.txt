Engineering, he believed, wasn't being used to contribute to NASA's future.
" 'You never talk bad about NASA, Dad,' " Altemus recalled his son saying.
"I said, 'What if we unleashed the power of engineering, and did things our way, and were not deterred?

Thankfully there were no injuries, but the crash "was a huge setback for the team," Altemus said.
In fact, during the next decade, NASA plans an unprecedented mission to send astronauts to an asteroid.
They practiced on a mockup of an Orion, NASA's manned spacecraft which is still being developed.
The fuel-making spacecraft would then harvest methane from the atmosphere, said Altemus.
"It's as simple as that.
