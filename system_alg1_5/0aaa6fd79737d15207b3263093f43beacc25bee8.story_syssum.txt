There was a giant crash, and a large, heavy beam dropped on the front of her car, crushing the engine, barely missing her face.
"Jack, earthquake hit while I was under concrete, worst happened," she wrote.
Then, Frediani was able to nudge the crushed dashboard just enough.
That was October 17, 1989.
The fault line, known as the Cascadia Subduction Zone, could one day cause an even larger quake.
Oregon is not prepared for a megaquake, and few areas are, Madin says.
It is these factors that led the Oregon Resilience Plan to conclude that in a worst-case scenario, 10,000 people could be killed, and large areas of Oregon could be without transportation, electricity, water and sewer for several months to several years.
Using historic data, scientists like Dr. Chris Goldfinger, a marine geologist and professor at Oregon State University, can forecast the probability of another great quake.
On the other hand, the north end, with the great population centers, sees a big event closer to every 500 years.
We also need to strengthen or replace critical facilities like hospitals, fire and police facilities and schools," says Madin.
