Cuomo called for a "societal deep breath" and a "cooling off period" this week in a radio interview Monday on New York's WNYC, calling the heated, inflammatory rhetoric that engulfed the city this weekend unproductive.
It's not productive, it's potentially destructive," Cuomo said.
When asked if de Blasio had the governor's full support, Cuomo said the mayor, union leaders and community activists have his "full support."
Cuomo also said the grand jury decision in Garner's chokehold death at the hands of a police officers "was seemingly wholly incongruous with what you saw in that video."
Cuomo added that "there are legitimate points" in Garner's case.
