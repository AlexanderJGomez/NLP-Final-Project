Syria has admitted its shelling killed Turkish civilians, has apologized, and has promised that the incident will not be repeated, Turkey's deputy prime minister says.
According to surveys, public opinion in Turkey is strongly against all-out war with Syria.
The Syrian conflict has also been internationalized along Cold War lines, with the US and Russia backing rival camps.
The spillover of the Syrian war has reached not just Turkey but also Jordan, Lebanon, and Iraq, with frequent armed clashes and casualties.
Despite assurances given by the Syrian government that the shelling that killed the Turkish civilians won't be repeated, it is doubtful whether that pledge can be honored as Syria descends into all-out war.
They have made it very clear they will not act on their own against Syria.
