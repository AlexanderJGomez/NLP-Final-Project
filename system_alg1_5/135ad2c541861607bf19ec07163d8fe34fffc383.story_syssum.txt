And those who didn't follow party rules came under scrutiny, had their choices of a career and a life limited, and sooner or later became a case for the Stasi, the secret police of East Germany.
It was the Stasi, the "shield and sword" of the Communist party, that was charged with ensuring the power of the party.

When finally people gathered the courage to stand up against the repression of the Communist party, one of the accomplishments of the Peaceful Revolution of 1989 was the opening of the Stasi archive.

It has created never before imagined opportunities for businesses, for personal connectivity, for politics, and for intelligence gathering.
