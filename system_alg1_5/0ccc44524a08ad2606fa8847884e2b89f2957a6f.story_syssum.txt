A new Pew Research Center study shows that millennial women are entering the workplace at near wage parity, with the narrowest pay gap on record.
But until women are paid the same as men, we will never be truly equal.
Millennial women can get involved by letting their representatives know they want legislation that addresses wage parity for men and women.
That's notable and promising, since many women my age have been fed the myth that the feminist movement achieved its goals and sexism no longer exists.
But I worry that we, as young women, while understanding sexism to be a systemic problem, still think of it as something we have to fix individually -- and therefore, we don't want to see ourselves as victims of it.
Instead, it's about changing the system from the ground up so that all women have that opportunity.
As a member of that group, I'd argue that we have a realistic view.
