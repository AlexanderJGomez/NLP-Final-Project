Marshals in Texas said Monday.
In August 2013, Stoeser was transferred to the Austin Transitional Center, a halfway house in Texas.
Authorities said Monday it's unclear when he died, or how.
No other remains have been found, they said.
He died in a shootout in New York City as police closed in on him.
