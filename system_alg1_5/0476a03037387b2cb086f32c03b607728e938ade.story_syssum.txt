The commission has summoned Yingluck, whose government is already under pressure from months-long protests in Bangkok, to appear February 27 to be notified of the charges.
Yingluck insists that the rice subsidy program, introduced in 2011, has been successful and benefited farmers.
Problems with the subsidy program have angered many farmers, normally an important component of Yingluck's support base.
The farmers said their planned protest wasn't political -- unlike the anti-government demonstrators in central Bangkok, they say they don't want to see the ouster of Yingluck.
Earlier this week, police tried to clear demonstrators out some protest sites.
Political opponents say Yingluck, who convincingly won elections in 2011, is simply Thaksin's puppet, an allegation she has repeatedly denied.
