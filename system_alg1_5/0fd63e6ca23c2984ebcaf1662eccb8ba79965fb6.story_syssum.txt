Bill Acree, director of team travel for baseball outfit the Atlanta Braves, says his team spends nearly a third of the year on the road, so they look for comfort.
For the hotels that do play host to traveling sports clubs, although those teams might only comprise a relatively small percentage of a hotel's trade, their reliability makes them an important part of their business.
Mike Jorgensen, general manager of the Westin Copley Place, said about half of the baseball teams that come to town to play the Red Sox stay at his hotel.
"We have a private back entrance and no other hotel guests know about this," she said.
"Football teams want to make sure we have on every floor Gatorade, Powerade, fruit," he said.
Moniz and Jorgensen agree that hockey players are the most hassle-free guests.
