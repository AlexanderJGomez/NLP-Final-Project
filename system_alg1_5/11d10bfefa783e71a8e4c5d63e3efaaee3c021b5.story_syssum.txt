After 14 long years in the dustbins of Congress, mainly due to strong opposition from the Catholic Church, the Reproductive Health (RH) Bill was approved by both the Senate and the House of Representatives on Monday, 17 December 2012.
The poor are miserable because, among other reasons, they have so many children.
But not only do the women suffer, the children do, too.
The bill, at the simplest level, wants to give an indigent married woman the freedom of informed choice concerning her reproductive rights.
Other nations include Spain, Portugal, Paraguay, Mexico, Guatemala, Ecuador, Colombia and Argentina.
In 2003, they issued a fatwah or religious ruling called "Call to Greatness."
The Filipino people, regardless of religion, are in favor of RH.
Reproductive health care is a human right.
