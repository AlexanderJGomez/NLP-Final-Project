About 10 minutes after launch, a cheer went up in the company's flight control room in Dulles, Virginia, outside Washington, when the craft separated from the second stage of the booster.
Unlike the SpaceX Dragon capsule, which is designed to be reused and eventually carry passengers, the can-shaped, 17-foot Cygnus is a one-shot craft that will burn up on re-entry after its flight to the space station.
"We look forward to the rendezvous with the station on Sunday, and with that we'll have Orbital joining SpaceX as one of our providers," NASA Associate Administrator Robert Lightfoot said.
SpaceX has so far made two of its 12 scheduled flights to the ISS under a $1.6 billion contract.
