In California, 13-year-old Jahi McMath's body is also being maintained with technology.
With Munoz, there are two lives at stake: hers and that of her unborn child.
For others, the mother and fetus are viewed as separate beings with independent interests.
Does the fetus become a ward of the state and the woman's body merely a biologic incubator for the fetus?
Another ethical aspect of this tragic case is the impact on Munoz's medical personnel, who are providing treatments that are not desired by the patient or her surrogate, and who are perceived to sustain death rather than life.
Their mandate is: First, do no harm.
They become cynical, detached or numb.
There are no easy answers.
We must engage with our communities about the boundaries of using technology, and what the appropriate interventions are when a person's life is sustained with technology.
However, as in the case of Marlise Munoz, we must consider whether keeping her alive by invoking a state law honors her and her memory.
