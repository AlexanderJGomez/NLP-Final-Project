But what you won't see in the movie are the events of August 9, 1995, six weeks after an FBI raid blew the case into public attention.
"There was nothing comical in the reality of the story," said Whitacre, who eventually spent nearly nine years in prison for his role in the price-fixing scheme and revelations he siphoned off $9 million from the company while he was working for the FBI.
"He didn't want to talk to a 52-year-old Mark Whitacre while preparing for the role, the Mark Whitacre who went to prison, who has been treated for bipolar disorder, who is now COO of a company," said Whitacre, who is now an executive for a small food supplement maker.
"As a result of this case, the Department of Justice and the FBI started looking around to see if they could find any other cases like this," said Dean Paisley, a retired FBI agent who supervised the undercover ADM work.
"The movie should be taken very, very seriously," said Sam Antar, a CPA who turned government witness against his employer in the 1980's.
"What happened in 'The Informant,' is he had an agenda to become head honcho of the company," Antar said.
"There were no provisions for similar checks and balances with Whitacre," Paisley said.
"He really screwed up by stealing," Paisley said.
