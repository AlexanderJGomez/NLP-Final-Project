Albertus Buitenhuis, 50, as described by his wife, has "always been on the larger side."
They settled in the city of Christchurch and Buitenhuis found work at a restaurant, the Cashmere Club, where he became known for his "curry of the day."
After the exams, the immigration authorities found that "he did not have an acceptable standard of health."
It also listed his "significant risk of obesity complications" as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, obstructive sleep apnea, some cancers and premature joint diseases.
"All countries do that."
Now 75 pounds lighter, Buitenhuis said he was never warned about not meeting an "acceptable standard of health" until about a year ago.
We're living with my sister," he said.
"It hurts your pride, it's humiliating."
"I think governments are looking for ways to reduce the health care cost burden on the population on the taxpayer," he told CNN.
There are no winners, I'm afraid."
"There's always been a restriction on immigration based on health issues, so the basic principle has always been, if you've got a major health problem that's a drain on the state, that counts against you in immigration," Jim Mann, professor of medicine and nutrition at University of Otago in New Zealand, told CNN.
It's a true fact," Mann added.
