But in fact, the insanity defense is raised in less than 1% of felony cases, and it's only successful in a fraction of those.
While it may seem strange to have patchwork law among the states on an apparent issue of science, according to the U.S. Supreme Court, that's exactly how it was intended to be.
Henceforth, the M'Naghten rule says that a person is insane if, because of a "disease of the mind" at the time he committed the act, he (1) did not know the "nature and quality of the act" that he was performing; or (2) he did not know that what he was doing was wrong.
The Durham rule was also criticized as vague and overly broad; many states rejected the test, and in 1962, the American Law Institute, or ALI, announced yet another insanity defense, which enjoyed immediate popularity with many legislatures and judiciaries.
In fact, its death knell sounded in 1981, when John Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity, based on an ALI standard, of the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan.
Some states don't even have the insanity defense.
It may seem strange that a medical-sounding determination like insanity has different definitions from state to state.
As Justice Louis Brandeis said in New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann,  "It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory, and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country."
Not only are the states free to develop disparate law in the field of legal insanity, but under the Constitution, they are encouraged to do so.
To many, particularly in the defense bar, the availability of the defense is often academic.
