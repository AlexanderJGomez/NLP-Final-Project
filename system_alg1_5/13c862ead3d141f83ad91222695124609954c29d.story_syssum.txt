I've been here 10 days now, and spent last weekend on call at ELWA Hospital, the 55-bed facility that SIM runs just outside Monrovia, Liberia's capital city.
But for the most part, ELWA Hospital is up and running, and most beds are full.
We talk with these patients privately, off the busy ward; then, along with the hospital's chaplain, we pray for them if they wish.
Friday, we had a 5-month-old infant arrive from Buchanan, about a three-hour drive down the coast, in very critical condition with pneumonia, sepsis and a distended abdomen.
We might not have been able to help her if she had come to a hospital sooner, because of the type of cancer she had, but if she had known her condition, her end of life journey might have been different.
That was a relief, and was unlike August, when delays in getting to the hospital caused most of our deliveries and C-sections to be stillbirths.
By the time I got there, despite IV fluids and oxygen, we had lost her.
All through Monday, my heart was heavy from the losses of the weekend.
