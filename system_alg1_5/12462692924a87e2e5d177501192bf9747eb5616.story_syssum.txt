Charles Rankin, Hernandez's attorney, did not object but asked the court to reconsider the matter.
Hernandez, 24, has pleaded not guilty to a charge of first-degree murder in the June shooting of his friend Lloyd, 27, a Boston-area semipro football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez's girlfriend.
That witness, Alexander Bradley, has filed a civil lawsuit accusing Hernandez of shooting him in the face during an argument after they left a Florida strip club in February.
Attorneys for the Patriots and the Lloyd family did not return CNN's calls.
