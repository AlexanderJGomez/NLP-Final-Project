In the same poll, marriage and parenthood remain important life goals for all young adults, with 86% of women and 82% of men listing marriage as "very important" or "one of the most important things" in life.
Moreover, while young women see marriage as desirable, they do not believe it is essential to their own happiness or to becoming a parent.
Focusing on self-development at the workplace does not, however, mean jettisoning hopes for a rich family life.
With the uncertainties of the new economy, where few jobs offer lifetime security, men's scaled back aspirations are as understandable as women's rising goals.
But as long as careers require unfettered, constant devotion and caretaking remains undervalued, privatized and penalized, the goal of striking their desired balance between paid work and the rest of life will remain illusive for young women and men alike.
It is past time to finish the gender revolution that began with women's march into the workplace.
