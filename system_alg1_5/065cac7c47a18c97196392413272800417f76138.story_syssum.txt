Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- During the summer of 2009, Egyptians from all walks of life waited in hopeful anticipation for the arrival of newly-elected U.S. President Barack Obama in Cairo.
Deposed President Hosni Mubarak's National Democratic Party building is still standing, but it has been burnt from the inside out.
Cairo, like many major cities in the world, has historically observed the U.S. presidential election closely and with a great deal of skepticism.
In the bars and cafes along the crowded, traffic-choked streets of downtown Cairo, people are too busy making the news to watch it unfold on television.
In 2008, Cairo closely watched as America neared the election of the first African-American president, the candidate of hope and change.
And recent events have convinced some that the Obama administration is not so keen on fulfilling its promises to supporting freedom, democracy, and civil liberties.
In the past, many Egyptians sought out hope and salvation in the actions of foreign governments -- but this electoral season, after a year of real change in Egypt, many Egyptians learned that hope will have to come, or at least start, from within.
