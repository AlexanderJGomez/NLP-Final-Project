Without the bread that she begs from strangers, she, her sisters, her baby brothers and her mom would all go hungry.
Every day, she heads far from her home, trekking up and down steep hills to the wealthier parts of the Afghan capital, where she can but hope richer people will take pity on her.
"Sir, do you have some bread?"
"A few days ago, some girls were kidnapped around here, and many people have gone missing.
She prays every day: "I say, 'God, take me out of this poverty and have my father go work so I can go to school.'
She dreams of being a teacher, and for three hours a day, she gets to be a little girl with big dreams.
Inside, Banafsha and the other children get to laugh.
At home, the work continues.
Finally, she will sleep.
