Ghetto Radio presenters Mbusii, Solloo and Essie have been locked inside a "glass house" in central Nairobi since Wednesday, as part of the station's annual Serious Request Kenya event.
"This country cannot afford to go back to that time," says Solloo from the glass house, a few moments before going on air.
"The response has just been amazing," says the DJ, who is relying on water and juices to get through the six-day period.
In that vote, both Mwai Kibaki, the incumbent, and challenger Raila Odinga claimed to have won.
"I just want everyone to understand that we need peace," he says.
