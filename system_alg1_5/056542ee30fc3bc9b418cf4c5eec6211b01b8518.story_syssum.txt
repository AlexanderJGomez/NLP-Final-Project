About 1:35 a.m. Thursday, a man ran up to a Tea Party Express bus, approaching from the left, waving his arms and shouting something that none of us on the bus could understand.
As he rushed us, shouting all the way, the bus driver cautiously slid open his window.
No one on the bus, including me, could understand what point the man was trying to make.
Ray March, one of the drivers, told me that a semi-truck driver tried to run his bus off the road.
As for creature comforts, space was a commodity.
One guy slept on the floor next to one of them, in the middle of the narrow walkway that attached the front of the bus to the back.
Still, despite the long trip, tempers never flared and pleasant conversation was not hard to find.
In the front of the bus, Casey was lounging comfortably.
At one point, as I was interviewing Williams, he mentioned Casey, put a laptop in front of her, and said she likes to blog from the bus.
