There are fewer than 240 known copies of the First Folio -- the first printed collection of 36 of William Shakespeare's plays, produced in 1623, seven years after his death -- so turning up a new one is an unlikely event.
"I am not an expert myself on Shakespeare's pieces, so I wanted to have the opinion of an expert," said Cordonnier.
Rasmussen's authentication, just this past weekend, confirmed what Cordonnier had suspected.
According to the British Library, which holds four copies, the First Folio was produced by two of Shakespeare's fellow actors and closest friends, John Heminge and Henry Condell.
The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, with 82 First Folios, has the single largest collection of the books, representing one-third of the world's existing copies.
