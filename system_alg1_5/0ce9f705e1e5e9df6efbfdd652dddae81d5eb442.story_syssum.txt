Yet for all her myriad accomplishments, Williams says one of her "biggest ... and proudest moments" came Friday night -- in the second round of a tournament in Indian Wells, California.
It's not who she was playing, but where.
On Friday, Williams was back.
"And I feel like that's when I felt it was the right thing," she said of her welcome.
According to him, one man said, "I wish it was '75, we'd skin you alive."
But she didn't celebrate.
Her father and sister, Venus, still stayed away.
The match itself wasn't easy, either.
Still, for all her competitive fire, Williams isn't feeling much pressure to win.
And it's a wonderful feeling."
