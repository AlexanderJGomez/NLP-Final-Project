Slowly, however, media reports are raising more uncomfortable questions about Heywood's death.
Now, the British government is asking China to investigate Heywood's death.

Bo Xilai is what is known as a "princeling," the son of a Maoist-era revolutionary hero.
Migrant workers flocked to Chongqing seeking, and often finding, a better life.
Just last month, however, Bo's career started to unravel.

Bo, the man who ran the criminals out of town, now finds himself ousted.
And Heywood, found dead in a Chongqing hotel room, may still yet have a tale to tell.
