After dating for more than two years, Ferguson and his boyfriend, Justin Mikita, decided to take the next step.
During a recent trip to Mexico, Ferguson "popped the big Q."
CNN: It definitely gets your attention.
But, in the context of our foundation, it felt like (it was) the right time to tell people.
I love calling Justin "the lover I've taken on," but he doesn't care for that.
Ferguson: I have such mixed feelings about it.
It's incredibly hard to swallow.
Ferguson: We're in a great place.
We just want to add to who has the right.
It was Justin's idea to incorporate it into the foundation.
Also, it matches your character in "Modern Family."
Ferguson: I mean it really is.
We're kind of on this roller coaster together, and it's a very bonding experience.
Ferguson: There's obviously some sense of protection because we know being (in) the media's eye how vulnerable that can be when you're going through something.
CNN: I can only imagine what a "Modern Family" gay wedding will be like.
We're in the process of planning it.
Ferguson: Well, we're not going to be redefining the marriage ceremony.
It's going to be a very nontraditional, very organic, very simple ceremony.
And we both do.
But, yeah, we both really want kids very much.
