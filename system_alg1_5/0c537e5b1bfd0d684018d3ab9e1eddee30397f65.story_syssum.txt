Former Toro Rosso driver Vettel needs to earn a 10th-place finish, or higher, in one of the season's five remaining grands prix to complete his triumph.
"Obviously there's still a chance for Jenson to win the title and for me not to win the title," Vettel told Formula One's official website.
I think it would be wrong to think like that at this stage, the target going into this weekend is not to get one point, in a way it's not to win the championship, the target is to do our best.
"Going into the last race and being some points behind is a completely different situation to leading the standings by a gap of 124 points," said Vettel, who was 15 points adrift of first-place Alonso heading into November's final race in the gulf kingdom.
"On paper, I think it's a circuit that will suit the Red Bulls, particularly in the high-speed sweeps that make up the first sector of the track, but I certainly don't think people should under-estimate our package.
If Vettel fails to clinch the championship this weekend, the title race would roll on to the Korean Grand Prix on October 16.
