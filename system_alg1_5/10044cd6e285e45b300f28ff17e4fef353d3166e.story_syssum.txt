According to the data, which is tracked by Kantar Media/Campaign Media Analysis Group, one of the groups that spent the most is AARP, which funneled about $10.3 million into ads in favor of the law.
But AARP's pro-reform ads were largely an exception, the data shows.
The 60 Plus Association, which characterizes itself as the conservative alternative to AARP, spent $1.6 million on 2,861 spots.
Restore our Future, the independent super PAC supporting Romney, spent $1.36 million on 3,589 spots.
Drew Westen, an Emory University psychology professor who wrote "The Political Brain," said the ad debate is about much more than health care.
"If I were a Republican candidate I would fill the airwaves with attack ads against Obamacare, just like they are doing, because this is one of the weakest links for this administration," Westen said.
The delay in implementing that provision, Westen says, let conservative groups run ads against the law before Americans experienced its benefits.
No matter what decision the U.S. Supreme Court reaches on the legislation, he says, expect to see more ads on health care in the future.
