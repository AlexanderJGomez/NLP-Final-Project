"I can understand why the police made the application," she told journalists outside the court Monday, according to local media.
Reports of the arrest and the care and protection order application attracted widespread criticism among protestors as such applications are usually made by the Social Welfare Department, not the police, and are usually made in cases where a child is at risk.
Last week, police withdrew an application for a care and protection order for a 14-year-old boy last week.
The boy was arrested during the police clear out of the Mong Kok protest site last year.
Hong Kong Police have not responded to requests for comment.
