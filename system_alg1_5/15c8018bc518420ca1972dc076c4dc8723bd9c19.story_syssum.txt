(CNN) -- Police in Albuquerque, New Mexico, released a composite image Tuesday of a young boy found buried beneath the sand of a local playground.
Before the composite image was created, police weren't able to release a photo of the boy because his body was so disfigured by the sand's heat.
"We have canvassed the entire adjoining neighborhood," Walsh said.
But still, nobody has come forward."
"He doesn't have a family," Lesperance told KOAT-TV.
