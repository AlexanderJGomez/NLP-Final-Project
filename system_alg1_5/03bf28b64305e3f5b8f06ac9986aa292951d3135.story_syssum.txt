His eyes moist and lower lip trembling, Clint Romesha nodded haltingly at family, comrades, military brass and the president standing to applaud him for receiving the nation's highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor.
In conferring the medal, President Barack Obama described the conditions faced by Romesha and 52 other soldiers when they came under attack from mortar, rocket-propelled grenade, machine-gun and sniper fire on October 3, 2009, at Combat Outpost Keating in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan.
"The attackers had the advantage, the high ground, the mountains above, and they were unleashing everything they had -- rocket-propelled grenades, heavy machine guns, mortars, snipers taking aim."
Later in the battle, Romesha and his team charged more than 100 yards through enemy fire to reach wounded soldiers in the outpost, Obama added.
"Colin is not as shy as Clint," Obama said.
When it ended, with Romesha and others having held onto the outpost, more than half of their 53-soldier contingent had been killed or wounded.
A few months later, a U.S. military investigation found that measures taken to protect the outpost were lax, and critical intelligence and reconnaissance assistance had been diverted from the base.
