Editor's note: Dr. Vance Harris is a primary care physician in Redding, California.
Let me share with you why we are losing so many primary care doctors.
In doing so, I save the system tens of thousands of dollars.
Few of these patients are happy no matter how many times I explain that it is reasonable to treat their reflux symptoms for several weeks before endoscopy.
My reward is another $55.
My reward for years of struggle is a few hundred dollars at best.
I am in my 22nd year in practice, now caring for 3,600 patients.
That's why I went into medicine.
Good luck recruiting primary care specialists when we are projected to be short 39,000 by 2020, according to the American Academy of Family Physicians.
Now that is ironic.
