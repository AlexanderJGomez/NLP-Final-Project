People should demand public statements like, "I condemn this act," from those who have some kind of accountability in connection with the act.
In connection with the recent Paris killings, some mainstream commentators such as New York Times columnist Roger Cohen ask why "moderate" Muslims cannot simply "come out and say" that "I do not support this."
Moreover, it is Muslims themselves who stand to lose the most when crimes are committed by these vigilantes.
If the goal of our detractors were really to get Muslims to do more "speaking out," then what Muslims have already done would have been enough years ago.
For Barney Frank, this refusal to follow the script was to "condone their terrible acts with qualified condemnation"  while Roger Cohen laments our use of, "Yes, but."
but Western commentators choose to dwell on what innocent Muslims are going to do about it, or whether Islam is to blame.
Do they fear they might bring to light crimes, much greater crimes, that they themselves should have "spoken out" about long ago?
