Children, military families and the long-term unemployed -- and it's taking a toll on the nation's health.
Many of the people we serve struggle not only to get enough to eat, but also to keep a roof over their heads, the lights on in their homes, and to cover their  healthcare and medicine costs," said Bob Aiken, CEO of Feeding America, in a statement.
