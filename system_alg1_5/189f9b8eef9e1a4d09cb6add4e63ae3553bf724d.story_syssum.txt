(CNN) -- In the cold, predawn hours of February 20, 2007, shortly after 4 a.m., armed men stormed into the home I owned with my family and burst into my bedroom, shouting at me to show my hands.
They interrogated my 12-year-old daughter and ordered my brother, a U.S. citizen since he was a teenager, to produce his papers.
When they left, they threatened to return.
During those raids in 2006 and 2007, thousands of terrified people, mostly Latino, were pulled out of bed.
In the home of three of the other people in our case, ICE knew it had already deported the person it were seeking.
It seemed that being Latino, and nothing more, was enough to arouse suspicion.
But that night in 2007, and in the months after, I lost a sense of hope in our government's ability to make its own agents obey the law.
