Christians in Karachi, Pakistan, on Monday protest the slayings of seven Christians in weekend violence.
About 50 houses were burned down, and more than 100 were looted by the protesters, Bhatti said.
Kamran Michael, Punjab provincial minister for human rights and minority affairs, who is a Christian, told CNN after meeting with Pakistan's Christian leaders in Gojra that a consensus had been reached to observe three days of mourning, from Monday to Wednesday, for the attack on the Christians.
He called the law unjust and misused, and he strongly condemned it, demanding that it be amended because of its misuse against minorities.
