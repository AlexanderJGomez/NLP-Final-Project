A Washoe County, Nevada, jury convicted James Michael Biela, 28, of first-degree murder and sexual assault in the death of Brianna Denison.
Denison, a sophomore at Santa Barbara City College in California, was last seen alive on her friend's couch on January 20, 2008.
The second woman, a student at the university, testified she was abducted outside her apartment and driven to a dark area and raped in the attacker's vehicle.
While she slept, someone crept into the apartment and snatched her, police and prosecutors said.
A friend of Biela's girlfriend saw the photo of the panties, and thought she recognized the truck police described.
Biela's defense attorneys challenged the DNA testing method, claiming it was not accurate.
