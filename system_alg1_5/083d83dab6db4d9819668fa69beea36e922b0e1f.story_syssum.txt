How the Scouts handled the case of the former Scout leader, Timur Dykes, was at the center of the explosive lawsuit.
Before the trial, he alleged that when his clients were boys during the 1980s, the organization knew that at least one of them had been abused by Dykes.
Once the Scouts did learn about it, the organization acted immediately and cooperated with police, the Scouts' lawyers said.
"We are gravely disappointed with the verdict," it said.
The church has sponsored a number of Boy Scout troops, including the one to which the plaintiff belonged.
"The church absolutely condemns any kind of child abuse," he said.
