Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- A dozen more people have died during ongoing sectarian violence in Myanmar's western state of Rakhine, bringing the death toll from the unrest to 62, a local official said Wednesday.
Violence between Buddhists and Muslims then spread across the northern part of the state, resulting in the destruction of thousands of homes and the deaths of about 50 people, according to the government.
But the Bangladeshi authorities have turned them back, saying they already have too many Rohingya refugees.
"The situation in northern Rakhine State remains very tense," the human rights group Amnesty International said in a statement Tuesday.
