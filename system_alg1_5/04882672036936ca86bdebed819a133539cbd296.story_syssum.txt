(CNN) -- The crew members of a North Korean freighter regained control of their ship from pirates who hijacked the vessel off Somalia, but not without a deadly fight, the U.S. Navy reported Tuesday.
The bandits had seized the ship's bridge, while the crew kept control of the steering gear and engines, the Navy said.
A second U.S. Navy destroyer was searching waters off Somalia for pirates who hijacked a Japanese-owned ship, military officials said.
The guided-missile destroyer USS Arleigh Burke has been pursuing the pirates after entering Somali waters with the permission of the troubled transitional government in Mogadishu, U.S. officials said Monday.
Four other ships in the region remain in pirate hands, the Navy said.
In May, a U.S. Navy advisory warned merchant ships to stay at least 200 miles off the Somali coast.
The agency issued a new warning to sailors in the Gulf of Aden, between Somalia and Yemen, after Sunday's hijacking.
