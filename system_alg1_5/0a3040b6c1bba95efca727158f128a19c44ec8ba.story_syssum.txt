What Domingues did was legally register the trio as a "stable union," a civil union that extends all of the benefits of marriage, though there is debate about what rights the threesome will actually enjoy.
"This union is void of any legality," said Regina Beatriz Tavares da Silva, head of the family law committee of a lawyers' association in Sao Paulo.
"It goes directly against the constitution," da Silva said.
The controversial civil union "is proof that there is a plurality of familiar relations, though not all deserve judicial or legal standing," Rolf Madaleno, director of the Brazilian Institute for Family Law, said in a statement.
Brazil is known for its progressive social policies and openness, as reflected in the status conferred to the trio, though the country is stereotyped, too.
"By registering them, I only confirmed that they recognize themselves as a family," she said.
Da Silva called the civil union "deceitful," a runaround to grant status to a polygamous relationship.
Her dissertation, she said, is about "how you can love more than one person at the same time."
"We have had all the reactions you can imagine," she said.
