A prosecutor called the case a "perfect storm" with "no bad guys," but the family has said police used excessive force.
In the interrogation video, which was first posted on The Guardian's website on Sunday, a police detective repeatedly presses Crawford's tearful girlfriend, asking her where Crawford got the gun he had in the store.
"I don't know," she replies.
"Not that I.
"Don't tell me, 'not that you know,' because that's the first thing that I realize that somebody's not telling me the truth, when they say that kind of stuff," Curd says.
"Well, to let you know, John has passed away as a result of this," the detective says.
"What happened there wasn't a good thing and as a result of his actions, he is gone."
"I also learned while on scene that the rifle involved was a pellet gun that was taken from a box while he was inside the store," he wrote.
He was just shopping," he said.
"It is very hard to tell the difference," Piepmeier said.
"The officers ran into an aisle, saw a black man with what they perceived to be a gun, and shot him on sight," he said.
