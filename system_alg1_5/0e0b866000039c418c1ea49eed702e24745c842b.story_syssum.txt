When asked when the ship might have been looted, Clifford said he didn't know.
"I'm not looking for money," Clifford said.
But, Clifford told CNN, archaeologists at the time "misdiagnosed" the cannon.
But some items, including the cannon, had been looted from the ship in the intervening years, Clifford said.
The ship was found in the exact area where Columbus said the Santa Maria ran aground more than 500 years ago, Clifford said.
That December, the Santa Maria accidentally ran aground off the island's coast.
"We don't have very accurate records of what they looked like," he said.
