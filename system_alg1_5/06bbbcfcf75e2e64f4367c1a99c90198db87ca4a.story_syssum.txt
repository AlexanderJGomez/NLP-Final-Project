Indian police have arrested a second man in connection with the rape of a 5-year-old girl in New Delhi, a police spokesman said Monday.
Doctors said they had to remove objects, including candle pieces and a small bottle, from the girl's genitals.
The case of the 5-year-old has now drawn attention to violent crimes against children, particularly girls.
The 5-year-old girl's case sparked protests in New Delhi last week.
