One of Benedict XVI's last acts as pope, according to Vatican Radio, was to authorize the broadcast of video of the shroud from Turin Cathedral, where the mysterious Christian relic is kept, out of sight, in a bulletproof, climate-controlled glass case.
Many scholars contest the shroud's authenticity, saying it dates to the Middle Ages, when many purported biblical relics -- like splinters from Jesus' cross -- surfaced across Europe.
"This image, impressed upon the cloth, speaks to our heart," he said.
Until now, researchers have not had access to a digitalized picture of the shroud, he told CNN.
"We carried out three alternative dating tests on the shroud, two chemical and one mechanical, and they all gave the same result and they all traced back to the date of Jesus, with a possible margin of error of 250 years," Fanti told CNN.
He chose to put the shroud's image on his book cover "because it's simply an icon of Jesus in this generation," he said, whether its origins are proven or not.
Before that, it was last on display in 2000.
