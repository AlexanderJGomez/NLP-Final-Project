The passengers are Delavar Seyed Mohammad Reza, 29, and Pouri Nourmohammadi, 18.
To fly out of Malaysia, Reza and Nourmohammadi used passports that were stolen in Thailand, a booming market for stolen passports.
The Austrian, Christian Kozel, 30, had his stolen in July 2013.
The ticket numbers are consecutive, implying they were issued together.
"If you read what the head of Malaysia police said recently, about (Nourmohammadi) ... wanting to travel to Frankfurt, Germany, to be with his mother, (this) is part of a human smuggling issue and not a terrorist issue," Interpol's Noble said.
Countries, not airlines, have access to Interpol's data, and many governments don't routinely check passports against the database.
"Unfortunately, this is quite common."
