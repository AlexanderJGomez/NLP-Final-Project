Baltimore County, Maryland, police say Parente, 59, killed his family before committing suicide.
The source did not know whether Parente, of Garden City, New York, had actually used the money for any legitimate investments.
Police have said Parente's wife, Betty, 58, and daughters Catherine, 11, and Stephanie, 19, were killed by asphyxiation and blunt force trauma Sunday afternoon.
Also Friday, other details emerged about some of Parente's other clients.
The clients are from New York, New Jersey, California and Florida, according to Montague's office.
Montague was told Parente's account was empty, according to Gardy, and it would be useless to deposit other checks received from Parente.
Gardy said Montague believed he was investing in real estate notes -- short-term, high-interest loans made to developers, for example, who wanted to circumvent conventional bank loans.
Funerals for Parente's wife and daughters are scheduled for Tuesday at St. Joseph's Catholic Church in Garden City, New York.
