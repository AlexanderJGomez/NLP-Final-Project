(CNN) -- Over the past couple of weeks, I have been asking random people who identify as Republicans if they trust Mitt Romney, and each of them gave me an answer like this -- "I trust him more than I trust Obama."
Misspeaks.
He hasn't.
Obama was for gay marriage, then he was against it, and now he's for it again.
It's about Romney.
Because if he wins, saying "I trust him more than I trust Obama" is not going to help matters in January.
Trust him with our taxes, he says.
I don't think you can.
Which I guess is why many Republicans have a hard time saying they do.
