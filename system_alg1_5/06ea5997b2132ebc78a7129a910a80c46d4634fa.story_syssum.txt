The truth is that the reductions in spending that will take place over the next year will, at a minimum, have no positive impact on the economy.
In the worst case, the cuts could lead to increased unemployment and slower, if not negative, economic growth.
According to University of California, Berkeley professor Emmanuel Saez, fully 93% of the increase in total U.S. family income in 2010, the first full year of recovery, went to the top 1%.
The most effective way to promote that result, particularly now, given the economy's current slow growth trajectory, is to invest strategically in the economy in a manner that will provide the incentives for new private investment, business growth and ultimately job creation.
Infrastructure investments could include bridge and highway construction and repair, new commuter and high-speed rail lines, upgrading communications systems, renovating or building new schools, community colleges and state-of-the art job training facilities, investing in dams, waterways and water treatment facilities, reclaiming key wetlands, and improving the basic livability of impoverished neighborhoods.
Yet none of those conversations have led, nor are likely to lead, to the creation of a single job.
