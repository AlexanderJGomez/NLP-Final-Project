NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- A stampede at a hilltop temple in western India killed more than 147 people and wounded 55 others who had gathered to celebrate the start of a religious holiday on Tuesday, police said.
The crowd had gathered to celebrate the start of Navaratri, or nine nights.
Temple stampedes are not uncommon in India during religious festivals.
That stampede, which occurred on the second day of a nine-day religious festival at the Naina Devi Temple in Himachal Pradesh state, apparently was triggered by a false rumor of a landslide on the hill above the crowd.
