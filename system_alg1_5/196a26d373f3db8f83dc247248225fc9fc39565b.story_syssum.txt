Prosecutors say Carl Pistorius was driving recklessly in Vanderbijlpark, South Africa, when he crashed with the motorcyclist in the daytime.
Carl Pistorius was initially scheduled to go on trial Thursday -- during the middle of his brother's four-day bail hearing.
Pistorius says he thought Steenkamp, 29, was an intruder.
It's unknown whether Oscar Pistorius will be in court to support his brother during his trial.
