The attacks in Luhansk began early Monday when least 100 militants tried to storm the border unit on the southern edge of the city, said Oleg Slobodyan, the spokesman for the Ukrainian State Border Guard Service.
Eight border guards have also been wounded in the fighting, Slobodyan said.
Still, the military was able to take out two mortar sites from the air, he said.
Meanwhile, seven people were killed Monday by an explosion at the regional government building in Luhansk, health officials said.
