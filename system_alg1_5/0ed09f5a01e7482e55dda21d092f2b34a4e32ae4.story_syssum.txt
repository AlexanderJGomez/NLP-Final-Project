Two years after its launch, Mdundo, a Kenya-based online music distributor, has grown into a major provider of East African music with a 20,000 track strong library on its mobile web platform.
Aside from providing a useful service for music-loving mobile users, Mdundo is also helping to raise the profile of East African artists.
After a month, in December 2012, the service officially launched in partnership with Airtel Kenya.
And now, with advertising clients including Microsoft, Samsung and Nokia, 6,000 artists signed up and 250,000 people having downloaded music, the startup has ambitious plans for the future.
