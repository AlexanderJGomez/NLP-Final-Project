News of Carey's departure came out first Thursday, in the form of a tweet posted on her official account that stated she was saying "goodbye 2 idol" (and, simultaneously, announced a new world tour).
Players behind "American Idol" -- namely Fox, FremantleMedia and 19 Entertainment -- confirmed her departure in a statement.
"Nicki Minaj is a superstar who brought a level of honesty and passion to 'American Idol' and who had a tremendous positive impact on so many contestants this season," they said.
"Idol" had topped the Nielsen charts as America's most watched program for eight years running.
"It's been a life-changing opportunity, but I am looking forward to focusing on my company, Dream Merchant 21, and other business ventures," the musician and producer said.
