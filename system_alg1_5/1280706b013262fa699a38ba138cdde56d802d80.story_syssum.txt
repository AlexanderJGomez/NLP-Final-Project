Marlon Jackson: I talked to Frank Dileo, Michael's manager.
That's what happened.
Jackson: He wasn't in a wheelchair.
We all talked.
I talked to Jackie.
It was a shock to them, too.
Jackson: Michael had passed.
Martin: Marlon, it's amazing to look at the reaction from all over the world.
That's the way we thought.
He's definitely going to be missed.
Jackson: He's going to live on.
He's going to live forever.
It's hard.
It hurts.
