Hassan Rouhani, in an interview with NBC News, characterized ISIS's recent beheadings of three Western captives are offensive to all people, including Muslims like himself.
The only relevant thing about the victims is that they were innocent, not their nationalities or religions, according to Rouhani.
"It doesn't make any difference, from our viewpoint, if the person is Muslim, Jewish, Christian or (a) follower of any other religion.
In his NBC interview, Rouhani did not appear supportive or impressed with Washington's plan to form a coalition -- one which he called "ridiculous" -- or its using airstrikes, rather than ground forces, to combat the ISIS threat.
"Maybe it is necessary for airstrikes in some conditions and some circumstances," Rouhani told NBC's Ann Curry.
"The alliance ... for confronting this terrorist group is an effort to forge safe borders for the Zionist regime rather than bring about regional stability and security for the oppressed people of the (Middle East)," he said.
