In the early morning hours of February 3, 1959, a small aircraft carrying Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson crashed a few miles from Mason City Municipal Airport, near Clear Lake, Iowa.
Coon, a self-described retired pilot and aircraft dispatcher, asking it to look at other possible contributing factors to the crash.
"You have gotten our attention," the NTSB wrote in February, saying it would examine the information he provided, Coon's email said.
Country legend Waylon Jennings, then Holly's bass player, gave up his seat to a sick Richardson.
The crash has inspired generations of artists.
