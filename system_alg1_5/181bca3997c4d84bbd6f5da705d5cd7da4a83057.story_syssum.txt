More than five hours after the blast, rescuers had pulled at least one survivor from the rubble, Mexico's president said in a Twitter post.
The explosion tore through the building "from the inside out," he said, and rescuers found many people trapped.
... You could see pieces of the wall falling to the ground," said Joaquin Borrell Valenzuela, an attorney for the Pemex comptroller's office, who was in a courtyard outside the building at the time of the blast.
"Entering the building, we smelled a strong odor of gas," said Christopher Rangel, a paramedic and firefighter.
At least 14 people were hospitalized with injuries, and two of them were in serious condition, the state-run Notimex news agency reported.
The state oil company's director, who was on a business trip in South Korea this week, said in a Twitter post that he would return to Mexico immediately.
"Unfortunately, we lost communication with him," Rangel said.
