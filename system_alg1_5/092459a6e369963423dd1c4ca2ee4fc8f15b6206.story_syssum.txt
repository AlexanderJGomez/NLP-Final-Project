One of Mexico's most notorious accused drug lords, Edgar "La Barbie" Valdez Villarreal, was also indicted in the case Tuesday, but authorities did not specify the connection between him and the military officials.
"While the army is in the streets, when there are these kinds of topics that are very sensitive coming up, it seems to me that we must look at this process with all the transparency in the world so that there aren't any doubts about the fair trial that everyone deserves, including the generals," Sen. Ruben Camarillo of the conservative National Action Party told Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency.
The military officials were arrested in May, but Tuesday's indictment marked the first time formal charges were brought against them.
"If proven, the full weight of the law must be applied because they have been federal government officials and are responsible for combating organized crime, and if they are colluding with them the punishment should set an example," legislator Arturo Santana told state-run media.
