"He's asking you to pay more so people like him can get a big tax cut," Obama told more than 2,000 supporters in Mansfield, the first of two Ohio stops Wednesday.
Earlier, the Romney campaign launched a potentially risky ad challenging the Obama administration's auto industry bailout, which is credited with saving General Motors and Chrysler.
"If today were November 6, President Barack Obama would sweep the key swing states of Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania and -- if history is any guide -- into a second term in the Oval Office," wrote Peter A.
"If that were true, Obama's negatives would be much worse," Schiller said.
However, Romney has yet to say which specific tax breaks he plans to eliminate, and the Tax Policy Center report indicated the result of his plan would force the tax burden to shift toward lower- and middle-class Americans.
"This includes me, by the way."
In its study, the Tax Policy Center did not score Romney's plan directly, saying it lacked sufficient details.
Think about that," Obama said.
Jen Psaki, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign, said the Romney ad was surprising, adding that the president's actions on the auto industry saved 2,200 dealership jobs in Ohio alone.
Last week, the RNC started spending some of the funds it is allowed to use to coordinate with the Romney campaign.
Obama's campaign responded to the ad by citing Romney's opposition to the auto industry bailout.
