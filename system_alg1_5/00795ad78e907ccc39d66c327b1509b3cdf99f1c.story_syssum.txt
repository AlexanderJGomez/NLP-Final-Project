Larry Norman sang about drugs, politics, racism, sex and Jesus -- sometimes in the same song.
His first solo album, "Upon This Rock," came out in late 1969, after he left the band People!
"It was a pretty gutsy move to sing about Jesus on his first record," younger brother Charles Norman said.
" 'Upon This Rock' was written to stand outside the Christian culture," Larry Norman said in an interview with CCM magazine.
No small surprise, given that rock music at the time was the soundtrack of the counterculture and was far from the mainstream.
Then there were the lyrics, especially on Norman's second solo effort, 1972's "Only Visiting This Planet."
Nearly two decades after its release, "Only Visiting This Planet," helmed by Beatles' producer George Martin, was recognized as a seminal recording for the genre, voted by CCM magazine in 1990 as the greatest Christian album ever recorded.
In 1971, Billboard Magazine called Norman "the most important writer since Paul Simon," while Time magazine pegged him as "probably the top solo artist in the field."
It just all sounded horrible," Richard said on "Rockspell," a Gospel-music-themed BBC television show he hosted in 1986, and on which Norman appeared.
"While Larry is always referenced by his Christian beliefs, to me he was always an entertainer ... humorous, poignant and always rock 'n' roll.
"Before Larry Norman, there was not any Christian music industry," said Shawn McSpadden, manager for Switchfoot and the Grammy Award-winning band Third Day.
Norman, a hippie musician who set out to sing about his faith, blazed the trail for Christian rock.
