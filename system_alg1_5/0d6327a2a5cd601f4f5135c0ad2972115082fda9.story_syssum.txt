All eyes were on British supermodel Jean Shrimpton as she arrived at the prestigious Melbourne Cup Carnival -- or more accurately, all attention was focused on the 22-year-old's legs.
"The most beautiful girl in the world" had stepped out at Flemington Racecourse wearing a minidress five inches above her knees, with no hat, stockings or gloves.
"There she was, the world's highest-paid model, snubbing the iron-clad conventions at fashionable Flemington in a dress five inches above the knee, NO hat, NO gloves, and NO stockings!"
The face of "Swinging Sixties London" was flown to other side of the world to promote DuPont's new fabric, Orlon, during the four days of the Melbourne Cup Carnival -- Derby Day, Melbourne Cup, Oakes Day and Stakes Day.
"It had an enormous impact on the fashion world," Tripp said.
Today, more than 350,000 people attend the Melbourne Cup Carnival, with 1,100 men and women taking part in last year's "Fashions on the Field" event.
"I think to the rest of the world, the Melbourne Cup probably looks like one big party -- and that's exactly what it is," said Angela Menz, the 2011 fashion competition winner.
"Head wear has been getting quite sculptural, almost like a piece of art on the head," she said.
