While some regulation is needed, the current proposal entails a huge paperwork burden that will create a barrier to entry into the market for all but the biggest players -- namely, Big Tobacco.
Electronic cigarettes, also known as vapor products, are designed to mimic the experience of smoking.
The e-cigarette industry is young, thriving and innovative.
In Britain, an estimated 700,000 people (5% of all smokers) have transitioned to vapor products, mostly in the past two years.
All consumer products are regulated, and e-cigarettes should not be an exception.
Meanwhile, Big Tobacco is muddling along, rolling out its vapor products with their underpowered batteries and limited capacity for e-liquid.
The FDA should consider creating a tailored regulatory framework, one that would allow the e-cigarette industry to continue innovating to the point that smoked tobacco is made redundant, which could help save many lives worldwide.
It's about burdens.
