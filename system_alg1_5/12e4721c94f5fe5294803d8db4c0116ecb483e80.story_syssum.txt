As protesters packed Cairo's Tahrir Square, the head of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces issued warning of "dire consequences" if the nation's political crisis continues, state-run Al-Masriya TV reported.
Ganzouri, who was Egypt's prime minister from 1996 to 1999, is to remain as prime minister until at least January 10, when results of the parliamentary elections are finalized, said Aly Hassan, a judicial consultant.
"Gazouri's government was born dead, and he doesn't have any legitimacy on the Egyptian street," he told Al-Masriya.
Ballot boxes will be locked at 7 p.m. Monday and new boxes will be used on Tuesday, Ahmed Al Zind, head of Judicial Club, told reporters Saturday.
The elections will also be observed by a delegation from the International Republican Institute as well as a U.S. congressional delegation "to identify and evaluate strengths and weaknesses in Egypt's election system, including campaign regulations, the balloting process, vote tabulation and reporting," the institute said Friday.
