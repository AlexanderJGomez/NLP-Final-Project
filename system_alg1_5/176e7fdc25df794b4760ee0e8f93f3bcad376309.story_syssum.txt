Not just for an electric car, but for traditional petrol-engine cars as well.
Its precocious 25-year-old inventor, Mate Rimac, says that the car produces 1018 horsepower, can accelerate from 0 to 100 kph (62 mph) in just 2.8 seconds, has a top speed of 305 kph (190 mph), and can travel 600 kilometers (372 miles) on a single charge.
Not just city cars for boring stuff, but to show people that the future will be interesting -- that one day when petrol is gone and you only have electric cars in the world, you won't have to compromise in terms of performance, speed or (how) far (it can go)."
After several years of rebuilding and alteration, Rimac set a world record with his car, which became the fastest accelerating electric car in the world.
And we did all that with less than 0.1% of the budget which is usual in the car industry," Rimac says.
Still, the notion that an electric car might soon not just match, but outperform the best petrol vehicles on the planet is certainly a captivating one.
