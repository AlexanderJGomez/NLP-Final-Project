However, John Doxey found out before she could tell him, and that's when Paviglianiti claims her job became threatened.
Up until she became pregnant, the 29-year-old says she had been one of the club's most popular bartenders.
In other recordings, Doxey is heard suggesting that Paviglianiti's appearance is hurting business.
In this case, that means Paviglianiti would have had to be hired as a "model and a bartender" and get a written agreement to this -- as is done in the casino industry, Bond said on HLN Prime News with Mike Galanos.
However, Doxey's attorney says this proves she was never fired and her job duties were only adjusted to accommodate her pregnancy.
