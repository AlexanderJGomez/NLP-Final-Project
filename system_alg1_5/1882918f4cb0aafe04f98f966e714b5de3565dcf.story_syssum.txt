But the news came too late for Jevon Thomas, a worker who died of a rare cancer in April, penniless and distraught.
He didn't want to talk to anybody," says his daughter, Monet Thomas.
"I'm so grateful cancers were included, but when I'm reminded of the people who've died, I get a pain in my heart," Crane says.
His physician, Dr. Iris Udasin at Rutgers University, found him as much charity care as possible, but his family suffered financially as Thomas' wife is disabled and couldn't work to support their two young children.
"Instead of everyone uniting, coming together, and figuring out a way to help you, they're figuring out a way of not helping you to save a dollar," Thomas said in 2010.
"I feel like I'm going nowhere," she says.
When CNN interviewed Thomas two years ago, he said he was "100% sure" his cancer came from his work at ground zero.
"They were trying to do this in an absolutely scientific way, according to rigorous principles of epidemiology, which is important to do," Crane adds.
"He would be crying right now," she said when she heard about the decision.
"He was proud of what he did," she says.
