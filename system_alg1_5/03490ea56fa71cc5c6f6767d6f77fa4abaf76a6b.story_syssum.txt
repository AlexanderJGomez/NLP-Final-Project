(CNN) -- If you're walking along the east African coast and chance upon a herd of brightly-striped elephants, flame-hued rhinos and a tower of crazily-colored giraffes, then don't panic, you're not hallucinating -- and neither have you stumbled on a psychedelic new species, sorry.
"It's a trade-based solution to the global problem of marine pollution," says Julie Church, the co-founder of Ocean Sole.
"Pollution in all our waterways is a big problem," says Church, who was born and raised in Kenya.
Fish, whales, sharks are digesting that plastic and sooner or later that's going to work its way into our food chain."
Ocean Sole, which provides direct employment today to more than 70 people, aims to recycle 400,000 flip-flops every year.
"We are focused mainly on animals," says Church.
"Certainly about the ocean, doing that through the business of recycling rubber that floats," she continues, "and doing it independently in a relative sustainable and grown up way where you have to have a market and a good product, you've got to be commercial," adds Church.
