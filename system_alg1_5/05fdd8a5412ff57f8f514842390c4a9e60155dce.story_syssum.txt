"So far as we know, the guns never killed anybody," says Pierre Terjanian, the head of the Arms and Armor department at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, where a collection of seven such guns is kept.
"At the time, a great aura surrounded the Wild West in Europe," says Terjanian.
Tiffany & Co also produced a Winchester rifle, which was famously used in the conquest of the West.
In all, about 50 guns were produced by Tiffany.
They surprised and impressed everybody, and acted as ambassadors for Tiffany & Co and for the United States."
