He remembers, he says, because she looked especially beautiful.
Four days later, Aqsa called her parents back in Scotland, just as she was crossing into Syria from its border with Turkey.
Her recent posting online has called to follow the example set by "brothers from Woolwich, Texas, and Boston."
She was a bedroom radical.
"She was the best daughter you could have.
She was very friendly.
She grew more religious, praying and reading the Quran.
We all went together," Muzaffar says.
"I know she is my daughter, but I feel that she is my friend.
Soon after her arrival in Syria, Aqsa told her family that she would marry.
Don't worry.
Obviously, no Muslim approves this."
In one of the exchanges Muzaffar had with his daughter, she told him that she is praying every day to become "shahid," or a martyr.
In a special message to Aqsa through CNN, her parents made a personal appeal to their daughter.
We love her.
I love you.
I love you, my dear daughter.
Any killing we are against, whoever it is.
But they say they are still holding hope that one day, she will come back.
