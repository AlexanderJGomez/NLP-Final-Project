European Union and Middle East intelligence agencies had identified an "imminent threat" to Belgium, and possibly to the Netherlands, the source told CNN.
• The suspected Islamist terrorists who had a shootout with police on Thursday in Verviers, Belgium, have ties to ISIS-linked cells in other European countries, a senior Belgian counterterrorism source told CNN's Paul Cruickshank.
• Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, Britain's senior counterterrorism officer, said additional police patrols were being put in place at Jewish community centers, synagogues and schools.
• Two people suspected of involvement with the alleged terror cell in Verviers were detained trying to cross from France into Italy through the Frejus tunnel, a spokesman for Belgium's federal prosecutor's office said.
• The suspected terror cell, which included people returning from Syria, planned to target police officers, Van der Sypt said.
• The Netherlands said it was not raising its terror threat level, currently at "substantial," the second-highest .
"That means there is a realistic threat, but no concrete or specific information of an attack," said government spokesman Edmond Messchaert.
Neetin Karasular, a suspected Belgian trafficker in weapons who met with Coulibaly's widow, Hayat Boumeddiene, is in custody, Karasular's attorney, Michel Bouchat, told CNN.
The official, who cited France, the United Kingdom and Belgium as countries facing a particular threat, said counterterrorism agencies in Germany are on high alert.
