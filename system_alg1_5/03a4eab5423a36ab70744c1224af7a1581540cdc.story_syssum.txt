Seau's parents, who are from the island of Aunu'u, American Samoa, were meeting Monday with Samoan elders, according to Shawn Mitchell, who was Seau's pastor.
Researchers have contacted the Seau family to request the opportunity to study his brain, Mitchell said last week.
He suffered many concussions, so there is a strong sense that it played a role," said Mitchell, who is also the chaplain for the San Diego Chargers, the team for which Seau played 13 seasons.
"Any allegation that the NFL intentionally sought to mislead players has no merit," it said.
"We can't know," unless Seau's brain is analyzed in this way, whether his death was related to CTE, he said.
