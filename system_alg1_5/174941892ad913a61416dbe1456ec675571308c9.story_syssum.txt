"We have somebody who served his country during World War II, was injured during his service, was a distinguished veteran," Straub said.
"We're hoping that he surrenders," the police chief said.
"He was awesome," Lillian Duncan told The Spokesman-Review newspaper.
"If he had, I would made sure I was there," Denison said.
He didn't have a lot of money," she said.
After the incident, police scoured surveillance videos, wiped a nearby chain link fence for fingerprints and used dogs to hunt for clues.
