When he came back the next morning, the food was gone, but there was nothing on the video, he said.
As he peeled it back, he spotted a kitten.
In the past, Frazier said, he has rescued stray kittens and brought them to the local Humane Society.
"She said, 'Man, you did a job on your truck.'"
A week after the rescue, the shelter invited Frazier for a reunion.
"It was almost telling me, 'Thank you for saving my life,'" he said.
Frazier's wife, Cindy, said they were touched by the outpouring of support.
"We really never expected all of this, to be honest, but God does blessings every day," Cindy Frazier said.
