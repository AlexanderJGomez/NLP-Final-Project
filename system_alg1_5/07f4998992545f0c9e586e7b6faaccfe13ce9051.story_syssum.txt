MADRID, Spain (CNN)  -- Human rights groups from the United States and Spain filed a lawsuit in a Spanish court Thursday, charging El Salvador's former president, Alfredo Cristiani, with covering up crimes against humanity.
They were killed at their residence at the prestigious Central American University, in El Salvador's capital, San Salvador.
The case was taken to Spain's National Court, because of its involvement in other high-profile human rights cases.
Family members from at least two of the slain Jesuits will join the lawsuit later, the groups said.
"We have to recognize that Cristiani is a man of his word, who keeps his promises," Ellecuria told CNN.
"We have become used to violence," Martin-Baro said.
Uniformed troops were seen searching the living quarters of the priests at Central American University two days before they were killed, CNN reported.
