At the border, before going back to China, a group of security guards confiscated my camera and erased all images they thought were inappropriate, or did not portray the country in a favorable light.
My guide, Ko Chang Ho, was surprisingly friendly and talkative.
"Go right ahead," he would say with a smile.
"No problem," said my guide.
It was all very informal.
The following day, I had my first clash with the authorities.
My guide said they were erasing "inappropriate" pictures, with no further explanation.
All the photos had been saved.
Looking at the censored photos, I was surprised about the selection.
There was an old couple walking alongside the cornfields, a family out in the countryside waving from their house, and a mother cycling with her sleeping baby on a seat on the back of her bike.
