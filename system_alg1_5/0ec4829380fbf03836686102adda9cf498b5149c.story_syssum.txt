Now, Iqbal is considering suing the U.S. government for unlawful detention.
His attorney in Washington, Richard Cys, said he is considering a lawsuit against the U.S. government, on behalf of Iqbal, but the details of the suit have not been worked out.
"I never [made] that statement," Iqbal said.
Iqbal says while in U.S. custody, he was taken to Egypt, then to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan.
Four of the prisoners died, according to Iqbal.
Former President Bush and other senior officials have repeatedly denied that the U.S. government used torture to extract intelligence from terror suspects.
He returned to Pakistan, walking with the help of a cane, complaining of back pain, a bad leg and a torn eardrum -- all the result, he says, of his time in custody.
Despite his anger and his physical ailments, Iqbal says he "was born again and given a new life from God" after his release.
