However, mandating that home care workers be eligible for overtime pay will have the opposite effect.
As the head of a home care agency in Massachusetts, I am required by state law to pay overtime to caregivers who are eligible.
Imagine you are hiring, either directly or through a home care agency, someone to help keep a parent safe and comfortable at home.
If your caregiver wants the extra income, you can arrange for him or her to work more than 40 hours at the wage you have agreed to.
If, like most families, you are on a budget that stretches every dollar, you would tell the first caregiver to stop work (and stop earning money) at 40 hours of service.
For a professional caregiver who wants to work more than 40 hours a week at the regular rate (and many do), that option evaporates when overtime pay is required.
Paying home care workers more money would have clear social benefits, but if it comes at the cost of pricing vulnerable seniors out of the home care market or reducing the earning potential of caregivers, then we need to rethink our laws.
