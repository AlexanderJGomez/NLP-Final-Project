The SAG Awards, which are decided exclusively by actors, are distinguished from the Globes, which are chosen by a group of about 80 members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.
"Les Miserables," a big-screen adaptation of the smash Broadway musical, was given the Golden Globe for best comedy or musical movie, although "Lincoln" lost to "Argo" in the Globe's best drama film competition.
This category pits Jessica Chastain, who played the CIA analyst who helped track down Osama bin Laden in Kathryn Bigelow's "Zero Dark Thirty," against Jennifer Lawrence, nominated for the romantic comedy "Silver Linings Playbook."
The others in this well-stocked SAG category include Philip Seymour Hoffman, who plays a spiritual leader in "The Master," Alan Arkin, for his role as a Hollywood film producer in "Argo," Robert De Niro for "Silver Linings Playbook," and Javier Bardem for his role in "Skyfall," the latest James Bond movie.
Anne Hathaway, honored with the Globe for best supporting actress for her performance in "Les Miserables," faces tough competition for the SAG and Oscar awards from Sally Field, who portrayed first lady Mary Todd Lincoln in "Lincoln."
