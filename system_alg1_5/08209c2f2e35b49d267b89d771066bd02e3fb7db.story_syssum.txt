LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Katherine Jackson's legal battle for some control of her son's estate returns to court Monday in front of the same judge who is expected to award her permanent guardianship of Michael Jackson's children.
Branca's lawyers also argued that Jackson's demand for documents was too broad and burdensome.
"Such measures will not be necessary if Mrs. Jackson is appointed a co-executor of the estate," McMillan said.
Jackson's children have been living with their paternal grandmother at her Encino, California, home since their father's death.
Rowe gave up parental rights to Jackson in 2001, but she changed her mind more than two years later and sought temporary custody of the children.
Metzger, who practices in West Hollywood, California, told Jackson during a visit to his Holmby Hills home that the drug was "dangerous and potentially life-threatening and could not be used outside of a hospital," attorney Harland Braun said.
Metzger's medical records for Jackson, whom he treated until 2003, have been given to the coroner, Braun said.
The same warrant, signed by a Las Vegas judge, implied that investigators suspected Jackson was a drug addict.
During the meeting, it was decided that an announcement of the coroner's findings would be delayed indefinitely, according to a source close to the investigation.
