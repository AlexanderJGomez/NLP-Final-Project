Or at least we assume it was clean, since Handler's final "Chelsea Lately" episode Tuesday included one of her infamous celebrity-accompanied shower scenes.
DeGeneres asked Handler, who, per usual, was stark naked.
Throughout "Chelsea Lately's" eight-season run, Handler has commandeered an unabashedly salty late night show, which on a typical night included a ring of celebrity trash-talking comedians and a celebrity interview that ran more bawdy than promotional.
On Tuesday, the former "Friends" star joined Sandra Bullock and Mary McCormack for a mock intervention (sit through it until the end; the surprise guest is worth it), and Miley Cyrus also showed up to perform a cover of Roy Orbison's "It's Over."
Stefani, who accidentally called "The Colbert Report" the "Colbore Report" at the Emmys on Monday, poked fun at her mistake by introducing Handler as her "good friend, Chelsea Hammer."
"Thank you to my family, and mom I hope you're watching me," Handler said in her goodbye speech.
