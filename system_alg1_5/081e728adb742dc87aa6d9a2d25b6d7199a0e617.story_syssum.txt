(CNN) -- A large ice shelf is "imminently" close to breaking away from part of the Antarctic Peninsula, scientists said Friday.
The Wilkins Ice Shelf -- a large mass of floating ice -- would still be connected to Latady Island, which is also part of the peninsula, and Alexander Island, which is not, said professor David Vaughan, a glaciologist at the British Antarctic Survey.
Along the coast, the ice gradually floats on the sea, forming massive ledges known as ice shelves, the ESA says.
If the ice shelf breaks away from the peninsula, it will not cause a rise in sea level because it is already floating, scientists say.
Some plants and animals may have to adapt to the collapse.
