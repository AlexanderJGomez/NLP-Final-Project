The lawsuit alleges KBR, based in Houston, Texas, and Daoud & Partners, a Jordan-based subcontractor, engineered the trafficking scheme.
The company in no way condones or tolerates unethical or illegal behavior," KBR spokeswoman Heather Browne said in a statement e-mailed to CNN.
When the Nepali men arrived in Jordan, according to the lawsuit, the contractors took their passports and drove them into Iraq.
Gurung worked in a warehouse managed by KBR and was released 15 months later by the company, according to the law firm.
"Their families went deep into debt to arrange the jobs, which they hoped would lift them out of poverty," according to the lawsuit.
