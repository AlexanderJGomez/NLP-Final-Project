Jessica Tuttle, 50, left, and Amanda Wagner, 49, have been running for more than 30 years.
"It really wakes me up in the morning," says Tuttle.
"Moderate [running], three to five miles at a time, three times a week will actually help your joints to be more resilient and function a little bit better," says Dr. Amadeus Mason at Emory Sports Medicine Center in Atlanta, Georgia.
That includes not running through pain, and resting if you have an injury, something Tuttle takes seriously.
"The biggest risk that runners will face as they age, with regard to injury, is overtraining, by far," says Mason, who recommends giving yourself a day of rest between runs, or cross-training on the non-running days.
"Members of the running group, it took them 16 years longer to reach certain levels of disability," says Chakravarty.
"I really can't imagine not running; it's that much a part of my life," says Wagner.
"And I do expect and hope to be running when I'm 60 and when I'm 70 -- I truly do."
