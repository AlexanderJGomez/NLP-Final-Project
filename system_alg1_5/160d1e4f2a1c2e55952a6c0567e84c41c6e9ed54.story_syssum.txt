One blast occurred at Suvarnabhumi Airport at 5 a.m. (2200 Tuesday GMT), an airport official said.
As the airport had been shut down, there were no controllers in the tower, AP reported.
On Tuesday thousands of anti-government protesters partially shut down Suvarnabhumi Airport, the country's main airport, an airport spokesman said.
Protesters with golf clubs and long wooden sticks also clashed with airport taxi drivers, with each side throwing things at the other.
The case was one of several lodged against Thaksin, who protesters want to return to Thailand to face trial.
