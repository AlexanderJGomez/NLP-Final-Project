Especially this year, "we've really tried to stay true to (Lucy's) vision with as much comedy as we can pack into a weekend," said Journey Gunderson, executive director of the Lucy Ball Desi Arnaz Center for Comedy.
And in her comedy, "she found a way to be clean, but still edgy."
The increased presence will hopefully kick-start the "programmatic expansion into truly being a center for comedy," she said.
Gunderson says bringing a national Comedy Hall of Fame to Jamestown, New York, could be the "most aggressive" of the four pillars in their vision.
"That's the point."
