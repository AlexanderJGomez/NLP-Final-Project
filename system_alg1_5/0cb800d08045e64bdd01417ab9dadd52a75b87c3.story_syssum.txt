R136a1, found in the RMC 136a cluster, is 10 million times brighter than the sun and is the heaviest star ever found, Crowther said Wednesday, with a mass that is roughly 265 times more than the sun.
As such, said Crowther, it is not visible to the naked eye, nor with a rooftop telescope.
"Unlike people, these kind of stars are massive when they are babies," Crowther told CNN.
Billy, in turn, wanted dad to name the monster star after him.
