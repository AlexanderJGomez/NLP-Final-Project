But the "Road to Nowhere" is alive and well.
But Palin, now the Republican vice presidential candidate, let the access road go ahead because the contract to build it had been signed, a campaign aide said.
Palin could have stopped construction of this road," said Weinstein, who wore his "Nowhere, Alaska" T-shirt to an interview with CNN.
"It'd be nice to see them put something over here now they have a road: park, picnic benches, something to get people out here," said P.J.
"I mean, it's pretty here."
But Weinstein, a Democrat, said Palin instead spent $26 million to build a road "that will not go to a bridge."
