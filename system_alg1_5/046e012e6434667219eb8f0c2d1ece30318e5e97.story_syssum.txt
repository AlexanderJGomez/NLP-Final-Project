The National Mall and the Statue of Liberty will be affected, according to John Garder, budget and appropriations legislative representative for the National Parks Conservation Association.
Jan Stoddard, marketing director for the West Yellowstone, Montana, Chamber of Commerce said the park and its visitors are the lifeblood of her community.
Last year, nonresident tourism to Montana generated approximately $253 million in federal taxes," Stoddard said.
For instance, Gettysburg National Park, which honors the famous Civil War battle, would eliminate 20% of its spring student education programs, affecting 2,400 students.
In the 2011 fiscal year, funding for the National Park Service was cut by almost $140 million.
Visitor concessions like souvenir shops, lodging, transportation, equipment rental and food services will suffer from the decrease in tourism caused by the limitation in park hours.
"I think almost any organization can sustain a 5% cut in their budget and not have it interfere with their basic mission," she said.
