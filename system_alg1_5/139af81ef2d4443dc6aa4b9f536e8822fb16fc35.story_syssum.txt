Yet, on Christmas Day, at the downtown Alamo Drafthouse Cinema at the corner of East Sixth and Trinity, vintage Austin weirdness came roaring back courtesy of the banned-in-Pyongyang film comedy, "The Interview," starring Seth Rogen and James Franco.
Since the mid-1990s, League, a smart businessman-cum-showman, has helped transform Austin from a cinema backwater to an outlaw Hollywood hub.
Calling 13 audience members to the stage as pre-showtime chorus leaders, handing out free cans of Budweiser and candy, League, in tongue-and-cheek fashion, introduced a video of Lee Greenwood crooning "God Bless the USA."
"The song is the most over-the-top patriotic song I know," League later told me.
"I was disappointed that Sony stepped back," he admits, but was pleased the company "regrouped" in time for Christmas Day.
"It made sense though," he admits, "that Sony used digital outlets."
By turning "The Interview" into a Happening, in '60s parlance, League was carrying forward the iconic Babb-Castle torch.
"And everybody who bought tickets today is a goddamn, super-duper, American hero."
At one point, before the Greenwood video, an alarm went off.
