David Croom of Apache Junction, Arizona, hasn't seen his 18-year-old son in more than a week.
"He's never been in the wild before," David Croom said.
"There were similarities," Croom said of his son's disappearance.
"It's not against the law for an adult man to decide he wants to get lost or take off," said Dwes Hutson, public information officer for the Douglas County Sheriff's Office.
"There's nothing that makes sense."
"There are houses and people, and it's well-populated, so if he wanted to do an 'Into the Wild,' it wasn't the appropriate place."
"Yeah, you could survive."
"He's been watching the movie a lot," he said.
Now joining searchers on foot and driving up logging roads in and around Riddle, David Croom hopes McCandless' story may hold some answers.
"I think his dad has that information, and I don't know, again, if that's what he wanted to do, he kind of picked the wrong place.
"They are doing the best they can, every drop of sweat, every footstep, I just wish we can do more," he said.
It's already been a week.
