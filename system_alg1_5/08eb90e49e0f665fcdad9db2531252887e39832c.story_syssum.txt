The main "downs" of buying a used car are that it's a used car, not new -- so there's no new car warranty and you are more vulnerable to used car problems that could cost you money, as well as aggravation.
(Important: Be sure to confirm the used car warranty is fully transferable.)
Do a "background check" for indications that the particular used car make/model you are considering might be a problem car: One with an unusual record of either recalls or consumer complaints.
Ask to see the used cars' service records: If these are available, it's usually a good sign the car was well cared-for, and perhaps more importantly, proof (if the records are complete) that there weren't any unusual repairs or problems.
If the used car records are not available, you should be suspicious.
I.
Lexus LS400/LS430 -- New, these large rear-drive, V-8 powered luxury sedans cost tens of thousands less than an equivalent Mercedes-Benz, BMW or Jaguar.
Acura RL -- A conservatively elegant large luxury car that, like the Lexus LS, enjoys a reputation for absolutely superb engineering and quality.
III.
Toyota 4Runner -- Considered by serious off-road drivers to be one of the best vehicles for this job (due to its agility, suspension and comparatively narrow body), the 4Runner consistently scores well when it comes to long-term durability and used car resale value, too.
VI.
Siennas are offered in a variety of configurations, including models with full-time all-wheel-drive (AWD).
