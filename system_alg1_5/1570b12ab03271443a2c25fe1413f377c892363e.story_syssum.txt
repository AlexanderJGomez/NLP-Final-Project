Iranian public opinion is deafeningly silent, a silence that even the media close to the regime has complained about.
But if this situation is sad it is also strange.
But this is not the case.
In 2009, cyberspace was a battle scene for the campaigns of candidates -- particularly reformist candidates Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, who are currently under house arrest.
The Iranian regime had different political calculations for Rafsanjani's disqualification but definitely one of them was to prevent the polarization of the election and ultimately seeing it turn into a carnival -- like in 2009 -- which was impossible to contain even after the election was over.
It was as if the soup had been served up too cold.
While there are many pages dedicated to the eight presidential candidates on Facebook -- none of which are official -- their energy level is low.
If the reformist and Green Movement -- which was formed after the disputed 2009 elections -- supporters are present on Facebook the principalist supporters of the regime have tried to "occupy" Google Plus.
The Iranian regime is not that concerned about the ghettoization or fragmentation of public spheres.
Using Slavoj Zizek's analogy, Iran's 2013 presidential election so far resembles drinking decaffeinated coffee, it tastes like coffee but you are not supposed to get a caffeine buzz from it.
