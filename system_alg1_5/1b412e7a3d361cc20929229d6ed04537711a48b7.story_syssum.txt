(Sunset) -- The old warehouses of Portland's Pearl District are home to increasingly cool cultural diversions.
For people-watching, sip wine in the loft overlooking the lobby, then settle in for Portland Center Stage's one-man play "R. Buckminster Fuller: The History (and Mystery) of the Universe."
Then there's 50 Plates, a casual bistro serving all-American classics.
(Then place your order for Thanksgiving dessert.)
The Portland International Film Festival, held in February, features nearly 100 films from more than 30 countries.
