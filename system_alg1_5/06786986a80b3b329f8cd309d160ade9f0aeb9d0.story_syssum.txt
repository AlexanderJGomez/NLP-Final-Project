Football or soccer?
The term soccer was coined as slang for "association," in England in the 1880s.
Soccer would have been used to differentiate between University sports rugby football ("rugger") and "association" football.
In later years, it became the United States Soccer Football Association and today is known as the United States Soccer Federation.
