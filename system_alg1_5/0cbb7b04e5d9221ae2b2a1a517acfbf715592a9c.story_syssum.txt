In "La Frondeuse," or "The Troublemaker," authors Alix Bouilhaguet and Christophe Jakubyszyn allege that Trierweiler had a longstanding relationship with Patrick Devedjian, a former minister for economic recovery and close ally of former President Nicolas Sarkozy.
Bouilhaguet admitted that she was "surprised" by the defamation complaint, adding that the book is an "open investigation with a true look" at Trierweiler's personality.
Trierweiler is characterized by this "abrupt iciness," the authors claim, and inside journalist circles at French newspaper Le Monde, she was labeled "Cruella."
A friend of the couple goes even further and says in the book that Trierweiler is the "Achilles heel" of Hollande, who can "potentially create a lot of problems for him."
