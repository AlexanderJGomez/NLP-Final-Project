Ruben Navarrette says Mexico isn't a failed state, but the fate of its drug war is important for US.
The Mexican drug war is the real deal, and so is the threat to both Mexico and the United States.
"Recent Mexican army and police confrontations with drug cartels have resembled small-unit combat, with cartels employing automatic weapons and grenades," the advisory reads.
But, Mexicans are quick to point out the irony.
And even though Mexico is still waiting for delivery of most of those funds, there were signals this week that the Obama administration understands the stakes involved.
A country of 110 million people, Mexico is still a functioning democracy with press freedoms and bold leaders, like Calderon, who are tackling the issue of drug violence head on.
For Mexican-Americans like me, that's cold comfort.
