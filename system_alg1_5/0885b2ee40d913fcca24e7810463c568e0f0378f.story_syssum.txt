Hassan Rouhani, who won the presidency over the weekend, said in his first news conference Monday, however, that the Islamic republic has no intention of ending its uranium-enrichment program.
Even in the West, they are facing economic problems and dilemmas, and they themselves know the sanctions are to the detriment of the West," Rouhani said, adding that Israel was the only country benefiting from them.
This will require embracing "moderation and justice, and not extremism and egoism," he said.
"As far as practice, that job will be delegated to the people themselves," he said.
As a former nuclear negotiator, he said, he would reduce the high tension between Iran and the outside world by addressing the sanctions.
He's got plenty of backing, from conservative citizens to loyalist militia groups to, most notably, the Revolutionary Guard.
Prior to Rouhani's election, Iran's Guardian Council, an unelected body made up of six clerics and six lawyers operating under the oversight of the supreme leader, drew up the restricted list of candidates from the 680 who initially registered.
