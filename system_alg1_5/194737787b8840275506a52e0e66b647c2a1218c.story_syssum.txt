Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Seven female workers were killed Saturday afternoon in yet another fire at a clothing factory in Bangladesh's capital, police said.
"There was no fire alarm in the factory, and everybody rushed to get out of the two-story building as some workers shouted they saw flames on the second floor," said Rezina Begum, one of those employees who suffered injuries.
"The factory is illegally built, and there was no fire exit," Mahbubur Rahman, the fire service and civil defense director, told reporters.
The sector earned $19 billion in the last financial year, which ended in June 2012.
