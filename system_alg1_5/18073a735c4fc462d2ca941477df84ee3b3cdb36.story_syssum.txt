The freed militants had been imprisoned in Tripoli's Abu Salim prison by Moammar Gadhafi's regime during the height of the insurgency in Iraq, according to Noman Benotman, once a senior figure in the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group.
The human rights group, which recently had a team visit the prison, estimates that before the uprising, there were a few hundred Islamists held at Abu Salim.
According to Benotman, those rounded up by the regime included militants who had tried to travel to Iraq and some who had returned from fighting against U.S. forces there.
The former leader of the LIFG, Abdullah al Sadeeq, now commands one of the most powerful rebel brigades in Tripoli, according to Benotman and, according to reports, took charge of successful rebel efforts earlier this week to storm Gadhafi's Bab al-Aziziya compound, further bolstering his prominent position in rebel ranks.
But Sadeeq has now become a powerful voice against al Qaeda's terrorism, according to Benotman, who says that Sadeeq always resisted requests by Osama bin Laden for his Libyan group to join forces with al Qaeda.
CNN interviewed leading figures of the LIFG in Abu Salim prison in Tripoli in September 2009, shortly before the group's leaders were released.
According to Benotman, the presence of former LIFG leaders in rebel ranks like Abdullah Sadeeq may help prevent this happening.
A number of jihadists, he says, have entered Libya from other Arab countries.
Neighboring Algeria, which waged a long battle against Islamist insurgents in the 1990s, has already expressed concern about the instability in Libya being exploited by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and other jihadist groups.
