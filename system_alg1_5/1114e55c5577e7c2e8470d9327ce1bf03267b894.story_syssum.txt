NEW YORK (CNN) -- Two George Washington Bridge security guards photographed sleeping on the job have been fired, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
Before releasing the photos, Lepore hesitated, knowing it would likely cost the guards their jobs.
"The first time I shrugged it off and said, 'I can't believe he's sleeping,'" said Lepore.
Three weeks later, it did happen again, but this time with a different guard, according to Lepore.
"It is unacceptable, particularly given the experience the Port Authority had with 9/11," she said, referring to the Port Authority's role as the operator of the World Trade Center.
