BEIJING, China (CNN) -- A massive fire engulfed a newly constructed, unoccupied luxury hotel in central Beijing on Monday night as crowds watched a nearby fireworks display marking the end of Lunar New Year celebrations.
"I looked and saw the huge tower full of fire, and there were hundreds of Chinese down near my apartment taking pictures," she said.
"Snow-like ashes fell as far as [half a mile] from the building and smoke eclipsed the full moon," Xinhua reported of the blaze in the capital's central business district.
It was a spectacular sight for sure," he said.
"There was a quiet concern for people that may be involved, working in the building or close to construction site," he said.
The hotel is next to a newly constructed tower for China Central Television (CCTV), but no one has moved into that building either.
"Then we looked closer and saw the flames come from the top of the building," Rice said.
It had been scheduled to open late last year, but the opening was postponed until this year, though most of the building had been constructed.
