(CNN) -- A severely disfigured woman received the nose, cheeks, upper jaw and facial tissue from a female cadaver in the first near-total face transplant in the United States, the woman's surgeon said Wednesday.
The patient is doing well, the doctors said.
In the surgery, 80 percent of the woman's face was transplanted.
"Our hope is she should be able to smile again," said Dr. Frank A. Papay, chairman of the Dermatology and Plastic Surgery Institute at the Cleveland Clinic.
"This patient exhausted all conventional means of reconstruction and is the right patient," she said.
"This patient had very robust decision-making capacity," he said.
The recipient in France, Isabelle Dinoire, had been mauled by a dog, and the Chinese man, Li Guoxing, was attacked by a bear.
Guo Shuzhong, the face transplant doctor who handled Li's case, confirmed to CNN that he died in July of unknown causes.
The current face transplant patient understood the risk of rejection and of immunosuppressants, doctors said.
"With something like a liver or kidney transplant, it's a life or death transplant," Clark said.
"At this point she can't see herself but can feel her face," Siemionow said.
"She gave a thumbs up, first indication she was comfortable," said Dr. Chad Gordon, a fellow at the clinic's department of plastic surgery.
