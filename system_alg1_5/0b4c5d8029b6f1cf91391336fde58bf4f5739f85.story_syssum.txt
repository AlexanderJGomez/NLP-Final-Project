Kia Scherr, left, says her daughter, Naomi, and  husband, Alan, were "having the times of their lives" in India.
Alan Scherr, 58, and Naomi Scherr, 13, were among 25 people who had traveled to India for a meditation retreat with Virginia-based spiritual group Synchronicity Foundation, to which the Scherrs belonged.
"[He] was panicking, and I put my hand on the back of his neck, and just saying, 'Shhh,' " she told the Nashville, Tennessee, station.
"I was taking in the enormity of the moment, thinking that this energetic child who I had been playing with in the pool the night before -- and had made a pact to do somersaults with -- was dead, shot," Ragsdale told the Post.
"Slowly, we were able to account for everyone but [Alan and Naomi Scherr]," Cannon said.
"I found and identified Alan and Naomi, who were laying under the table, heads facing each other and their arms outstretched to each other and overlapping," he said.
The trip was the first time Naomi had traveled by plane, and it was Alan's third visit to India this year, she said.
