"All the games are (worth) three points but it's important to win the derby," City manager Manuel Pelligrini told Sky Sports after the match.
"They (United) played well towards the end," City captain Vincent Kompany said.
For a minute, the league doesn't matter.
When Smalling was sent off, after picking up a second booking for a lunging tackle on James Milner that Van Gaal later described as "not very smart," it looked like the lively Argentine would find more space against United's depleted back line.
City still created chances of their own, however.
Referee Michael Oliver remained unmoved and when the ball broke to Di Maria, the Argentine's shot was brilliantly saved low down to his right by Hart.
