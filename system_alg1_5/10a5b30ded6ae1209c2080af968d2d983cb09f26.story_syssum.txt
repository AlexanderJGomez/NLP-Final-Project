At least 50 rockets were fired at Israel after the cease-fire expired Friday morning, the Israel Defense Forces said.
One strike in Gaza City killed a 10-year-old boy, said Ashraf el-Qedra, a spokesman for the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
With the cease-fire over, unrest spread to the West Bank, where a 19-year-old man was shot and killed by a Israeli soldier near a settlement east of Ramallah, medical officials told CNN.
Islamic Jihad and the Al-Nasser Salah al-Din Brigades, two militant factions that have fought alongside Hamas in Gaza under the banner of "the resistance," said they fired rockets at Israel on Friday.
Hamas denied responsibility for firing the rockets, which landed near Eshkol, said Sami Abu Zuhri, a senior spokesman for the group.
A Palestinian member of the negotiating delegation, not authorized to speak to the media directly about the talks, told CNN on condition of anonymity that the two sides failed to agree on the wording of a cease-fire extension that included the Palestinian demand for Israel to lift the blockade on Gaza.
After the rocket fire Friday, however, Israel's Foreign Ministry said on Twitter that the country "will not conduct negotiations while under fire."
As result, the Palestinian delegation, collectively, decided not to extend the cease fire agreement," said Abu Zuhri.
The message added, "Your statement said that you were disappointed that the parties were unable to agree to an extension of the ceasefire.
On Friday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health issued new casualty numbers for the conflict -- 1,898 deaths, including 446 children, and 9,837 injured.
