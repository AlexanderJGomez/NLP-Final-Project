On Tuesday, North Korea issued new hostile threats, this time to nullify the armistice agreement that ended the Korean War in 1953.
The regime has made threats in the past, but the intensity of its recent belligerence is unusual.
North Korea's history is marred by decades of unimaginable famine.
These are not just numbers and statistics.
The fact is that, even if North Korea's harvests are improved this season, the public food distribution system is still extremely vulnerable to shocks, such as severe weather.
Most importantly, such sideshows are not in the interest of the North Korean people.
Instead, the world needs to focus on the dire situation of the North Korean people and stay committed to finding solutions that will alleviate their hunger and improve their living situations.
