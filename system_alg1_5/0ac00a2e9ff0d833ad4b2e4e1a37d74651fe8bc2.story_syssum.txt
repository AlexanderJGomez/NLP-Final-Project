T.J. Lane, a remorseless killer who escaped from an Ohio prison where he was serving three life sentences for a school shooting, has been captured.
He fired 10 rounds, killing three students.
Lane escaped, along with two other men, about 7:40 p.m. Thursday.
So, everyone in Ohio is shocked right now."
Lane escaped with Clifford E. Opperud, 45, who was serving time for aggravated robbery, and another man.
"We're upset this happened," said Ron Parmetor, whose nephew Daniel Parmetor, 16,  was one of Lane's victims.
But he never offered an explanation.
"For everyone in that courtroom -- the victims, their families, the prosecutors, defense -- everyone in that courtroom was just absolutely taken aback," said Friedman, who hasn't talked to Lane in about a year.
