"We are very sorry for what has happened," said Rhys Holleran, chief executive of Southern Cross Austereo.
The hospital has said that it is also collecting donations from the public for the family and asked that checks be made out to King Edward VII's Hospital -- Jacintha Saldanha Memorial Fund and mailed to Finance, King Edward VII's Hospital, 10 Beaumont Street, London.
Many donations have already been made from around the world, he said, and the hospital would "certainly welcome" a contribution from Southern Cross Austereo.
The call was recorded and then went through a vetting process at their network before it was broadcast, they said.
London's Metropolitan Police have contacted Australian authorities in relation to the call, but "are not discussing about what or with who" they're talking, a spokesman told CNN.
