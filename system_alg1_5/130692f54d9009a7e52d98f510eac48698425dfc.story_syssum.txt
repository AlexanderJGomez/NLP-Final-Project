Rep. Justin Amash, one of the original dozen that opposed Boehner for speaker in 2013, said in a Facebook post that while "Speaker Boehner has given his best to our conference...it's time for Republicans to change our leadership."

Yoho painted his challenge to the establishment leadership as a "vote against the status quo" and a rebuke of Boehner's leadership, which Yoho and his allies have called weak, short-sighted and eschewing regular order in favor of cobbled compromise.
