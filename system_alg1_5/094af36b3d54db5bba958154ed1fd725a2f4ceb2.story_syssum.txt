Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- Tunisia's interim president and prime minister resigned from the ousted leader's ruling party, state TV said Tuesday, a move seen as a gesture to placate angry street demonstrators and keep the unity government afloat.
Another opposition leader, Mustafa Ben Jaafar, was to serve as health minister in the new government but suspended his participation in the united government, his spokesman, Abudallah Tif, told CNN Tuesday.
With their dedication, they have succeeded in reducing the destructive capacity of some areas," he said.
Weeks of demonstrations have left 78 dead and 94 wounded, the government said.

The new government will be tasked with leading Tunisia toward new elections, he said.
Hager Ben Mahmoud, a 34-year-old bid manager at a software company, told CNN that normalcy is creeping back, with banks, shops and grocery stores in Tunis starting to reopen.
In the city of Sfax, Tunisian State TV said, all of the the shops, pharmacies, cafes and most banks are open as usual.
