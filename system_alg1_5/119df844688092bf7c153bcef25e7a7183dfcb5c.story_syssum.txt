"The Central Tibetan Administration urges the international community to not remain passive before the current situation," Lobsang Sangay, the head of the government-in-exile, said in a statement Tuesday.
"We are seriously concerned by reports of violence continuing, heightened tensions in the Tibetan area of China, including reports that security forces in Sichuan Province have been opening fire on protesters, killing some and injuring others," Victoria Nuland, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, said Tuesday.
The reports, which could not be independently verified, contrasted with the account given by the Chinese state news agency.
Then on Tuesday, violence reportedly erupted in Seda County, which Tibetans call Serthar.
For a fifth straight year, China will close Tibet to foreign tourists again this year from the Tibetan New Year festival until the anniversary of a deadly anti-government riot among Tibetans in March, according to regional travel agents.
