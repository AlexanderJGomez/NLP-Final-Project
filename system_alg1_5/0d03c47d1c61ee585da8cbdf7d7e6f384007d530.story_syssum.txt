"Cultured meat would have a lot of advantages," said Jason Matheny of research group New Harvest.
"We could reduce the risks of diseases like swine flu, avian flu, 'mad cow disease', or contamination from Salmonella," he told CNN.
And when we grow only the meat we can eat, it's more efficient.
"We could reduce the environmental footprint of meat, which currently contributes more to global warming than the entire transportation sector," says Matheny.
With concerns about health, animal welfare and the environment growing the appeal of in vitro meat is obvious.
"We think that a technology to produce cultured ground meats -- burgers, sausages, nuggets, and so forth -- could be commercialized within ten years," said Matheny.
"As with most technologies, successive generations should improve in price, quality, and acceptance.
"If cultured meat looks, tastes, and costs the same as regular meat, then I think acceptance will be high.
"What's interesting about the GM issue is that it has been controversial in some places, but is a non-issue for most consumers," he said.
If cultured meat looks, tastes, and costs the same as regular meat, then do we care that it's produced in a steel tank, rather than in an animal farm?
The more we learn about how meat is produced now, the more in-vitro meat looks like a better alternative."
Rather, we should be making it easier and more affordable to raise livestock in a safe, humane and ecologically sensitive manner," she told CNN.
"With India and China doubling their meat consumption every decade, there's no sustainable way to satisfy the growing global appetite for meat without a significant improvement in technology," said Matheny.
