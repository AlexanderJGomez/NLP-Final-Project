Days after being dropped from ESPN's "Monday Night Football," Hank Williams Jr. fired back at that network, "Fox and Friends" and what he called the "United Socialist States of America" in his signature style -- a song bellowing biting lyrics in between guitar licks.
When one of the Fox News' interviewers pointed out that Williams invoked "one of the most hated people in all of the world to describe ... the president," Williams responded: "That is true, but I'm telling you like it is, you know.
Then, last Thursday, ESPN announced that it "decided to part ways" with Williams.
Williams sang that he'd keep his freedom, guns, money, religion and "my Christian name," among other things.
"Ask for my opinion, then twist it all around," Williams sang.
"Because Bocephus and all his rowdy friends -- and his song -- is outta there," he concluded.
