(Financial Times) -- "It's very important that Apple not become the developer for the world," Tim Cook, Apple chief executive, told analysts last month.
Apple seems to be the one more eager for a resolution at present, and not just because of Tim Cook's feelings.
"Samsung has vaulted into first place in worldwide sales of smartphones, with massive sales of its copycat products," alleged a recent Apple filing.
"Samsung's infringement of Apple's intellectual property has already resulted in damages that reach billions of dollars."
Apple's original complaint includes allegations that Samsung infringed on elements of the iPhone's look -- its rectangular shape, rounded corners, silver edges, black face and display of icons.
David Martin, chairman of M-Cam, a US patent analysis company, says there is so much "prior art" -- earlier innovations covering similar ground -- that Apple and Samsung are inviting subsequent third-party litigation by airing the strengths and weaknesses of their patents in public.
"It's critical that its products continue to be able to distinguish themselves with unique features," he says.
