A similar scenario involves Johnson, the former Republican governor of New Mexico, in other states considered too close to call like Colorado, Nevada and New Hampshire, said Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University.
All three states, with a combined 19 electoral votes, are known for independent-minded voters, she noted, enough of whom might be inclined to back a Libertarian instead of Romney.
"In all states CNN has polled so far, the minor party candidates are getting no more than 4% of the vote, and usually closer to 1%-2%," Holland said, noting that including them doesn't change the margin between Obama and Romney.
"If the race is close enough, 100 votes can matter," said Scott Rasmussen, president of the polling company Rasmussen Reports.
If he managed to win, "it would shake up Washington in that an average citizen would be president instead of someone that is backed by super-PACs," he recently told CNN.
However, Johnson's campaign told CNN in September that some of the candidate's support came from former Obama supporters in Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada.
So far, the polling suggests little progress by Johnson in winning over Paul's supporters.
"I think they understood they had to get the people who would definitely vote for Obama to the polls, period, with no wavering and no indecision," she said.
"Minor party supporters usually fall into that category because they don't like the two major party candidates," he said.
