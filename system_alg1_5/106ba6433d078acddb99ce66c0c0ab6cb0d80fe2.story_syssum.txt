(The Hollywood Reporter)Sam Simon, the nine-time Emmy Award-winning comedy writer and producer who helped develop "The Simpsons," made millions after leaving the show in 1993 and then donated his riches to charity, has died, his foundation announced on Facebook.
Most recently, Simon was a consultant on the Charlie Sheen series "Anger Management" and hosted a show on Radioio.com.
"The Simpsons," centering on TV's "first fully self-aware dysfunctional family," as Simon put it, debuted on Fox on December 17, 1989, and is now the longest-running primetime series in American history.
"Sam brought a level of honesty to the characters," Levine said.
"He's hilarious.
If I could make Sam laugh, I was excited."
He was in his mid-30s.
The truth is, I have more money than I'm interested in spending.
Born June 6, 1955, Simon grew up in Beverly Hills in an era when the neighborhood was "quaint," as he put it.
Another time, Elvis Presley returned the dog that Simon had lost.
During his chat with Maron, Simon noted that the way to know when to put down your ailing dog is to "list the three things he loves to do.
So by that criteria, I will never be euthanized."
