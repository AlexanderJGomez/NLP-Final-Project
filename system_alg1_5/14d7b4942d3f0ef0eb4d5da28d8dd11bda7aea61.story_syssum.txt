His boss, President Uhuru Kenyatta, has been indicted on similar charges and is set to appear before the court in The Hague in November.
In her opening statement, the ICC's top prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, said the prosecution would demonstrate that Ruto and his powerful allies sought to exploit the country's tensions for their own political and personal ends.
"Mr. Ruto's ultimate goal was to seize power for himself and his party through violent means," if they failed to do so through the ballot box, she said.
He said there was a "rotten underbelly" to the prosecution's investigation, chiefly conducted under former ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo, which Khan said had failed to recognize the "lying witnesses" directing untrue accusations against his client.
A lawyer for Sang will give his opening statement Wednesday, the court said.
We are the ones who experienced the atrocities the court cites, because there were atrocities, and there was pain and suffering by the victims."
Ruto and myself cannot therefore be away at the same time," he said.
Bensouda has previously said that some of the witnesses, including a few who were set to testify against both leaders, pulled out because of intimidation.
"The ICC is not, under any circumstances, a substitute for domestic criminal justice systems; it only intervenes if the national judicial system is either unwilling or unable to ensure that justice is done," the court said in a statement.
"The government's recent efforts to politicize the ICC trials are deplorable, and must not be allowed to affect the commencement and future proceedings of this landmark trial.
The first phase of Ruto's trial is expected to end on October 4.
