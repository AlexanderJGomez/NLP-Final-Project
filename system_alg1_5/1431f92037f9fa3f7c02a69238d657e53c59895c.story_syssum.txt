Now, Microsoft is facing an undisguised assault from Apple, Google, Samsung Electronics and start-ups like Boxee and Roku.
While surfing through menus, the app frequently makes recommendations about similar films and programs.
"We want you to be able to search and browse in a nonlinear way," Michael Aragon, a vice president for Sony Network Entertainment, said in an interview.
This already works on Sony's Blu-ray players that have the app installed, and will be coming soon to the PlayStation, Aragon said.
The Sony tablet, which is set to debut early next month, will have a version of Video Unlimited, and the iPhone app will eventually include the ability to watch videos offline, he said.
Microsoft, like Sony, feels the heat and continues to push the Xbox beyond gaming.
Microsoft plans to launch new video-on-demand and live TV services for Xbox in partnership with dozens of media companies, he said.
While Sony is optimizing its platform for existing remotes with the unique search feature, Microsoft is promoting the Kinect, with its microphone and camera for motion sensing, as the peripheral for navigating video content.
Sony favors a la carte over "the Netflix model," Aragon said, because it can offer new films close to when they are released on Blu-ray.
"If you want to do subscriptions, you can't have new content," he said.
But if their gaming consoles were truly home-entertainment Trojan horses, the clock is ticking for them to spring their surprise.
