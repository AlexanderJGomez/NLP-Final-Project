Etan Patz, who disappeared in 1979, was the first missing child featured in the milk carton campaigns of the 1980s.
Etan, like any 6-year-old, argued that all of his friends walked to the bus stop alone, and his parents relented.
When no one had seen Etan, she called police and filed a missing person's report.
"In our minds there were only two possibilities," said Stan Patz, the boy's father.
Bronx police questioned Ramos, and he denied having anything to do with Etan's disappearance.
Prosecutors in the Bronx and Manhattan pursued this lead, but concluded they did not have enough evidence to connect Ramos to Etan's disappearance, GraBois and a spokesperson for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said.
"Etan did not have an aunt in Washington Heights,"  GraBois said.
He is scheduled to be released in November 2012, GraBois said.
Etan's case is still considered by the NYPD to be a cold case.
