NASA and SpaceX said the problem was with the Falcon 9 rocket's second stage, rather than the section it plans to try to land.
Engineers called a hold in order to take a closer look," said John Taylor, of SpaceX communications.
SpaceX wants to pioneer a reusable rocket, a development that could change the economics of space travel.
That was according to plan, SpaceX said.
It's not unusual for a launch to be aborted, he said, since there are so many elements at play.
The timing of the next launch attempt will depend on how serious the problem is, he said.
