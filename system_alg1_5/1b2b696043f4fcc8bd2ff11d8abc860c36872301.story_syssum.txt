This is, after all, Wisconsin -- the birthplace of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees and the first state to permit collective bargaining.
Not since Ronald Reagan in 1984 has Wisconsin voted Republican, and in 2008, Obama took the state by a whopping 14 points.
Before Walker's reforms, Wisconsin state employees enjoyed salary and benefits that were about 28% higher than comparable private sector workers, according to a new study from the American Enterprise Institute.
In the end, Democrats have little, if anything, to show for it.
The public sector union machine, once a colossus of Democratic power, looks weak in the wake of Walker's triumph.
With mandatory union dues now extinct, union membership has withered in Wisconsin.
In February 2011, President Obama called Walker's proposals an "assault" on unions.
Local tea party groups, like the Racine tea party, and national groups, such as Americans for Prosperity, have hosted dozens of rallies for Walker, recruiting volunteers from around the country and pouring in campaign donations in unparalleled numbers.
On, Wisconsin!
