(CNN) -- When the Boy Scouts of America found out den leader Jennifer Tyrrell is a lesbian, the organization's Ohio River Valley Council sent her a letter saying "you must immediately sever any relationship you may have" with the Scouts.
But not gay and lesbian leaders.
It's clear the Boy Scouts are lost in the woods.
"Scouting was awesome," he said.
"They're teaching them to be bigots essentially," she said.
I am certainly thankful the Boy Scouts did decide to allow all openly gay kids to be members.
The Scouts shouldn't tell children there's nothing wrong with gay kids, but that there is something mysterious and dangerous about gay and lesbian adults.
Not so much.
That's, of course, impossible.
