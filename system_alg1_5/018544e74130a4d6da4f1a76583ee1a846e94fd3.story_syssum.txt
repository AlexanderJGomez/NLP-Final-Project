The victim, who testified at trial, is now 17, it said.
Joel Engelman, an advocate against sexual abuse among Orthodox Jews who described himself as a survivor of such abuse, said it is rare for respected members of the community to face such allegations in court.
George Farkas, Weberman's attorney, was not available for comment.
Sentencing is set for January 9.
