I'm not mad at Tiger Woods, or Nike.
It's an in-your-face, unapologetic statement.
Well, now Tiger is being real.
And I say, good for him.
Don't be mad at Tiger.
Or, be mad at yourself.
In those worlds you are only as good as your last big win.
Winning does change things.
Because he knows how to win.
Tiger got back up.
