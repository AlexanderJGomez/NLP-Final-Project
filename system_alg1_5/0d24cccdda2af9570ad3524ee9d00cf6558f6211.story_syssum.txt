(CNN) -- With its luminous body seemingly hovering above the water, and five spidery legs plunging deep into the sea, this futuristic building could be the mothership in a sci-fi film.
"There are many people who will never have the courage to dive to these beautiful reefs," designer, Pawel Podwojewski, told CNN.
Those wanting to explore the spectacular underwater world, can also dive straight in from the hotel's airlock compartment, including its own decompression chamber.
"If you need to replace a window for example, it's very difficult underwater," explained Podwojewski.
There are also plans to rebuild coral reefs, by growing the vibrant eco-systems in a special plantation before relocating them around the hotel.
But it seems this unique underwater hotel will be much closer than you think.
