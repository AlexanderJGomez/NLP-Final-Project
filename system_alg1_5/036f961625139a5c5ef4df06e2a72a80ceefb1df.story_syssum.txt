I know eco-sensitive burial methods are increasingly popular with humans, but I wasn't sure about pets, so I checked it out.
Although cremation, in the end, is greener than traditional $4,000 metal casket-in-the-ground burials, it isn't without environmental minuses, specifically in terms of energy use and emissions.
There is a natural pet burial movement, although it's a relatively small one.
Not to be a Donald Downer, but if you have the chance, I'd also check out this story about pet estate planning (yes, estate planning ... there's quite a few wealthy animal heirs out there) and grieving.
