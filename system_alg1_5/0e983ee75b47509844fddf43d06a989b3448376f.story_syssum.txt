Los Angeles (CNN) -- Cast members of the hit television show "Happy Days," who are suing CBS, accused the company of "despicable conduct" for not paying them for merchandising revenues.
"This is one of the most heavily merchandised shows ever," Most said.
"People loved 'Happy Days,' and it's been on everything from bedsheets to lunch boxes."
Instead, it said the actors "were simply ignorant of, or slept upon their own rights.
The actors said CBS claimed it did not pay them for the "Happy Days" slot machine proceeds due "to oversight."
In addition, from 2008 to January 2011, CBS issued news releases announcing licensing agreements with 14 companies that include gift items, clothing, glassware and bar accessories, the court filing said.
I'm hoping this case gives visibility to not only help us, but to help thousands of other individuals in the entertainment business."
