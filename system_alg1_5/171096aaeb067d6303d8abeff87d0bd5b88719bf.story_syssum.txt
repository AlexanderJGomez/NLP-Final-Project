(CNN) -- Formula One's 12 teams have struck an agreement to secure the future of the sport until 2020, Bernie Ecclestone has exclusively told CNN.
The Concorde Agreement is between Formula One's governing body, the FIA, the sport's rights holders and the Formula One Teams Association (FOTA).
"I appreciate and support Mercedes probably more than anyone in F1," said Ecclestone.
"The market doesn't look too bright after that little bit of a problem with Facebook," said Ecclestone, referring to the social networking website's recent public offering.
