Cesar Gaviria highlighted the problems Mexico is facing handling its drug problem.
"What you need to do with addicts and people who consume drugs is deal with them as a health problem, an education problem," he said.
"The Mexicans probably in a few years will be able to deal a little better with the problems of security," he said.
"But the flow of drugs will keep growing."
