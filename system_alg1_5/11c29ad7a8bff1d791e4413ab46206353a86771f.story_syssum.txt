Age: 16 when she was reported missing; now, 27.
"Grandma, I'm fine," Berry said, according to a call recorded by CNN affiliate WJHL.
Age: 14 when she was reported missing; now, 23.

A sister, Mayra DeJesus, said Gina spent Tuesday with her family -- with the focus on her, but not so much what she'd gone through.

Barbara Knight moved to Naples, Florida, about a year and a half ago, her neighbor Sheldon Gofberg told CNN.
