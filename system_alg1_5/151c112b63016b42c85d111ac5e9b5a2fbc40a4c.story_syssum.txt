Dalelv, who had been working at an interior design firm in Qatar since September 2011, told CNN on Saturday how a work trip to Dubai in March with three colleagues turned into a nightmare.
"He dragged me by my purse in, so I thought, 'OK, I just need to calm the situation down.
That is what you do.
We are trained on that from when we are very young," she said.
Her belongings were taken and she was kept in jail for four days, she said, with no explanation as to why.
A piece of paper with Arabic text was handed to her, she said.
It was the first time she was made aware that she faced charges, Dalelv said.
Dalelv said a month after the rape, while forced to stay in Dubai as the case wound through the legal system, she was fired.
"Only when Ms. Dalelv declined to have positive and constructive discussions about her employment status, and ceased communication with her employer, was the company forced to end our relationship with her," the statement said.
As a rule, CNN does not identify victims of sexual assault, but Dalelv went public with her story.
Norwegian Foreign Affairs Minister Espen Barth Eide called his UAE counterpart, Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed al-Nahyan, on Friday night to protest Dalelv's sentencing, a statement from the Norwegian ministry said.
In December 2012, a British woman reported being raped by three men in Dubai.
She was convicted of having sex outside marriage and drinking alcohol, and she was sentenced to 11 months in prison.
