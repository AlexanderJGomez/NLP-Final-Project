This year's show is dedicated to Jackson.
BET has already paid tribute to the singer, going wall-to-wall with Jackson videos Thursday night.
BET CEO Lee said Sunday's show will be dedicated to Jackson and will also pay tribute to his legacy.
"Michael's influence is felt every day in so many ways at BET Networks, and it's been that way throughout our network's entire 29-year history," she said.
