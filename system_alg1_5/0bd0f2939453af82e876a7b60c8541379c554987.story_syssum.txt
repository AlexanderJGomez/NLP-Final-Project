(CNN) -- TV's newest crime thriller, "The Bridge," is taking viewers to a volatile place most have only seen on the news: The U.S.-Mexican border.
Filmmaker Gerardo Naranjo, known for his critically-acclaimed drug trafficking film "Miss Bala," directed the pilot episode and told CNN the drama's authentic take on the U.S.-Mexican border is what sets it apart from other productions.
"We tried to be as honest as possible," Naranjo said.
"It is not about making Mexico look good or bad, it is about what is the truth.
"When we first starting thinking about the show, we knew we had a huge potential opportunity with the Hispanic audience," Sally Daws, FX's senior vice president of marketing, told CNN.
'The Bridge' is a great bet," Naranjo said to CNN.
"The Bridge" premieres July 10 PM ET on FX.
