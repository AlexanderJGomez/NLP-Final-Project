"He was just everything," said T.J. Jackson, who shares guardianship of Michael Jackson's children -- Prince, Paris and Blanket -- with their grandmother.

"My mother was murdered for money, too, so I don't put that past anyone," he said.
"She was daddy's girl," he said.
Blanket, who was 7 when his father died, "was always wrapped around his leg, very shy," T.J. Jackson said.
He's missed sharing with his father "the first day of going to school, having the first girlfriend, being able to drive," Prince testified.
"He's very strong, he's very smart," he testified.
"It's, just to be frank, a complete annoyance," he said.
