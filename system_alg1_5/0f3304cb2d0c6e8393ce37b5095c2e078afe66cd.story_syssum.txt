It's hard to find Feinberg's 1993 classic novel, "Stone Butch Blues," today.
Feinberg died at home in Syracuse, New York, from complications from several infections, her spouse of 22 years, Minnie Bruce Pratt, told The Advocate.
I didn't "look" gay so I could hide, as I had through my teen years and most of my undergraduate education.
I could quietly enjoy the benefits of the work done by Feinberg and other transgender activists, butch women, gay men and drag queens who could not or would not fade into the shadows.
Gay rights, transgender rights, workers' rights, any rights: They did not exist in a vacuum to Feinberg.
"It was the real-life struggle for justice, particularly economic justice that was Feinberg's life work and passion," Fried wrote to me.
That was Feinberg's gift to me, and to you.
