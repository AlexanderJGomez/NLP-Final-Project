The new issue of AQAP's Inspire magazine, released on December 24, featured instructions on how to build what AQAP called a "hidden bomb" from easily purchasable materials.
On Christmas Day 2009, Omar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the so-called "underwear bomber," attempted to detonate an explosive device built by Ibrahim al Asiri, AQAP's master bomb-maker, on a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit.
In the new issue, AQAP suggested its external operation division had greenlighted sharing the recipe because al Asiri and his team had developed a new generation of more sophisticated devices.
The authors of the latest issue of Inspire magazine claimed that if enough lone wolves launch attempts with their suggested device, some would get through.
The key aim, the group stated, was to undermine the American economy.
We judge that it significantly enhanced the capability of individuals in four of these 10 attack plots."
