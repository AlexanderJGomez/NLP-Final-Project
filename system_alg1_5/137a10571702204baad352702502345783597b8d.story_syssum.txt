An Iran armed with nuclear weapons, capable of threatening Israel and other regional states, would touch off a nuclear arms race in the world's most volatile region.
For this reason, I have pressed for ever-tightening sanctions to isolate Iran from the global economy and have supported a policy that leaves all options on the table, including military force.
I disagree.
If it is not, there will be ample opportunity to tighten the stranglehold on Iran's economy, and further sanctions will have my full support.
I have no illusions about the character of the Iranian regime, nor do I trust it.
Ultimately, this is not about trust.
And if we cannot, no doubt will remain that the United States made every effort to resolve this grave threat diplomatically.
