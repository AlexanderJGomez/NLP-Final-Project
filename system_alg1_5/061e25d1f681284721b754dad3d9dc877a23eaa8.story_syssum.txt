More than just a daily habit, Facebook has become the place where I get important, often surprising glimpses into the lives of the 1,365 people with whom I've chosen to connect.
I'm not always in love with Facebook, of course.
But, in large part, the people who say they're leaving Facebook don't.
There's critical mass, and then there's Facebook, the Death Star that deflects every effort to blow it up.
MySpace, even at its peak, never had the mainstream acceptance and durability of Facebook.
That's what Facebook wants, of course.
When Facebook recently bought photo-sharing app Instagram for $1 billion, Instagram users vowed to quit, complaining that their precious little network had sold out to a monolithic company.
And Diaspora, the open-source, nonprofit that was supposed to threaten Facebook's laissez-faire attitude toward privacy, has yet to crack half a million users.
Even then, he stressed that the future of Facebook was not as a website or tool, but as a global communication platform upon which other things would be built.
Until then, I'm not leaving.
