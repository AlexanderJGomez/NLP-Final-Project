Arsenic in apple juice.
The researchers found about 10% of the samples had arsenic levels higher than 10 parts per billion.
The FDA describes organic, or naturally-occurring arsenic as "essentially harmless."
"Apple juice producers, as well as the FDA, want people to know they can be confident that apple juice is safe," Rick Cristol, president of the Juice Products Association, said in a statement, noting that juice companies routinely test their products.
Scientists also know that arsenic can affect the nervous system, causing headaches, numbness and tremors, and can damage your blood vessels.
Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports, has advocated since then for a 3 parts per billion limit but said in a statement that it is happy with the FDA's "reasonable first step."
The FDA has to accept public comments on their proposal for 60 days before these recommendations can be implemented.
