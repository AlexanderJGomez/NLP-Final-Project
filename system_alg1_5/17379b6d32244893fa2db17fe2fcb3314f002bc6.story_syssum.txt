(CNN) -- Argentina's Congress debated a broadcast reform bill Wednesday, a proposal analysts say is the latest blow in a fight between President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and media conglomerate Grupo Clarin.
This bill is "for everyone who wants to live in a more democratic and more pluralistic Argentina," Fernandez de Kirchner said in a speech last month.
"At this moment, in Nicaragua, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador and Argentina, the presidents have conflicts with the private media and seek to dominate them, although each country is a different case," Fraga said.
"It hits other media groups, but Clarin is the one it hurts," said Daniel Kerner, an analyst at Eurasia Group.
If anyone is applying unfair pressure, it is monopolistic media companies, Fernandez de Kirchner said.
In response, Fernandez de Kirchner has come out swinging at the Clarin newspaper and its parent company, observers said.
The Kirchners "have a hostile stance, not just against Clarin but against all the press," he said.
It's paradoxical."
