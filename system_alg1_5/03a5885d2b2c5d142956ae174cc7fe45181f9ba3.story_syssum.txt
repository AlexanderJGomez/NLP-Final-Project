It has provided an ideal case study for disaster relief, and an Oxfam report, published today, examines the lessons that have been learned, as well as areas that the humanitarian relief sector still needs to improve upon.
The hardest-hit countries -- Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand -- were among the poorest, and the disaster only compounded the developmental and societal issues those nations were already facing.
"All the things that come together to ensure that people do connect were all there -- it was a natural disaster (as opposed to a man-made humanitarian crisis), it was enormous, completely unexpected," she said.
Pooled funds, Cocking says, allow agencies like Oxfam to use donations for humanitarian crises which are equally important, but perhaps not as high impact.
The tsunami was one of the first disasters to be extensively captured on camera, and the extent of media coverage makes a sizable difference to the public -- and governments -- opening their wallets, Oxfam says.
The charity says that, in the aftermath of the tsunami, it learned a great deal about inequalities exacerbated by the onset of natural disasters.
Recruiting more female relief workers, especially at the coordination level, providing safe shelter and toilet facilities for women, and "prioritizing livelihood activities for women as well as men," can reduce this disparity, the report recommends.
