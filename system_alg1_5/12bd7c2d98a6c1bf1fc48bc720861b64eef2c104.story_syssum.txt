And like Alice in Wonderland, the "right size" for tablets keeps shifting.
Meanwhile, users of the Kindle Fire or Nook Color often prize having a tablet that slips easily into a pocket or purse for half the price (or less) of an iPad.
Rumors have long been swirling that Apple might be preparing to launch an "iPad mini" model that's closer in size to the Kindle Fire.
Of course, before we learn the truth of the elusive mythical iPad mini, the next version of the Kindle Fire, which could be released as soon as May or June, might feature a model with a larger screen as well as upgraded specifications.
Certainly, Apple has noticed this development even if, as usual, they won't talk about it.
Apple might decide to take the "small is beautiful" approach and market an iPad mini as providing extra, or at least different, value -- not as a compromise.
"I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind," said Alice.
