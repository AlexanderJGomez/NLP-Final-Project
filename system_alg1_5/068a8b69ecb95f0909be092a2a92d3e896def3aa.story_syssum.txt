"You accept the fact that you're playing the way you feel," Federer told reporters.
That's very encouraging, I must say."
"Definitely one of the top three matches in my life," said Monfils, who squandered two match points against Federer at the U.S. Open.
Wawrinka, meanwhile, sparkled against French No.
"I know how to play those matches," Wawrinka said.
He showed no after effects of the loss to Federer, when he blew four match points and was reportedly taunted by Federer's wife, Mirka.
The outstretched arms of Clement at precisely the same time suggested an expression of, 'It's about time,' and the Swiss cow bells were temporarily silenced.
"Stan, for example, announced that the ball was out, and it was in.
"Now I'm coming out of the match without any pain, which is good, too," said Federer.
If I play the doubles and the singles, it needs to be a lot better than today.
Wawrinka and Federer both aren't scheduled to play doubles but they can be called upon Saturday.
