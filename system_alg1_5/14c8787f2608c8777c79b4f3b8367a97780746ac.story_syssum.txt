The allegations stem from passages in Dunham's collection of personal essays, "Not That Kind of Girl," in which she describes sexually experimenting with her younger sister as a child.
Dunham, creator and star of the popular HBO show "Girls," said she was "dismayed" over the interpretation of events described in her book.
Messages sent to Random House, Dunham's publisher, and her publicist were not immediately returned.
Dunham's sister, Grace Dunham, did not respond to requests for comment.
