In explaining his decision, Chief Judge Alex Kozinski of the federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals chided the prosecution for remaining "unconstitutionally silent" on the "history of misconduct" of its key witness, a Phoenix police detective.
That was the plan, she said, when the boy got into the car with Milke's roommate, James Styers.
In fact, "no other witnesses or direct evidence (linked) Milke to the crime" other than Saldate's testimony.
"The trial was, essentially, a swearing contest between Milke and ... Saldate," said Kozinski.
"The judge and jury believed Saldate," said Kozinski of the verdict and sentence.
"In the balance hangs the life of Milke," Kozinski said, explaining the importance of his decision to overturn her convictions.
