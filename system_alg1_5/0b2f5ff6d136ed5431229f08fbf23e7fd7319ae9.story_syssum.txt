(CNN) -- A 23-year-old exchange student, attacked in her Toronto apartment while a friend in China watched via computer webcam, was found dead there hours later, police say.
Ten hours later, police arrived at the basement apartment to find Liu's body, naked from the waist down.
With no suspects and no one in custody, police have been questioning neighbors, CTV reported.
The friend was looking away when he heard a shot and a scream, police said.
Upon looking back at the screen, the friend saw Hain's husband firing a handgun at where his wife had been, they said.
