The militants were shouting, "God is great," as they stalked through the auditorium, according to Ahmed.
"My shoulder was peeking out of the bench, and somebody was following," Ahmed recalled.
Shahrukh Khan, 16, was also in the auditorium.
"The man with big boots kept on looking for students and pumping bullets into their bodies," he told AFP.
"I lay as still as I could and closed my eyes, waiting to get shot again."
"I realized it was an attack," he told CNN.
"Some children got up and then they were shot, after which the attackers left the room," he said.
"The men entered into the rooms one by one and started indiscriminately firing at the staff member and students," he told AFP.
"My son was my dream," Ali told The Associated Press.
"My dream has been killed."
She was throwing herself against an ambulance at the Lady Reading Hospital, AFP said, one of many inconsolable parents.
