Separately, an Afghan soldier killed four French soldiers and injured 15 others, one critically, in eastern Afghanistan, French officials said.
"The French army is not in Afghanistan to be shot at by Afghan soldiers," he said.
The official, who was not authorized to speak to the media, said 15 soldiers were injured.
"France has been generous to provide extensive assistance to Afghanistan over the past 10 years," Karzai said.
"Such tragic incidents are terrible and grab headlines, but they are isolated," he said.
In October, a gunman wearing an Afghan army uniform turned his weapon on coalition forces during training, killing three and wounding several others.
Meanwhile, the cause of the helicopter crash, which happened around midnight Kabul time, is still under investigation, ISAF said.
