That pits the new device, which will ship in late November, against a device with which Apple has, thus far, squashed all direct competition.
For $499, the cost of the lowest-end iPad (the 16GB, WiFi-only model), a buyer can get a 32GB version of the Fire HD with a 4G LTE connection on an upgraded cellular network.
Apple's iPad screen measures 9.7 inches diagonally, while the Fire is at 8.9 inches.
Until now, the Kindle Fire has been a WiFi-only device, and some of its new models remain that way.
The $50 is well under what AT&T and Verizon charge for a year of data on the iPad.
When the first iPad launched, AT&T offered data plans starting at $15 per month, or $180 per year, for 250 megabytes of data.
It's safe to say Amazon's is going to be less expensive, although it offers a minimal amount of data.
Bezos lumped together more than 22 million movies, TV shows, songs, apps, games, books, audiobooks and magazines available from Amazon's store.
