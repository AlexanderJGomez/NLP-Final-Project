For many on the outside, there seemed little amiss in the lives of Ferrante and Klein.
Then, on April 17, 2013, Ferrante called 911 and said his wife was "conscious and breathing, but not alert" inside their Pittsburgh home.
"Please, please, please," he said.
At the time the order was placed, there were no active projects at Ferrante's lab that involved the use of cyanide, according to the complaint.
In July 2013, Ferrante was charged in his late wife's death, arrested in West Virginia, then extradited back to Pennsylvania.
"Further, evidence has been uncovered that reflects that the victim intended to have a conversation with Ferrante and Ferrante would 'not like the discussion,'" the complaint adds.
His lawyer, Bill Difenderfer, said after the verdict that he thought his client "did extremely well" on the stand.
"I think he has excellent coaches," Ewing said.
