Guido Bertolaso, the head of the Italian Civil Protection Department said that there is a 20 to 30 percent chance the river could break its banks and cause disruption in some neighborhoods in northern Rome, but not in the historic city center.
"If there will be no more rain, the situation is expected to stabilize," he said.
Because of the intense rain, the streets of some northern Rome neighborhoods were already flooded by water and covered in thick brown mud.
One woman died near Rome early Thursday when her car was submerged by a wave of water and mud in an underpass.
