CNN's Larry King talked Wednesday with Michael Moore, a filmmaker with deep ties to the auto industry.
Michael Moore: When I made that film, there were still 50,000 people working at General Motors in Flint.
So, their attitude was we'll build it and you buy it.
You just buy it.
Now, here we are on the verge of this collapse.
I'll tell you, it was hilarious just watching these CEOs there (Tuesday) and (Wednesday) testifying in Congress, saying that, you know, that the problem wasn't theirs, you know, the cars they were building.
I'll tell you, you know, I'm of mixed mind about this bailout, Larry, because I don't think these companies, with these management people, should be given a dime, because  that's just going to be money going up in smoke or off to other countries.
When Roosevelt came in and when World War II faced the country, Roosevelt said to General Motors and Ford, you're not going to build cars anymore.
Moore: President-Elect Obama has to say to them, yes, we're going to use this money to save these jobs, but we're not going to build these gas-guzzling, unsafe vehicles any longer.
We're going to run out of that, if not in our children's time, our grandchildren's time.
