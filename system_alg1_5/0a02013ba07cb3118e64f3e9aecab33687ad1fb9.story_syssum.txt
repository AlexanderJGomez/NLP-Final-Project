Then there's a good Christmas story.
In 1843, Charles Dickens gave us "A Christmas Carol."
Then there's one that the marketers made sure really goes for the heart -- "I'll Be Home for Christmas" -- and the line, "if only in my dreams."
(Even if we never really liked her -- but then, it's Christmas.)
Dinah Shore and Buddy Clark doing "Baby, it's Cold Outside."
Of course, Christmas is children.
And how about "I Want A Hippopotamus For Christmas," by Gayla Peevey?
Absolutely not.
The security of home, family and friends is essential.
Yes, of course, to all those questions.
Happy holidays, cousins.
