Britain's Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is going back to work, taking on a new role as an air ambulance pilot.
"The Duke sees this as a true form of public service, helping people in their most difficult times," the spokesman said.
Public interest could  affect not only his work, but potentially also that of medics and patients on board his aircraft.
William is currently on what officials have described as a "transitional year," focusing on his royal duties and charitable work.
William will spend the autumn and winter in training with the East Anglian Air Ambulance and, once qualified, will start co-piloting in the spring of next year.
The palace said the pilot role would be the Duke's "primary occupation."
The Cambridges' country house, Anmer Hall, is being renovated and is set in idyllic rural surroundings which affords the family more privacy than their official residence at Kensington Palace, London, which is constantly monitored by photographers.
