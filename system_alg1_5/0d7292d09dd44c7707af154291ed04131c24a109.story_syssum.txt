Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- As the bodies of eight tourists killed in a bus hijacking in the Philippines arrived in Hong Kong, China, on Wednesday, the Hong Kong government urged citizens not to take their grief and anger out on Filipinos despite "the poor way" the hijacking was handled by authorities.
"The truth is the best consolation for the victims and their families," he said.
"The EOC urges all members of the community to stay calm and, in line with our good tradition of tolerance and understanding, refrain from shifting our anger towards an innocent group, particularly the Filipinos who are living and traveling in Hong Kong," the statement said.
Rodolfo Matibay, district director of Manila police, took responsibility for how the incident was handled, saying he ordered the police assault on the bus, according to Gen. Leocaldo Santiago, regional director of Manila police.
Santiago said police killed none of  the hostages, though a ballistics investigation has yet to be completed.
The Chinese territory, meanwhile, issued a black travel alert for the Philippines, advising residents to avoid all travel there.
"Jessie was a helpful girl -- cheerful, lovely, a good academic," said Catherine Chan, the school's development manager.
The deadly standoff unfolded live on television, which the gunman was able to watch on a monitor on the bus.
said Richard Gordon, chairman of the Philippine National Red Cross.
He said that he was probably going to die, but not the hostages," he said.
"When he saw his brother getting accosted by the policemen, he went berserk and he started firing," he said.
