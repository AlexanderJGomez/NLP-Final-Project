ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Taliban militants made their deepest incursion into Pakistan this week, seizing control of areas that are a short drive from the capital city.
Those warheads, however, are unassembled and scattered about Pakistan in areas that are not under the control of the Taliban, several analysts said.
"But, no, we do not have a situation in which the government or the country of Pakistan is about to fall to the Taliban."
"The threat to nuclear weapons is not so imminent because they are far away from those places and secondly, they are under control of the army," Rizvi said.
"It's a source of power," Rizvi said.
At the briefing, Lt. Gen. Khalid Kidwai -- head of the army division that controls Pakistan's nuclear sites and weapons -- said the country's weapons were protected by a "fool-proof" security system.
