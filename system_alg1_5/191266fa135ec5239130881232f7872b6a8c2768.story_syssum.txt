Ferrari's Alonso holds an eight-point lead over second-placed Webber, with Vettel in third 15 points off the top.
"I don't think I would lose even one second of my energy this weekend thinking of what is going to happen on Sunday afternoon," the 29-year-old told F1's official website when asked whether he would understand if Vettel assisted Webber.
"If the situation occurs then I think we know that we're driving for the team," the German said.
That's what we plan to do."
