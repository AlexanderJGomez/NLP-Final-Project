And they evoke violent sectarian rivalries in Iraq and Pakistan, where animosity between Sunni and Shia runs deep.
A man identifying himself as a spokesman for Lashkar-e-Janghvi al Almi, a group with links to al Qaeda and the Pakistan Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack in a call to Radio Mashaal, a Pashto-language station in Pakistan sponsored by the United States government.
The Hazara are numerous in both Pakistan and Afghanistan, and make up much of Afghanistan's Shia minority.
In October, Sunni militants killed dozens more Hazara.
Kate Clark says that while she is circumspect about the Taliban's denial, such an attack would be at odds with the Taliban leadership's claim to be a national movement -- and is not part of a pattern of such attacks by the group.
The Taliban are not a monolith, as one Afghan observer puts it, and it is possible that at local level there may have been collaboration between a Taliban operative and LeJ.
Since the overthrow of the Taliban, Afghanistan's Hazara have prospered -- in higher education, the government and the military and they have embraced new democratic processes.
On all sides, Clark says, there is a realization that sectarian conflict is a no-win situation in which tit-for-tat attacks would claim hundreds of lives.
