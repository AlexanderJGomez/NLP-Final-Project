"While this incident remains the subject of an ongoing death investigation, there are no signs of foul play," the sheriff's statement said.
A SeaWorld employee, who asked not to be identified, described the incident the same way.
In 1999, Tilikum was blamed for the death of a 27-year-old man whose body was found floating in a tank at SeaWorld, the apparent victim of a whale's "horseplay," authorities said then.
Specific procedures were in place for working with him, he said, although "obviously, we need to evaluate those protocols."
Such whales play with seals and sea lions in the wild, tossing them in the air, she said.
But, she said, the whale could also have been frustrated for some reason.
She said Tilikum had a "flopped fin," something seen in captivity but not much in the wild.
"This is the first time in 46 years that we've ever had an incident like this with a trainer," he said.
