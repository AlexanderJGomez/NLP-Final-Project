Prince Charles' office at Clarence House released its annual review Friday, shedding light on how money is spent on the couple, as well as Princes William and Harry and, of course, the newest addition to the family, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.
In the 2011-12 fiscal year, the prince's private income from the duchy rose by 3% to slightly more than $28.5 million.
What we do know, though, is that Prince Charles pays for his daughter-in-law's outfits for official engagements out of his private income.
As it happens, 90% of it is his (Prince Charles') own income, so it's not coming from central government coffers."
Riding high on that wave is the household of the Prince of Wales, as exemplified by the 76,825 letters received from the public in 2011-12.
