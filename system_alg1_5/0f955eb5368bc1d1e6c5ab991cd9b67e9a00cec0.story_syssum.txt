Igor Plotnitsky, leader of the self-declared separatist republic in eastern Ukraine's Luhansk region, said he challenges Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to a one-on-one fight to end the monthslong conflict.
"Fulfill the Minsk agreement if you want peace," Yatsenyuk said, according to state-run media outlet Ukrinfom.
"In order to guarantee reaching peace we need to negotiate in a format accepted by the whole world and, first of all, suitable for Ukraine," Yatsenyuk said.
Just last week, U.S. Gen. Philip Breedlove, the commander of NATO forces in Europe, said that his government has seen Russian tanks, artillery, air defense systems and troops heading into Ukraine.
Unrest in Ukraine began with protests in the country's capital last year after pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych, favoring closer ties to Russia, dropped plans to sign a political and economic agreement with the European Union.
