Today, Jawbone CEO Hosain Rahman issued a statement on Jawbone's website explaining the cause of the failures, and offered a comprehensive, perhaps unprecedented, refund program for anyone unhappy with his or her purchase.
We're also fixing an issue with syncing related to the band hardware.
Well, that's how the UP system operates when working.
In his statement, Rahman says that Jawbone has "temporarily paused production" of the bands, and will once again begin taking orders after the hardware's technical issues have been resolved.
In fact, someone can collect a full refund, as well as receive a replacement band as long as the band qualifies under warranty.
