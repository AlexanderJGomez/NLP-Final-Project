The Justice Department will issue the new guidelines that will prohibit profiling based on religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation and gender identity, a Justice official said.
He ran into opposition along the way, including from the FBI, whose agents feared it would make their work more difficult, and more recently from the Homeland Security Department, which sought more flexibility for its agencies before agreeing to join the new policy.

The group Muslim Advocates also argued the new rules don't go far enough in protecting American Muslims from profiling by the FBI, Customs and Border Protection, and other law enforcement agencies.
