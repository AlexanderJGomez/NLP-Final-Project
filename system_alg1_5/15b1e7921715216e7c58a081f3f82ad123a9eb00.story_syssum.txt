The exhibit, called "Ciudad Juarez es the .1," is the work of local artist Abel Saucedo, 24, a recent arts graduate of the University of Texas in El Paso.
I decided to use a pi√±ata because it's a way to identify with my culture," Saucedo said in a phone interview.
"They don't represent anyone in particular, just the violence in the border," Saucedo said.
In art I've learned that everything everyone says, it's an opinion," said Saucedo.
"As a person living here in the community, as an artist, this is my opportunity to speak, and it's tragic.
"Ciudad Juarez es the .1" will run until July 31.
