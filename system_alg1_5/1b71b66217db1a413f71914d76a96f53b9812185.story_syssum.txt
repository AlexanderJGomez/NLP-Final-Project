ISIS carried out those killings, and Jordan carried out al-Rishawi's execution.
The online posts, which CNN could not verify independently, appeared four days after an ISIS video demanded that the Japanese government pay $200 million within 72 hours for the hostages' release.
"They are just demanding the release of their imprisoned sister Sajida al-Rishawi," the voice said.
"My husband detonated his bomb, and I tried to detonate mine but failed," al-Rishawi said on Jordanian television, showing no emotion.
Jordanian authorities said al-Rishawi, now in her 40s, joined her husband, Hussein Ali al-Shamari, to carry out the suicide bombings at the Radisson hotel.
Deputy Prime Minister Marwan Muasher said after the attacks that al-Rishawi was the sister of Zarqawi's "right-hand man," who was killed in Falluja, Iraq.
"There's a link back to this woman," Reese said of the alleged prisoner swap.
After the Jordan attacks, Muasher told CNN that al-Rishawi was not wearing an explosives belt when she was apprehended, but two belts were found with her.
"There was a wedding ceremony in the hotel," she said.
