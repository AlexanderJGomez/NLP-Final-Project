The statement also claimed the group is responsible for the crash of a UPS cargo plane in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on September 3.
Explosions have distinctive sound signatures, and that would have been recorded on the device, the official said.
U.S. investigators believe that al Qaeda bombmaker Ibrahim Hasan al-Asiri, 28, is linked to the packages, according to a federal official who was briefed by authorities.
After last week's incidents, U.S. government authorities grounded packages originating from Yemen destined for the United States.
