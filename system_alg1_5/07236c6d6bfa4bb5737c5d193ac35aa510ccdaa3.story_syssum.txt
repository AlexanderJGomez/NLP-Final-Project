Billings, Montana (CNN) -- His lenient sentence and the judge's comments about his victim sparked national outrage and protests.
"(Judge G. Todd Baugh) made a mistake and I'm disappointed, (31) days, that's outrageous, but the Montana Supreme Court stepped in.
"If we can't get him removed from this, there is something wrong with the system, and I know people in the state will work to not get (Baugh) re-elected (next year)," said Marian Bradley, president of Montana NOW.
"I never saw him until we were in a courtroom all those years," she said.
With Cherice's death, the prosecution entered into what is known as a "deferred prosecution agreement" with Rambold.
"He made some violations of his treatment program," the judge said.
"I think we just get used to it, so we don't cry every day," she said, but the tears still came.
