(CNN)  -- Judging by the hysterical reaction in some quarters, to President Obama's handshake with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, or his bow to Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah, you would think that America's national security rested solely on body language not sound policy.
He also has  stated over and over again that "America does not torture," thus returning the United States to leading on human rights, not cherry-picking them.
"Let me say this as plainly as I can: By August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end," he announced.
"If the Afghanistan government falls to the Taliban or allows al-Qaeda to go unchallenged," Obama said in March, "that country will again be a base for terrorists."
As Obama himself recognizes, "There will be no lasting peace unless we expand spheres of opportunity for the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan."
On May 6 and 7, Obama will be meeting in Washington with the presidents of Pakistan and Afghanistan.
After 30 years of enmity, President Obama offered Iran "the promise of a new beginning" in a Persian New Year video message, and since then has clearly signaled the United States was over regime-change.
Meantime, Obama has named a new Middle East Peace envoy, former Sen. George Mitchell, signaling he wants to take negotiations out of the deep freeze and committing to the two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians.
Last week, Obama told Jordan's King Hussein at the White House, "My hope would be that over the next several months you start seeing gestures of good faith on all sides."
With all this activity, Obama is clearly shifting the United States away from the "isolate and punish" policy of his predecessor.
