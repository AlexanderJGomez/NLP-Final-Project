This is one of the rooms where Pakistan's media war is being fought, and Abbas, the Pakistan army's main spokesman, is a key part of the battle.
In fact, I rather get the impression Abbas, who has become the face of the army's operation against Taliban militants in the Swat Valley, watches our coverage closely.
I ask if that includes NATO weapons, as suggested in recent reports, and he agrees.
When I ask what that means, he smiles and says he can't elaborate -- declining to repeat the speculation in the press here that India, Pakistan's traditional rival, may be somehow involved in stirring up trouble on Pakistan's northwestern border.
"First you have to disarm the Taliban and then re-establish the writ of government," he says.
Now, he says, the army is set for a long fight.
"It's a very big issue -- a serious concern," Abbas says.
And he seems acutely aware that the portrayal of that conflict to the West will be critical.
