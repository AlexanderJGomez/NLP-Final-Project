The patient, an American health care provider who had been working in Saudi Arabia, is not on oxygen and is eating well and walking around, said doctors in Munster, Indiana.
The patient, whose name has not been disclosed due to federal privacy standards, was working at a hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
"There was a possible thought initially that it was pneumonia," or some other kind of respiratory virus, Kumar said.
Between that monitoring and video surveillance, the hospital was able to track the patient's entire journey through the hospital system, according to Kumar.
Scientists do not know exactly how MERS spreads, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but they don't believe it spreads through casual contact.
The patient was not symptomatic at the time of travel, according to the doctors.
Of those, 93 people died.
"MERS picked the wrong hospital, the wrong state, the wrong country to try to get a foothold," said Dr. William VanNess, Indiana state health commissioner.
