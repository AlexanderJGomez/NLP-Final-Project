He's collaborated with bluegrass musicians, jazz players, classical performers and any number of other talented artists.
Earlier this year, he released the documentary "Throw Down Your Heart," for which he traveled to Uganda, Tanzania, Mali, and Gambia to explore the African roots of the banjo.
Fleck: That's a common question.
Fleck: Sure.

Fleck: My reasons for going to Africa were kind of selfish, because I love the banjo, and I really want to play with the musicians.

It's not a political statement, but it does point out what is beautiful about Africans.
