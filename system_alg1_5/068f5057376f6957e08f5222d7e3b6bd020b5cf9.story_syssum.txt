"Things like this rarely happen here," said Yadira Abigail Flores Delgado, who works at a nearby private security firm.
The outcome, however, was sweet for the administration of President Felipe Calderon.
"This action represents a major achievement for the people and government of Mexico, and is a decisive blow against one of the most dangerous criminal organizations in Mexico," Calderon said, speaking from the U.N.
"[Beltran Leyva's] death has dealt a crippling blow to one of the most violent cartels in the world, and it comes as a result of significant cooperation and information sharing between law enforcement in the United States and our courageous partners in Mexico," DEA Acting Administrator Michele M. Leonhart said in a written statement.
On December 11, the navy got into a firefight in Cuernavaca with gunmen of the Beltran Leyva cartel.
Three of the gunmen were killed and 11 were arrested, according to the navy.
"There was gunfire, machine gun fire and grenades, some of it very close to the hospital," he said.
For such a high-level blow by the military, reprisal killings by the cartel are a possibility, Payan said.
A series of disputes over the past years, however, led the Beltran Leyva brothers to turn on El Chapo, or "shorty," and they have been most recently linked with Los Zetas, another violent cartel opposed to the Sinaloa group.
The slain brother, Arturo, was also named in those indictments.
Since taking office, Calderon has made fighting the drug cartels a priority.
"Calderon has finally understood two things: that the army is susceptible to corruption, and that the army is not sufficient," Payan said.
