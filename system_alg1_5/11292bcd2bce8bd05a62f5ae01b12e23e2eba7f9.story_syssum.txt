Like many of my colleagues, I devoted my time to caring for my patients and to research.
Yet, when I traveled to Africa in the mid-1990s, I was devastated to see what was happening there.
Today, as President Obama makes this historic trip to Africa, we are at a point where an AIDS-free generation is within sight.
The South African government, with support from the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis (TB) and Malaria, has saved hundreds of thousands of South African lives.
As South Africa's battle against AIDS has evolved, so has PEPFAR's support.
With the South African government in the lead -- coordinating planning and alignment of implementation with PEPFAR, the Global Fund, and other development partners -- will we see reduced costs and increased access to health and social services.
Thanks to the dedication of President George W. Bush, President Obama and bipartisan support from the U.S. Congress -- what a difference a decade has made.
