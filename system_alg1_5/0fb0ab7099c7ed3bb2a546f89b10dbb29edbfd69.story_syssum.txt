"When they saw what kind of cargo they were surprised," Nikolsky said.
At the time of the attack, the ship's captain, Vladimir Kolobkov, had taken seriously ill, tragically passing away a week later.
As the days and weeks passed, Nikolsky began to talk to the leader of the pirates, eventually gaining his trust.

"We couldn't believe it," he said of their moment of liberation.
The Faina sailed into the port of Mombasa, Kenya, a few days later where Nikolsky was reunited with his wife and family.
"But I spent at sea all of my life, 45 years ... (and) now I like my village, I like my job here."
