On this anniversary, it's worth reflecting on how valuations, particularly of technology companies, are being calculated.
A healthy cash flow allows a company to repay its shareholders and initial investors who, understandably, expect their investment to be eventually reimbursed.
Still, the money being thrown around is mind-boggling.
For example, Wolf cited Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp at $42 per user, which is in line with price-per-user acquisitions of companies like YouTube, Tumblr and Instagram.
Of course, not all overvalued companies are "bad" companies.
Sure, there are some companies, like Amazon, that don't meet traditional metrics of financial strength that end up performing incredibly well in the stock market.
But they are the exception, not the rule.
For every Amazon, there are several Vonages.
However, investors placing their bets on tech companies without basic fundamentals are more likely to resemble Ponce de Leon: map-less and looking hopelessly for the Fountain of Youth.
