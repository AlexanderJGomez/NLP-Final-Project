Now, Pistorius is playing the lead role in a more tragic tale that began in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013.
Born with a congenital abnormality, Pistorius, 27, had both his legs amputated below the knee before his first birthday, but through sheer determination carved out a career in world-class athletics.
For many, he was an example of what could be achieved through a potent mix of determination, positivity and skill.
After the shooting, a police spokeswoman said there had been "previous incidents" at Pistorius' home, including "allegations of a domestic nature," but did not say what they had been.
In an exclusive interview last summer, Arnold Pistorius said his nephew was heartbroken.

And that's the mentality that I've had," Pistorius told CNN in late 2012.
"We have no doubt there is no substance to the allegation and that the State's own case, including its own forensic evidence, strongly refutes any possibility of a premeditated murder or indeed any murder at all," said Arnold Pistorius before the athlete's conviction.
Pistorius' agent, Peet Van Zyl, referred to the sprinter as his "friend and a great professional athlete."
Another, Samuel Motau, described Pistorius as "a very generous man."
As a child, Pistorius competed in water polo, cricket, tennis, triathlons and Olympic wrestling and boxing, before he smashed his knee while playing rugby at the age of 16.
It ended a summer he later described as "a dream come true," according to his website.
"Obviously, being an international sportsman, there's a lot of responsibility that comes with that.
His account laid dormant for a year until the anniversary of Steenkamp's death in February, when he tweeted a link to "a few words from my heart" on his website.
