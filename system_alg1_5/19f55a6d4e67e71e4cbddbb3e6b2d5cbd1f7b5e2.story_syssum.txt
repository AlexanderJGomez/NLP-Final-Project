Apparently, Chief Charlie Beck thinks it is tolerable to have officers on the beat who use the N-word -- as a bar security guard alleged Hillman did -- and refer to young black men as "monkeys," as Hillman can be heard doing on the audio recording.
Or, more likely, it's a self-reciprocating reaction to both.
-- that will take you back to a time when virtually all black men in America were in shackles, and that line of thinking isn't productive.
In our communities, police officers are the face of authority.
As a society that struggles with a deep race problem, we have to trust that our police officers are not racists.
If you run, or resist, or fight, it will be used against you.
When there is evidence of racism in these transactions, report it.
