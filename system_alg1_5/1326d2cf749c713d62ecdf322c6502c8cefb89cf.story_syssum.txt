(CNN) -- Martin Kaymer has claimed golf's No.
For myself, my family and the people I work with, it's a great achievement," Kaymer told reporters.
European Tour No.
The 33-year-old opened the day in fine style with a 5 & 4 win over Moore as he led from the first green, and won three holes in a row from the eighth before his fifth birdie of the match at 14 sealed it.
Yang, who beat U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell on Friday, was never ahead in the match and trailed by four holes after the eighth, then Kuchar matched his four consecutive pars to 17.
