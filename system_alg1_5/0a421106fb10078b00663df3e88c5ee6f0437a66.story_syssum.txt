Shortly after Bruna Bianchi Goldman arrived in her homeland she called to say she wanted a divorce, which she obtained in Brazil, and would stay there with their son, Sean.
Obviously, if not, we will continue to raise it with the Brazilian government."
Sean Goldman is said to be living with his stepfather, who has been granted provisional guardianship.
"I would tell him that he's been very brave, as he has fought to have his son returned to him," Clinton said in the NBC interview.
But on Larry King Live, Helvecio Ribeiro, a Bianchi family spokesman, questioned Goldman's fitness as a parent.
"And Mr. Goldman, while Bruna was still alive, failed to do so," Ribeiro said.
The next step in this case is uncertain.
