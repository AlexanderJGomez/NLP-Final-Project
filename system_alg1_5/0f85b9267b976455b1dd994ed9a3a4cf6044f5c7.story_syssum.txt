By contrast, in most people's eyes, those who are normal only need to work hard and they will have at least a good career.
Nevertheless, many people struggle to find their passions.
Yes, some are lucky.
In the absence of the lucky circumstance of their family, the search would have been longer and more challenging.
You cannot find your passion idly staring into space, hoping for it to appear as a revelation, from one book, article, blog posting or casual conversation.
Some do both.
But you cannot just read, talk or experience.
Yes, it is intense.
You will have to stand against the popular culture to find your passion.
Usually, it is quite easy.
Some people find their passion, and then relying on no more than popular opinion, they dismiss the passion as one that "cannot be turned into a livelihood."
And they move on to try to find a second, more practical love.
Remember that passion is necessary for a great career, but it is not sufficient.
