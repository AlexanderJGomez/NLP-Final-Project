But "it appears that deadly force has been used and that a number of people have been killed or wounded," the relief agency said.
But Shahriar Kia, a spokesman for the MEK, said 44 of its members were killed.
The officials said there were casualties from the raid, but they said they could provide no further details.
Maryam Rajavi, the head of the MEK's political arm, called for those remaining at Camp Ashraf to be transferred to the United States or put under the protection of U.N. peacekeepers.
The MEK's new site at Camp Hurriya, the base formerly known as Camp Liberty, has come under fire as well.
Sunni-Shiite frictions have escalated since an April incident in Hawija, in northern Iraq, where Iraqi security forces raided a site used by Sunni protesters to demonstrate against the Shiite-led government.
