Goody, 27 tied the knot with boyfriend Jack Tweed, 21, in Hatfield Heath, Essex, east of London, UK media reported.
News of Goody's condition has sparked massive interest in the UK, both from the media -- which bid for rights to her story -- and among the public, who have contacted charities for information about cervical cancer.
Critics have attacked Goody's decision to sell rights to what may be her final weeks, although the star has told British media that she wants to leave her children by a previous relationship -- sons, Bobby, five, and Freddie, four -- financially secure.
"Read an article on Jade Goody's deteriorating condition," wrote Shetty.
"She wants the best for her kids," Shetty wrote.
The wedding dress, which media reports say included a pouch to hold Goody's medication, was donated by Harrods owner Mohamed al Fayed.
