It's the people's house, and Michelle Obama totally gets it.
If they sense you're a phony, forget it.
But around the first lady, they want to hug her and laugh with her and tell her stories.

She knows exactly who she is.
Michelle Obama's unassuming, but dead-on, sense of style has the fashion press gushing all over itself.
Ok, I admit it.
