In November, a loya jirga, or grand assembly of Afghan elders, endorsed the continued presence of U.S. forces after combat operations, but only if the countries could agree on the transfer of prisoners, an end to night raids and eliminating immunity for U.S. troops accused of committing crimes in Afghanistan.
On Friday, his spokesman, Aimal Faizi, called the agreement "big progress."
"We have had our challenges, and there will be challenges ahead as we continue negotiations on the framework for our strategic partnership, but this MOU marks an important step forward," he said.
Afghan commanders also would not have the authority to release detainees on their own, according to agreement.
The group also complained in 2010 about allegations of abuse, including isolation, sleep deprivation and exposure to extreme temperatures, at a screening facility at Bagram Air Base.
U.S. President Barack Obama apologized for the incident, saying it was inadvertent.
