(CNN) -- A Louisiana judge has ordered prosecutors to release their files on the deaths of patients at a New Orleans hospital in the days following Hurricane Katrina, finding that no related legal cases are in the works.
There was no immediate word on whether any of those parties would appeal, but Lori Mince, one of the lawyers who represented CNN, said she expected someone will do so.
Foti said the four, who ranged in age from their early 60s to their early 90s, were given a "lethal cocktail" of morphine and another depressant, midazolam hydrochloride.
Pou and the nurses, Lori Budo and Cheri Landry, denied the charges, and their attorneys said they acted heroically by staying to treat patients rather than evacuate.
All five were brought in by Foti's office to analyze the deaths, and concluded the patients were homicide victims.
