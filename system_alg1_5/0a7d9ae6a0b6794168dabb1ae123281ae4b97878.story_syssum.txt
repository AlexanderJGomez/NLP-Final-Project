"We figured it would be better to simplify that process and reduce the number of boarding groups," said United spokesman Charles Hobart.
"If families do need additional assistance, our gate agent will work to accommodate them," Hobart said.
"We transitioned to a common boarding process across all aircraft," Hobart said.
As a policy, American Airlines also does not specifically allow families with children to get on aircraft before general boarding.
"We're always looking for ways to make the boarding process a little more efficient and quicker for our passengers," said spokeswoman Liz Landau.
