But in his online journal, McFaul said Tuesday that he would miss the job, stressing he was leaving for family considerations.
"I will leave Russia reluctantly," he said.
As a Stanford University political science professor, McFaul became one of the best-known American experts on Russia.
McFaul's ambassadorship came at a time of strained relations between the two countries, with quarrels over, among other things, Syria's civil war and the arrival in Moscow of admitted National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden.
CNN first learned of McFaul's planned departure on Twitter.
