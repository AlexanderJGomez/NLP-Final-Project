(CNN)  -- Two U.S. journalists who had been detained by North Korea were traveling back to the United States with former President Clinton hours after being pardoned, a Clinton spokesman said.
"Clinton expressed words of sincere apology to Kim Jong Il for the hostile acts committed by the two American journalists against the DPRK after illegally intruding into it," the news agency reported.
He described Clinton's trip as a "solely private mission to secure the release of two Americans."
Ling and Lee are reporters for California-based Current TV -- a media venture launched by Clinton's former vice president, Al Gore.
The visit by the former president, whose wife, Hillary Clinton, is the Obama administration's secretary of state, came about three weeks after the United States dropped a request that Ling and Lee be released on humanitarian grounds.
Clinton's mission came as the United States and its allies in the region are seeking to persuade North Korea to return to nuclear disarmament talks, which have stalled.
Former President Clinton had considered visiting North Korea in 2000 near the end of his second term as president.
