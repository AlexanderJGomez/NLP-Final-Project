French military sources had earlier said that Abdelhamid Abou Zeid, a deputy leader of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, was killed in an airstrike in Mali late last month.
Military sources quoted by French media say that in the past few days, Abou Zeid and a substantial number of his fighters were killed during a French bombardment near Aguelhok in northern Mali.
At the beginning of this year, Abou Zeid joined other Islamist forces making a push southward toward the capital, Bamako.
The following year, a French aid worker, 78-year old Michel Germaneau, was killed as French commandos tried to rescue him.
Abou Zeid's group also staged a raid on a uranium mine in neighboring Niger -- abducting seven workers, four of whom, all French, are still being held.
By all accounts, the two were very different characters.
Abou Zeid made several trips to Libya in 2011, according to one source familiar with intelligence from the area.
In December, before the French intervention in Mali, he accused the French authorities of blocking negotiations for their safe release.
If Abou Zeid was indeed killed, the expectation is his group will retaliate.
