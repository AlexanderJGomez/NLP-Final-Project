"You feel like you're in a fight with one hand tied behind your back," said Mosier, 56.
Mosier was able to get her required surgery, but her doctor, Dr. Wendel Naumann, was unable to get Doxil, the chemotherapy treatment she needed.
In November 2011, Mosier appeared on CNN's "Sanjay Gupta, MD" to share her ordeal.
On June 29, 2012, Mosier died.
"The committee has learned that FDA regulatory activity has effectively shut down 30% of the total manufacturing capacity at four of America's largest producers of generic injectable medications," it said.
"Let me just say, very clearly, that the report is incorrect," Dr. Sandra Kweder of the FDA said on "Sanjay Gupta, MD."
Kweder is the deputy director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Office of New Drugs.
However, Ben Venue maintained that none of the Doxil supply was affected.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA deputy commissioner, said the FDA isn't concerned about the outcome, though.
"Well, it's our job to worry about it in our drug shortages team.
"It allows us as a regulatory agency to step in, and try and prevent the shortage in the first place," Kweder said.
"The key is having enough notice," says Kweder.
"I think it's a start," says Naumann, but it's not enough.
For Mosier's daughters, it's all too late.
