The incident began when some teenagers became angry when they were asked to show identification for a tobacco purchase, said Erdaogan Yavuz, the manager of the OK Gas Station in Wantagh, New York, told CNN.
All five began to assault Yavuz and his co-worker, Yuksel Cebeci, Yavuz said.
Cebeci was treated for broken fingers, Yavuz said.
A surveillance video from the gas station is in the hands of prosecutors, officials said.
