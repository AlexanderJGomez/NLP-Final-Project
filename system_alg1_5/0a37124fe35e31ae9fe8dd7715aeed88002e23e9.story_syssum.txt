Bush praised Townsend's work Monday.
Townsend's job, as the president's top adviser on fighting terrorism, involved identifying terrorist groups around the globe and assessing their threat, and finding ways to track and cut off their funding.
Townsend's name had come up during the president's recent search for a new attorney general, but she was not considered.
"It was a hard decision as I have loved and will cherish my every minute of service," she said in an e-mail.
