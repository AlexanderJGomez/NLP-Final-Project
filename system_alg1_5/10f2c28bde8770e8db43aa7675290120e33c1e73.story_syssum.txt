The theory behind space planes is they would be able to take off from a runway, rocket into low orbit, and then fly to a landing on a runway.
"As far as coolness factor -- Skylon wins over Dream Chaser hands down," gregory writes.
Then, down the road, suborbital test flights reportedly could happen as soon as 2016, if all goes well.
It's based on well-known design concepts, which saves money on development costs.
Yes, they were gumdrop-shaped with less "coolness factor," but they got the job done.
Landing on a runway costs a lot less, Dem suggests.
A longer view may be to develop a spacecraft that can travel to low orbit and travel to the moon -- or beyond.
