LONDON, England (CNN) -- British union leaders will recommend Thursday ending an unofficial strike that has dragged on more than a week at the country's third-largest oil refinery, the arbitrator in the dispute announced Wednesday.
The French-based oil company Total, which owns the plant, confirmed a deal was in the cards.
Union leaders accuse Total of discriminating against British workers by subcontracting with IREM, which has hired workers from Italy and Portugal.
Overall, the construction project has employed, directly or indirectly, 600 to 1,000 workers for about 18 months, Total said.
ACAS will investigate the bidding process and report within weeks, it said Wednesday.
Representatives of all four plants said contractors, not full-time staff, had walked off the job, and all said operations were not affected.
The problem is that employers are excluding UK workers from even applying for work on these contracts," Unite General Secretary Derek Simpson said Tuesday.
Brown retorted in the House of Commons.
