Madrid (CNN) -- Years on the run as a suspected member of the feared "Pink Panthers" gang of international jewel thieves have ended for a Serbian man who's been arrested in a Madrid suburb, Spanish police said Wednesday.
Spanish police have been on the trail of Pink Panther suspects, and they zeroed in on Ilincic in the town of Alcala de Henares near Madrid.
Spanish police released video of the 2007 robbery at the Dubai shopping mall that showed a frightened store employee hiding behind a door while a hooded man, in another room, smashed glass windows to steal jewels.
A Spanish police spokesman said Madrid officers don't know if the hooded man in the robbery video is Ilincic.
