Liverpool, which sits four points behind leader Chelsea with a game in hand, was a class apart on an afternoon where United's deficiencies were laid bare for all to see.
The Manchester United defense will not have had a harder game than against our strikers today.
We have to treat Cardiff and Sunderland the same as Manchester United.
Worse for United is the success of its greatest rival - Liverpool.
United, with Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Robin van Persie, all on the field, struggled to make any real impact.
United tried to respond and was unfortunate to be awarded a penalty when Glen Johnson appeared to handle.
Sturridge attempted a shot from the edge of the penalty area and when the ball was deflected into Suarez's path, the forward coolly slotted the ball home.
"We're going to win the league," sang the Liverpool supporters.
The victory moves Arsenal to within four points of leader Chelsea with a game in hand.
