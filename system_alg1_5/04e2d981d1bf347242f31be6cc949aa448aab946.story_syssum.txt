Frances Townsend says the director of the CIA is not a post for on-the-job training.
The nation has gone more than seven years without a terrorist attack and much of the credit for that lies with the men and women of the intelligence community: in the CIA, FBI, and Defense and Homeland Security departments, among others.
Because of the critical role the intelligence community plays in protecting our nation, the director of the CIA is not a position for on-the-job training.
Mr. Brennan's loyalty was to the mission and role of the intelligence community in protecting our nation.
Regardless of who becomes the next CIA director, the nation is fortunate that from the deputy director on down, the CIA is run by career officials who will continue to do the nation's business.
The nation and the intelligence community deserve better and must be led with the same courage that they have displayed.
If Mr. Panetta is to be the next CIA director, he will need to earn the trust, confidence and respect of career intelligence officials.
