On March 31, 2014, at 11 p.m., I received a phone call from my 25-year-old son.
"Mom, I've been arrested.
To think about my son, vibrant and ambitious, being held in the bondage of incarceration is inconceivable.
In Afghanistan, he had his Marine Corps brothers who always had his back.
I am outraged.
Today I have learned to walk without shame, boldly and compassionately, through the corridors of bars and locks and have a newfound perspective for those imprisoned.
Through faith, I will continue choosing not to be crippled by the weight of the dismay, trauma, and disbelief associated with this, and I will be steadfast in my determination to overcome the barriers of this injustice.
