"What we do know is that last Wednesday, shortly after 7 o'clock, we received a 911 call from a gentleman stating that his 2-1/2-year-old son accidentally shot his mother -- the boy's mother," Rues told HLN's Vinnie Politan.
"My son picked it up and I tried to grab it," the man said about the gun.
The boy's father could face charges of negligence, she said.
It's not safe," she said.
