To my friends, I am one of the guys.
And, to so many over the years who have known my story, I am a man in a race -- a race against illness, against fear, against discrimination.
And, so, the race began.
And, oddly enough, I would not trade it with anyone.
About simplicity: More, bigger, nicer, pale in comparison to gifts like sunsets and the laughter of children at play.
So, I run ... for those I love and, even, for those I have never met.
