"It was horrible.
The Carnival Triumph, became a major media story, when it caught fire off the coast of Mexico.
But for some, like passenger Norma Reyes, it was too little too late.
"The hallways were toxic," said Reyes, who said she would never go on a Carnival cruise again.
"No power, no toilets, nothing.
I mean, it was was disgusting, but the staff, they did such an amazing job," said Joseph Alvarez.
Some families gathered at the Alabama Cruise Terminal, far from where the ship was originally supposed to dock in Galveston, Texas.
Poret said toilets on the ship worked on and off, but were too inconsistent to trust.
Well, no joke."
During less stressful times, passengers passed the hours playing cards, walking the deck and going to see what was happening on other areas of the ship, Poret said.
Passengers boarded buses to Galveston, where the cruise originated, or Houston, or went to spend the night in a hotel in New Orleans.
"The passengers on the ship aren't going to have a great deal of recourse when they get home," he said.
In 2010, the Carnival cruise ship Splendor lost power after an engine room fire, leaving it drifting off the Pacific coast of Mexico.
After this ill-fated cruise, the Carnival Triumph won't host vacationing passengers until at least mid-April.
