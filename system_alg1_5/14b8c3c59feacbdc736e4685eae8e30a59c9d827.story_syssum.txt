Mitchell was not in court that day, she said.
Mitchell is accused of abducting Smart, then 14, at knifepoint from her bedroom in her family's Salt Lake City, Utah, home in June 2002.
Earlier this month, Kimball ruled Mitchell, now 56, is competent to stand trial.
A state court had ruled she could be forcibly medicated, and that ruling led federal prosecutors to file charges against her.
She faces between one and 15 years in prison on the state charge, but prosecutors agreed to allow that sentence to run concurrently with the federal sentence.
