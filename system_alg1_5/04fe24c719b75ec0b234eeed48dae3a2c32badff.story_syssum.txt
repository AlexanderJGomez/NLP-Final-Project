(CNN) -- Over the past week, two popular Internet messaging companies, SnapChat and Skype, were hacked.
Yes, absolutely.
SnapChat then blogged that it knew about the flaws, but was satisfied with the changes it implemented and didn't expect the service to be exploited.
Skype, a division of Microsoft, can't even say that.
Unfortunately, the answer is no.
The social media accounts of Skype that were accessed by the Syrian Electronic Army had optional two-factor authentication available, but it was apparently not enabled by Skype.
No user info was compromised.
But this is 2014.
