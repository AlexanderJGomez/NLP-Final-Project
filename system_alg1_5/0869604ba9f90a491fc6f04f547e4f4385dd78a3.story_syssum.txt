Two people were killed on Tuesday and dozens injured in clashes between supporters of Diallo's UFDG and police.
The two largest ethnic groups, Peul and Malink√© form the principle bases of support for Diallo's UFDG party and Conde's RPG party respectively.
"We need to be extremely careful because our country runs a big risk when politicians at the highest levels act they way they are acting today," Faya Minimono, a senior official of Diallo's UFDG party said Saturday.
A military junta has ruled the country since taking power in a coup after the death of longtime autocrat Lansana Conte in December 2008.
