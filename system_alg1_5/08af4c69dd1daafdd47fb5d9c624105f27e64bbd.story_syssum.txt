Investigators are in touch with two other police departments investigating the recent discovery of body parts in their jurisdictions, said Toronto Det.
Liu's torso is still missing.
Peel Regional Police, near Toronto, last week said an arrest was made in Liu's death.
The Niagara River case is not related to Liu's death, police have said.
