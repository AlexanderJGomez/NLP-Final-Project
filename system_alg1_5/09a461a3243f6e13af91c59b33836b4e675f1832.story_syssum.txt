What's at stake is I-522, the initiative that would mandate labeling food that is genetically modified.
For Ben and myself, it's simple -- being honest with your customers is the foundation of good business.
In Washington, supporters of labeling have raised money from more than 13,000 contributors, with the median donation of $25 a pop.
If I-522 passes in Washington, it would be the first no-strings-attached legislation for mandatory labeling.
Momentum is building.
At the very least, there should be transparency and disclosure.
