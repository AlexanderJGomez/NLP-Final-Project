(CNN) -- Authorities in some Afghan prisons are torturing detainees into confessions, using methods that meet the international definition of torture, according to a new U.N. report.
"Torture methods such as electric shock, threat of rape, twisting of sexual organs etc.
"Despite their cruel and barbaric acts," terrorists are being treated "humanely and in accordance with the law," the Afghan government said, in a response included in the UNAMA report.
Torture was used on some children under 18, the report said.
Countries with troops in Afghanistan should suspended transfer of detainees to facilities "where credible allegations or reports of torture and ill treatment have been made pending a full assessment," the report said.
We are happy that this report also testifies in a part that torture did not take place in a systematic manner in all NDS headquarters."
