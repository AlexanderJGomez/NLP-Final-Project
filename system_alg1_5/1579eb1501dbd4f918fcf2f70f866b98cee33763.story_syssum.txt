"It's been a struggle to get to this point, but today I will say I'm very proud that the NFL has decided to stand up for all the former players who are suffering from brain injuries," Kevin Turner, a former NFL running back who has been diagnosed with ALS, said during a teleconference.
"My hope is that any players or ex-players that are suffering, or begin to suffer, from symptoms of dementia, will be taken care of in a respectable manner through this settlement," said Chris Dronett, one of the plaintiffs, whose husband Shane Dronett committed suicide in 2009 at age 38.
First, I'm glad that the league will finally take responsibility," said Tia McNeill, the ex-wife of former Minnesota Viking linebacker Fred McNeill, a plaintiff who suffers with symptoms of early dementia.
But, Anderson said, "at least they put the proper foot forward to say, 'Hey, these players, the guys who played the game before the current players actually matter.'
Meanwhile, the impact of the settlement may never fully register for former players such as Fred McNeill.
"I think he will pay attention for a minute, say 'Oh wow,' and then not really think about it until someone brings it up again," she said.
