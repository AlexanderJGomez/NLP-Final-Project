William Parente committed suicide by cutting himself, he said.
They were due to check out Monday, Johnson said, but failed to do so.
One of Stephanie Parente's roommates called the hotel room around midnight, Hill said.
The bodies of Betty Parente and the two daughters were found on a king-size bed in the hotel room, while William Parente's body was found in the bathroom, police said.
There was no evidence they were restrained, Johnson said.
She had planned to study in Newcastle, England, next year, Jolley said.
"There's a safety net in place," he said.
