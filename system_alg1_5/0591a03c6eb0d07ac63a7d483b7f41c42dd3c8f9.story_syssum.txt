The magic is photography.
We mustn't forget -- a magician's props, like a photographer's choice of camera, are only part of the illusion created.
But instead of marveling at all the choices, there's some grumbling.
They should have no fear of such a thing.
For me, photography is my memory.
For me, words are often inadequate, so I choose to define my experiences with photographs.
When we discover an old, faded, cracked and torn image, we handle it with care and respect.
My digital images, however, will never see the ravages of time.
It is all about time.
Let's embrace photography, as it exists now.
