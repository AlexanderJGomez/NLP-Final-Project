Badger and Salzgeber were two of the men who helped subdue the gunman during a pause in the shooting, according to witnesses.
Badger, 74, was at the event to meet Giffords.
When the suspect was on the ground, another person took a gun away from him, Badger said.
"I laid on him and held him down, and made sure the gun was down," he said.
The suspect had pulled the clip out of his pocket, Maisch said.
"I was able to kneel up and was able to take the magazine ... before he did," Maisch said.
