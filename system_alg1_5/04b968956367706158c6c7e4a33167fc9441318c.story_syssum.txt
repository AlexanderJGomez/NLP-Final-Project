The sheriff's report says Maldonado, 53, then drove about 460 miles north to Tallahassee in an attempt to kill his older son, JosÃ© Maldonado, who attends Florida State University.
"His dad did try to shoot him with the same handheld crossbow and the arrow hit Jose's ear," Dani Moschella, a spokeswoman for the sheriff's department, told CNN affiliate WSVN.
He slit his own throat, authorities said.
If you have a problem, solve it.
