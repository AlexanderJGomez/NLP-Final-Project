His journey for a new profession led him to Britain, Japan and ultimately back home to Ghana, where he stumbled into his calling after producing a line of herbal cosmetics.
Boateng, who won the Overall Entrepreneur of the Year award bestowed by the Entrepreneurs Foundation of Ghana earlier this year, sat down with CNN to explain how he went from a humble taxi driver to a cosmetics king.
CNN: You had been working as a taxi driver since you dropped out of school.
He sent me there, I learned and came back and they opened a printing press for me in Accra.
CNN: After all these accidents, you didn't give up though.
AB: This name "Chocho" is in the memory of a dear friend, who has passed on.
I'm an herbalist, I produce other products but some things, fragrance and petroleum jelly and that sort of stuff.
AB: [As] somebody who started from nowhere,  if I am in this area and being recognized that I am the entrepreneur of the year, obviously, I cherish this the most ... it means they are appreciating what I am doing, so I was very happy.
Now that Allah has given me that power, everywhere that I see that need [for] education, if it is in my power, I help them.
Whatever dreams that we have, we should think that it's human beings who can do anything in this world.
