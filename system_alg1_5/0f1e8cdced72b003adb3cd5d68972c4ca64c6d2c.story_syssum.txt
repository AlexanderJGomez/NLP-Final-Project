CDC quarantine officers met the plane after one of the 255 passengers was vomiting on the flight, officials said.
In a statement, it said that University Hospital "in coordination with federal, state and local public health officials evaluated two individuals who arrived" Saturday afternoon.
"The second individual, who was traveling with the patient, was asymptomatic."
"They were wearing masks and gloves on the plane," said a passenger from Paris who identified himself only as Chris.
"He nudged me and asked me to get the flight attendant," Burchett said.
They hurt."
The sick passenger and the girl were taken to the back of the plane, Burchett said.
He is not contagious."
"My concern is, if this were something that were highly contagious, we did not seem to have a very good reaction plan," he said.
"He didn't seem sick and then all of sudden I saw them taking him out," he recalled.
"He was lively," Costa said.
"We have already gotten well over 100 inquiries of possible patients," Frieden told reporters.
