Anton Caluori, 31, was arrested Tuesday at his home in Federal Way, a Seattle, Washington, suburb, Agent Bryan Molnar said in an affidavit.
Molnar said he and Federal Way police officer Andy Hensing went to the apartment complex at the address, where an employee told them Caluori was a "hothead" with a "temper" who lived with his mother.
The third time, a man later identified as Caluori opened the door, Molnar said.
Caluori continued to struggle and would not comply with our commands," Molnar said in the affidavit.
"Ultimately, Officer Hensing and I together were able to restrain Caluori and disarm him."
The safety was not engaged," the affidavit said.
"I think I do, but I don't want to say it," he said.
He was shown a copy of the e-mail to the FBI and, asked if he wrote it, said, "possibly," Molnar wrote.
Caluori is in custody at the Federal Detention Center at Sea-Tac, Washington.
His attorney, Kyana Stephens, would not comment on the case or the charges.
