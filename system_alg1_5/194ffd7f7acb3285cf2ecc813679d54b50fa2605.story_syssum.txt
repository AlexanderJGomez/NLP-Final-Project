(CNN) -- Amid public outrage over government corruption, unemployment and a lack of basic services, Iraq's parliament approved the appointments of eight new ministers to the Cabinet on Sunday -- but key security posts remain empty.
In December, after nearly a year fraught with political infighting, the parliament voted to approve al-Maliki's new government, despite the vacancies.
Saleh al-Mutlaq, who has been one of al-Maliki's critics, is the Sunni deputy.
At the end of 2011, the United States is set to withdraw all of its troops from Iraq as part of a bilateral agreement with the Baghdad government.
