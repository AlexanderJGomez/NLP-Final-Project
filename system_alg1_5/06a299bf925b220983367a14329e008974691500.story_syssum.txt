"I want to be clear that the Marine Corps unequivocally does not condone the use of any such symbols to represent our units or Marines," Amos said.
The Marine Corps said it became aware of the photo last November and the local command investigated, but found it not to be racially motivated, according to a statement released by a Marine Corps spokesman, Lt. Col. Stewart Upton.
The Marines involved were made to take a formal instructional class, however, so that they fully understood the historical use of the SS symbology, he said.
"Certainly, the use of the "SS runes" is not acceptable and Scout Snipers have been addressed concerning this issue," the statement said.
In Amos' statement Friday, the top Marine outlined the steps the service will take to make sure all Marines understand the Corps' position.
