Aid organizations, already struggling to provide the most basic necessities, now face the possibility of a catastrophic epidemic.
Even with planning for the worst, the IRC's director of humanitarian affairs, Gerald Martone, was not surprised when the outbreak was identified as cholera.
"In addition to preventing the spread of this disease," Martone said, "you have to aggressively treat the people affected, as you only have a few hours before someone can die.
It is a new disease and health professionals in Haiti do not have experience with it," said Margaret Aguirre, director of global communications for International Medical Corps.
"Water and shelter has been the continuing problem, it is a health issue," she said.
"Food, water, housing, jobs and medical -- those are still the same five things that they need," Klein said.
They need more tents, they will take them, tarps, anything, but that is like putting a Band-Aid on it.
On delivery runs, Klein said he finds areas that have not seen distribution in months.
"Creating self-reliance is the goal," Martone said.
