(CNN) -- There are "a lot of scare tactics in play here," Steve Butler, protagonist of the new anti-hydraulic-fracturing film "Promised Land," warns a local politician skeptical of the benefits of hydraulic fracturing.
The town, taken aback, puts its hydraulic fracturing decision up for vote.
Instead, the film falls back on many conventional anti-capitalist themes.
Of course, what the film does not explain is the incredible economic revolution that hydraulic fracturing has already brought to much of America.
As to the controversy surrounding the environmental safety of hydraulic fracturing, "Promised Land" offers little credible, scientific evidence to illustrate the alleged dangers of hydraulic fracturing.
Furthermore, Jackson said in February, "(Fracking technology) is perfectly capable of being clean.
By freeing up more state and federal lands for drilling, cutting unnecessary, burdensome restrictions while protecting wells and ground water with safe and smart regulations, every American might soon get his own slice of the real promised land.
