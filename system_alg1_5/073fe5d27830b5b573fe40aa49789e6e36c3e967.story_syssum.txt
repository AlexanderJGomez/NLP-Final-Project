"The Yemeni public is angered by the drone strikes," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he's not authorized to talk to reporters.
The attacks are part of a joint U.S.-Yemeni campaign against al Qaeda, and Yemen's government is unlikely to approve any measure that would limit the use of unmanned aircraft, the government official said.
Drones have had success in targeting small number of militants," the official said.
Drones also have been used extensively against al Qaeda and Taliban fighters in Pakistan.
