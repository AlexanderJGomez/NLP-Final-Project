Opposite the Burlington Arcade, right at the heart of the art establishment, on gallery row itself, African art formerly seen as a niche interest, now officially playing with the big boys.

And not only is this art alive, it is for the first time, moving through proper distribution channels.
To the female curators at the forefront of the movement, I salute you.
