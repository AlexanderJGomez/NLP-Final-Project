The mother ran from the house carrying her youngest child, though she was shot in both legs, in an "extraordinary rescue attempt," police said.
Both were in critical but stable condition, police said.
That rear house was also set afire, believed to have been ignited by the gunman, police said.
Firefighters were hampered by fears that the gunman might have been armed in the rear residence, police said.
The suspect should be considered armed and dangerous, the police chief said.
