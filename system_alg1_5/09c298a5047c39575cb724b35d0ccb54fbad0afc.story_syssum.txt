It meant that bacterial infections that would otherwise result in death could be cured with miracle drugs like penicillin, sulfa and tetracycline.
Some infections didn't respond to antibiotics, because the bacteria that caused them were "resistant" -- that is, they could disable an antibiotic, or pump it out as fast as it got into a bacterial cell.
The answer is complicated, but we can start with the turkey.
Worldwide, more antibiotics are used for agriculture, aquaculture and horticulture than for treating humans.
Because of this, the European Union banned the use of antibiotics in animals as growth promoters in 2006.
In the intervening 40 years, the evidence linking antibiotic use in food animals and antibiotic-resistant infections in humans has continued to grow.
Countries such as Denmark, which reduced antibiotic use in animals by 60% since 1994 through bans, government monitoring and voluntary cutbacks, saw no declines in total production of poultry or pigs as a result -- and no increase in the amount of feed needed to produce a pound of meat.
Clearly, however, many entities involved in the sale and use of growth-promoting and preventive antibiotics in food animals profit from this practice and have effectively fought to delay its regulation and restriction.
Encouragingly, the resulting decreases in antibiotic use in the community can be linked to decreases in antibiotic-resistant infections.
