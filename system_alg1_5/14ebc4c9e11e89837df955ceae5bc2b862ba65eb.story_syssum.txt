And on November 9, 1989, the people in occupied East Germany took control of their own destinies when they literally hammered the Berlin Wall to the ground.
Since August 13, 1961, when East Germany erected the terrible barrier that cut off West Berlin from East Berlin and East Germany, the wall became a dreaded symbol of isolation and despair.
Precisely one month later, the Berlin Wall fell.
Under this formula, the two German governments negotiated the internal terms of reunification while the four occupying powers -- the United States, the Soviet Union, France and Great Britain -- addressed its international aspects.
Bush played in German unification was pivotal, but Kohl and Gorbachev also played truly decisive roles.
In 1989, after all, the President still had further business to do with Soviet leaders, even as their country was rapidly imploding.
But 25 years later, on November 9, 2014, we should all enjoy a celebratory jig to commemorate what happened on that fateful day.
