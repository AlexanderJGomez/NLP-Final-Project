So now comes Herman Cain, accused of sexual harassment by four women.
Then, as they say, the truth will out.
Oh, and yes, he was good on their issues.
(We've come a long way, baby, in that some conservative women's groups are criticizing Cain's I-don't-recall defense.)
He is, of course, right.
When the charges are on the record, take on the accuser.
The voters will figure it all out, as always.
