Using the cell phones guards smuggled in, prison inmates orchestrated and facilitated killings, home invasions and drug trafficking, said Angela Dodge, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office.
Nationwide, the smuggling of contraband cell phones into prisons is a growing problem, the U.S. General Accountability Office said in a 2011 report, noting that the number of smuggled phones seized had quadrupled in a three-year period.
Thirteen of the former guards arrested are charged with racketeering, and four face drug charges, Dodge said.
Now, authorities said, some of the former correction officers who once guarded the Texas prison are behind bars themselves.
