Musician JJ Cale, whose songs "Cocaine" and "After Midnight" were made famous by Eric Clapton, died Friday night after suffering a heart attack, the president of his management agency said.
"Luckily, his music lives on."
"When I see myself doing this at 70, I go, 'What am I doing, I should be layin' down in a hammock.'"
"I'm so old, I can remember before rock 'n' roll come along," Cale told CNN in 2009.
"No, it doesn't bother me," Cale said.
