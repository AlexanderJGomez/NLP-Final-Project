"Given the backlash from the community, we have advised students to think of other forms of protest, instead of just focusing on occupations," Occupy Central co-founder Chan Kin-man told CNN.
Six were arrested, and the Hong Kong government released a statement denouncing the protesters as "violent radicals."
"If we do not choose to give up, then there is still hope and we can choose to utilize different tactics, to explore ways to counter the government," he said.
Chan and other protest leaders have proposed a "community education" campaign, in which democracy supporters would enter Hong Kong neighborhoods to sway locals to their cause.
"Our original plan was people would just sit down, holding hands, and peacefully let police arrest us," he said.
