"Both Houses will be back in session after their August recess on Wednesday, September 7th, so that was the date that was requested.
Boehner, in a letter to Obama, said the 8 p.m. speech would come less than two hours after the House is scheduled to complete legislative business, and the speaker recommended moving it back a day.
"This is the right time to do it (and) the right day to do it," Carney said in reference to Obama's speech.
However, a White House official said Boehner's office was consulted and raised no objection.
"Unfortunately, we weren't even asked if that date worked for the House," Buck said.
Meanwhile, an aide to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Boehner didn't consult with House Democratic leaders about seeking a new date for Obama's speech.
"Our nation faces unprecedented economic challenges, and millions of hard-working Americans continue to look for jobs," Obama said in a letter sent earlier Wednesday to Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada.
