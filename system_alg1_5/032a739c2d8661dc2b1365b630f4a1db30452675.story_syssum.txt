Singer Rihanna, the girlfriend Brown is accused of attacking, wants the case resolved without a trial, her lawyer said.
Rihanna, who is in her home country, Barbados, "is in fine spirits, she's doing fine," he said.
"If asked to testify, she will do so," he said.
When Brown appeared for his first hearing a month ago, Rihanna's lawyer asked the judge not to prohibit Brown from having contact with her while he faces felony charges of assaulting her.
"I am seeking the counseling of my pastor, my mother and other loved ones and I am committed, with God's help, to emerging a better person."
