A court freed him from detention on July 19, pending an appeal of the court's ruling against him.
"The leaked documents he presented as evidence, which he posted on his blog, caused a sensation in the Russian and international press, and Navalny soon became known as Russia's top crusader against corruption," wrote TIME's Shuster.
"Navalny quite bravely took on some of the very influential people in Russia," she said.
"He's become a popular figure but he cannot be described as the leader of the opposition," she said.
They didn't fabricate this case to allow that and it's obvious for me it's going to be a guilty verdict."
There is hardly any doubt that the verdict in the courtroom was not made by the judge himself," she said.
"The suspect is doing his best to draw attention to himself; one could even say he is teasing the authorities," said Vladimir Markin, the spokesman of Russia's Investigative Committee, in April, according to the Washington Post.
The protest hadn't been nationwide and involved just a few thousand people, she said.
"Their response, invariably, is, it's up to the court to decide," she said.
He remains at large and his verdict is not effective," she said.
"He is still on a hook.
For now, I will stay a candidate, I am not retreating."
The status quo is suspicious of any troublemaker," she said.
"Navalny's prosecution is meant to silence a leader and messenger," she said.
Not on previous occasions and not this time."
