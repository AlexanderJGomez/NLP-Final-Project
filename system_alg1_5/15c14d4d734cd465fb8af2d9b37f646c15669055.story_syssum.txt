Spencer Elden, 17, recreates his pose from 1991's Nirvana "Nevermind" album.
"Stuff happens like random cool situations where I get paid $500 just to go hang out," Elden said.
Like Nirvana, Elden hopes to entertain us.
"Some director's been calling me and wondering maybe about doing a movie with me as one of the characters in it," said Elden.
Really, all he wants is a guest spot on the "Howard Stern Show."
With "Nevermind," grunge, as the mainstream press dubbed it, had risen from "underground alternative" to the global mainstream.
"Nevermind" essentially sowed the seeds for music that defined the 1990s, said Tom Moon, author of  "1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die."
"They weren't the first to do this, but Nirvana took it in a much more abrupt direction.
"It was no accident that Alice in Chains, Screaming Trees and bands like that connected in the wake of what Nirvana did," said Moon.
