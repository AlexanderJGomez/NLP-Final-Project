(CNN) -- The global list of incredible viewing platforms designed to elevate your heart rate continues to grow, with Canada's Glacier Skywalk the latest gravity-defying walkway to welcome tourists.
The Glacier Skywalk is open daily, May through October.
The motivation behind approving the Skywalk was to make the area more attractive to tourists, said Parks Canada in a statement.
"Parks Canada needs to become more relevant to more Canadians by providing services and activities that respond to a broader range of visitor needs and expectations," it said.
