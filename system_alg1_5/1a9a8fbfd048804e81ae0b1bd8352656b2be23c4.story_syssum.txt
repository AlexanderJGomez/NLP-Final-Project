Frankfurt, Germany (CNN) -- Serving Germany's financial capital, Frankfurt Airport is one of the world's busiest international gateways.
"What is unique about Frankfurt is the amount of traffic," Klaus Wehle, supervisor at Frankfurt control tower, told CNN's Becky Anderson.
While most meals for economy class are deep frozen, for business and first-class passengers food is freshly prepared on the day.
Maik Herodek, section manager of LSG Skychefs, a catering company at Frankfurt Airport, says its hard to create plane food that isn't plain.
"All the ingredients are very fresh," he said.
