A new iPhone.
There were, of course, the expected number of early-adopter quibbles with the phone: from troubles with new carrier Sprint, to a sometimes slow-moving camera, to limits on the voice-activated Siri "personal assistant" outside the United States.
All of those numbers are within an hour or so of the iPhone 4, except for one.
Specifically, the theory goes, its location-based services are a power drain.
Apparently, reading from the well-worn Apple playbook, the company has not commented publicly about the battery complaints.
It's unclear whether the company acknowledges there's a battery problem (although there have been reports that Apple is contacting iPhone 4S users to try to get to the bottom of it).
But before that, there were the private e-mails and public statements saying, in essence, that users were holding their phones wrong.
And that's not always pretty.
"It's your iPhone 4S battery life, and it sucks."
