The protests have subsided for now, it seems.
But, there were other elements at work in the some of the protests; there are those who used anger at the video to promote their own agendas.
In response, the Coptic Church, both in Egypt as well as in the United States, insisted that it has nothing to do with the video.
They know about him now.
The Muslim community at large is not responsible for the violence, and it should not be expected to apologize for the actions of some of its members.
Before that can take place, we should be careful about whom we hold accountable.
The video did not appear in a vacuum.
That is, after all, precisely what they want -- for us to do their dirty work for them.
Hellyer.
