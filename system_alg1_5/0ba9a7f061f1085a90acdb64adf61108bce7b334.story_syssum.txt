Philippine authorities found Rodwell, a 54-year-old Australian, early Saturday in the port city of Pagadian on the island of Mindanao.
He was expected to be reunited with his brother and sister, who are in the Philippines.
"He is delighted to be free," he said.
"Having said that, we have no information or confirmation on that alleged ransom that was paid," Deputy Presidential Spokesperson Abigail Valte said.
"We hope they will be brought to justice, so others don't have to experience what Warren has just been through," she added.
