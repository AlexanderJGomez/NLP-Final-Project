"People are writing horror stories ... but people just can't imagine the kind of sickness we're talking about," said Dr. Nicholas Namias, medical director of the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center in Miami.
Brewer is heavily sedated, and the ventilator does not allow him to speak.
According to police, witnesses said the teens called Brewer "a snitch" as they used a lighter to set him ablaze.
"When you say he's doing OK, in this situation it means he's alive and responding to treatments," Namias said.
For now, all five teens are being held in custody.
Four of the boys, all 15 years old, could be charged as adults.
"There's no evolutionary mechanism to survive a 65 percent burn," Namias said.
"It's understandable that people can be burned in accidents," Namias said.
This didn't have to happen at all."
