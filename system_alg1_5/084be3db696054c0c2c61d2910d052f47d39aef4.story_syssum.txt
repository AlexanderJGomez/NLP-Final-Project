A roadside sign in West Point, Georgia, expresses support for Kia's new factory.
"The revitalization of the community is touching every aspect," Ferguson said.
"A lot of people feel that we are the savior for this area, which I hope we will be," said Randy Jackson, director of human resources for the manufacturing plant.
Overall, West Point stands to gain 20,000 jobs as a result of the factory during the next five years, Ferguson said.
But it's not only in the dollars, but in the hope and opportunity, and the ability to create new jobs."
"I came here because of Kia," Williams said.
"We'd go downtown and there was nothing there," Williams said.
"The job that I used to do for a long time, we thought we'd retire there," McManus said.
They want to see where the Kia site's gonna be built," Williams said.
"Once Kia announced they were opening we've sold mostly steel-toed shoes for construction workers," he said.
"It's been up at least 70 percent," said the 44-year-old West Point native.
It's starting to come here," she said.
It's an exciting time," Ferguson said.
