Between harsh weather, hunting and an annual cull, fully half of Yellowstone National Park's bison have died.
Previously, under the Interagency Bison Management Plan, wandering bison were sent to slaughter without being tested for brucellosis.
We're required to keep bison and cattle separate," National Park Service spokesman Al Nash said.
"I mean, it's hype, it's a hysteria," Mease said.
"The Park Service is meant to protect and preserve wildlife in national parks, not indiscriminately slaughter hundreds of [bison]," one of the protesters, 20-year-old Miriam Wasser, wrote in a leaflet she distributed.
"Bison are bison.
Bison are looking for food.
Control of the bison population is essential, Davis said.
They ran out of pasture.
"It becomes a private property issue," said Davis, who has never had a bison encroach on his ranch.
"They want the national forests and public lands to be all their public-lands grazing allotments, and in that process, they don't want bison."
"It is our job to protect the viability of this population," the Park Service's Nash said.
"The Yellowstone bison population is healthy, it's strong, it's vibrant.
