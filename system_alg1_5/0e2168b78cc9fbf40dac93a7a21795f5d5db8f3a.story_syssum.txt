That's how Utah County Sheriff Jim Tracy described a high-speed, bullet-riddled rampage that went on for 50 miles across two counties, until officers were able to corner a suspect.
"He was a very helpful person, and that's what he was doing," Tracy said, visibly moved.
The suspect, whom Tracy declined to name, is also expected to recover.
The suspect shot Wride, while he was still in his squad car, with what "appears to be a high-powered rifle," Tracy said.
He later crashed it, too, Tracy said.
When deputies caught up with him, the man fired at them, critically wounding yet another deputy, the sheriff's office said.
"He was a good man," the sheriff said.
