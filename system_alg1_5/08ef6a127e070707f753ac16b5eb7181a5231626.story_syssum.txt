Soybean yield is expected to be low too, though not as bad as corn.
Since mid-June, corn prices have risen about 60%, more than twice the projected decline in yield.
Not much, actually.
The crop losses will have the most effect on the world's poorest populations.
In 2008 and 2011, when corn prices went up to levels nearly as high as today's, the world saw a sharp rise in food riots.
In 2011, about 40% of U.S. corn crops were diverted to ethanol (a quarter, if we take into account that nutritional content is recycled back into feeds for animals in the form of distiller grains).
Some have criticized these projections as too pessimistic, and they just might be.
And farmers planted much earlier than usual, many using new drought-tolerant varieties.
In the long term, a warming world will be a difficult challenge for our crops and all of us.
