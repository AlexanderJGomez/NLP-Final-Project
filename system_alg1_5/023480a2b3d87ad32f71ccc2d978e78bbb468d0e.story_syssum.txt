On Wednesday, the world's top platinum producer, Anglo American, suspended all of its operations in Rustenburg, South Africa due to "intimidation" of its workers.
The mine, about two hours northwest of Johannesburg, is operated by Lonmin, which is listed on both the London Stock Exchange and Johannesburg Stock Exchange, and is the world's third largest platinum producer.
South African's president, Jacob Zuma, has opened an inquiry into the incident.
The stand-off later escalated into violence, leaving 34 dead, 78 injured and 259 arrested on various charges, according to South Africa National Police Commissioner Riah Phiyega.
According to Rosenberg, however, violence at Marikana could prove to be detrimental to the union's aggressive recruitment strategy.
The video appeared to show the police response was "very forceful," Turner said.
However, the charges are being dropped.
"Our members have been attacked, and that cannot be said to be clashes or rivalry, it is pure criminality," he said.
While there is no formal challenger to the role yet, this could spur the emergence of one, he added.
The company said last week that a "peace accord" had been signed, but key unions had not agreed to the deal.
It was unrelated to the mine incident.
