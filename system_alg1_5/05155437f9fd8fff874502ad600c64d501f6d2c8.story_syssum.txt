The American twice won gold in the 100 meters, the Olympic blue riband event, but he arguably achieved more in the long jump, a discipline in which he was unbeaten in all competition for a decade and won four straight Olympic gold medals between 1984 and 1996.
Unchallenged in the long jump, Lewis jumped 8.54 meters into the wind with his first effort, fouled on his second leap, and passed on his final four jumps.
Lewis, second on the track, earned another gold medal and was also awarded the world record for his time of 9.93 seconds.
Lewis had barely qualified for the U.S. team, finishing third in the long jump trials.
