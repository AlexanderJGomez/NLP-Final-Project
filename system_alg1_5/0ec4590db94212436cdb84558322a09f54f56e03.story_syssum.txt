Miley Cyrus, here in "Hannah Montana: The Movie," says filming in Tennessee was relaxing.
Miley shares the screen with her father, country musician Billy Ray Cyrus, who felt that a trip home would be beneficial to his daughter.
It's so important to be aware of where you're at and be focused on where you're going but, more importantly, never forget where you came from," the elder Cyrus said.
"She's a good friend, very loyal."
The two shared an on-screen kiss that, Till said, "could have been more meaningful."
"I have the best fans in the world," she said.
After playing "Hannah" for three years, Miley said, she's not ready to quit anytime soon.
