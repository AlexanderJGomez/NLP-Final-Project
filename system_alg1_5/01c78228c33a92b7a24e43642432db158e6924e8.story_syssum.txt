In the past, people had to settle for watching the delayed, edited bits broadcast on TV or websites, but technology and viewing habits have changed.
First, the good news: It's finally possible to stream any Olympic event live online, on a tablet or from your smartphone.
NBC, which is owned by the largest cable provider in the United States, Comcast, paid $1.18 billion for the rights to this year's Olympics.
These clips are a combination of highlights from events, interviews, profiles, and peeks behind the scenes.
To view them on iPhones, iPads or other mobile devices, go to the mobile version of the site, m.nbcolympics.com.
NBC Olympics has no live video, but tons of content that can be enjoyed by anyone for free, including news, results, video highlights, and the intriguing-sounding Twitter heat map.
There are two official apps for the London 2012 Olympics, and they're available for a mix of platforms including iOS, Android, BlackBerry and Windows Phone 7.
Official London 2012: Results App has live updates of results, as well as schedules, news, background on sports and athlete profiles.
Individual sports have official, automated Twitter feeds that will tweet out the results as they happen.
You can look up your favorites or follow this list of verified Olympic athlete Twitter accounts, the London 2012 list of Olympians or find a list just for your preferred sport of team, like Team USA.
Oh right, there's TV, too.
The channel will broadcast a total of 217 hours of Olympic coverage.
