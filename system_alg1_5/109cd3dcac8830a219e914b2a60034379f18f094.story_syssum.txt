Tuck had recently given police the videotape, saying he found it in the desert, Sheriff Tony De Meo said.
"You have to consider what kind of concerns my client had," the attorney said.
"The mother has cooperated with us," De Meo said.
A  resident of Pahrump, Nevada, he remains at-large, De Meo said.
Stiles was a distant friend of the girl's family, De Meo said.
"She's what you'd expect a little girl in elementary school to be like," he said.
De Meo addressed Stiles directly on Saturday: "Turn yourself in to your local law enforcement agency," he said.
The FBI is also seeking Stiles on state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor under the age of 14 in a separate matter, De Meo said.
