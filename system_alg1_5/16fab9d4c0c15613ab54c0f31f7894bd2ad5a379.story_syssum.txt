Monday night, FBI Assistant Director Kevin Perkins joined CNN's Rick Sanchez exclusively on "Campbell Brown" to announce who filled the first open spot.
The slaying, caught on tape in October 2008, was over drug money, police said.
Now, they knew Saenz, wanted in connection with four murders, a kidnapping and a rape, was still out there.
"Just gruesome, gruesome, cold-blooded," Chavarria said.
Investigators said Saenz suspected the mother of his child, Sigreta Hernandez, would turn him in, so he kidnapped, raped and murdered her at his grandmother's house.
"He's believed to be linked with the cartels in Mexico, bringing large amounts of narcotics into the Los Angeles area, Garriola said.
The chilling video, Chavarria said, shows why Saenz is so dangerous.
