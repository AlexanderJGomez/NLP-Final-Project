Gregory Lewis was arrested shortly before midnight in Fort Edward, New York, near the border with Vermont, the Massachusetts State Police said early Wednesday.
Police said that when New York state troopers tried to pull over the vehicle Lewis was driving for a missing license plate, he fled, crashing into a river.
Lewis was arrested on August 5 and charged with raping a 14-year-old girl in Southbridge, Massachusetts, police said.
After fleeing Massachusetts, Lewis first traveled to Charlotte, North Carolina, where he allegedly kidnapped, assaulted and robbed a woman on September 23, police said.
"This gentleman was literally shackled and held in the home, with a metal shackle," Southbridge Police Chief Daniel Charette told CNN affiliate WCVB.
The firearm that police recovered from Lewis after his arrest Tuesday night matches the description of the one taken from his relative's house.
