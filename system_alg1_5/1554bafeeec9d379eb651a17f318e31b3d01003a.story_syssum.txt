MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- Mexican authorities have detained the country's former drug czar on suspicion that he may have accepted $450,000 a month in bribes from drug traffickers, Mexico's attorney general said Friday.
Interpol, which is based in France, announced Wednesday it is sending a team of investigators to Mexico to investigate the possibility that its communications systems and databases may have been compromised, a prospect raised by the arrest of Gutierrez, the top official working with the agency in Mexico.
By comparison, the council said in a report this week, there were 2,700 drug-related deaths in 2007.
The drug cartels are paying some Mexican officials bribes of $150,000 to $450,000 a month, authorities have said.
