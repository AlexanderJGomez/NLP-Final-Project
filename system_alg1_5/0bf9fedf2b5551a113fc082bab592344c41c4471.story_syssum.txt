Viki, a site where dramas, telenovelas, comedies and movies from the globe are translated by fans, gives a glimpse into the cross section of the world's entertainment interests.
"Really good story lines are universal," said Viki's CEO, Razmig Hovaghimian.
"When it travels, it travels with its nuances, its culture and its beauty.
It's not about money says Nathalia Vela, one of Viki's translators who lives in Colombia.
"The treasured thing we learned from Viki is that we saw a world where it is run not by money, but run by passion," said Viki's co-founder Jiwon Moon.
We wouldn't understand what they were saying," he said.
"The diversity of content exposed to U.S. audience is very limited," said Ho, who is Korean.
"Fan subbing has been around a long time," Hovaghimian said.
And at that point, we knew it was working."
Rakuten, a Japanese company, purchased Viki in 2013.
"If we only licensed popular shows, that would've been a miss," Hovaghimian said.
When a certain number of fans request the shows, Viki looks into acquiring rights.
"There's something that's resonating," he said.
