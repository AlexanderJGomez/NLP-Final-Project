Walking past interactive shopping windows, yoga studios and outdoor green terraces, you arrive at the departure hall, a bright uplifting space dotted with paintings by the French impressionist masters.
No, this is not science fiction.
"Airports and flights will no longer be the price we pay to travel but instead will signify the start of our holidays where travelers can relax and create the perfect space to suit their needs whether they're flying for business or leisure," says Filip Filipov, Skyscanner's Head of B2B.
Future travelers will take complete control of their journey, which will be free of check-in desks and long queues.
Similarly, virtual shopping walls will replace duty free stores, with passengers able to order goods with a simple verbal command.
"That seat will become your home, in a way, in the air," says Filipov.
"It will actually be tailored to you, not in terms of how it looks and how it feels but rather the multimedia that goes with it."
