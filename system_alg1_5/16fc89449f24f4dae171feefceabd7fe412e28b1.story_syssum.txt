This year, 30% of Android users are likely to encounter a Web-based threat such as phishing scams, "drive by downloads" and browser exploits.
However, individual and collective mobile security risks are real.
Furthermore, mobile malware and spyware can pull sensitive data from your phone -- such as your credit card numbers, online banking or e-mail account login credentials or your contacts list.
It's an open platform, which presents significant pros and cons.
On the downside, Android's openness also makes it especially susceptible to malware.
"We've observed that most mobile users are far more trusting about how they download and install software on their phone, compared to their computer," he said.
Kevin Mahaffey, Lookout's CTO and co-founder, explained that spotting malware on mobile devices is a bigger technical challenge than on computers.
Mahaffey notes that if your phone is running an older version of the Android operating system, you face greater mobile security risks.
Unless you've rooted your Android phone to gain complete control over it, it's up to the carrier and manufacturer, not you, when your phone will get a system update.
This is why some brand new but cheaper models come with vastly outdated flavors of Android -- like the Huawei Ascend, currently sold by MetroPCS for $99 on a $50/month no-contract plan, which comes with Android 2.1 ("Eclair," released back in January 2010).
"If your battery suddenly starts draining really fast, consider that it might be malware," Mahaffey said.
Probably not," he said.
