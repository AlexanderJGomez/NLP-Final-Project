France, Spain, Portugal and Italy refused to let the president's plane fly through their airspace after rumors surfaced that Snowden might be on board, Bolivian officials said.
The president, who expelled the U.S. ambassador in 2008, said he wouldn't hesitate to boot the embassy, too.
"What happened during these days is not a coincidence, not a mistake like some governments say," Morales said.
The situation, they said, was a flagrant violation of international treaties.
"They keep having a double standard," he said.
... Let them apologize for once in their lives for what they have done," she said.
He has applied for asylum in 21 countries, including Bolivia.
"France, Spain, and Portugal's actions (were) not friendly toward Bolivia and toward Russia," the Russian Foreign Ministry said.
France "never intended to deny president Morales' plane access to (its) airspace," and the Bolivian leader is welcome in France, Fabius said.
France said Thursday it had refused the request.
On her website, Jonsdottir published what she said was the text of a letter from Snowden.
