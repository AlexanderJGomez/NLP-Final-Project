The wisdom of that literary caveat, self-evident to those who pursue the powerful, is particularly relevant to the Gov.
Molinelli was appointed Bergen County prosecutor by Christie's predecessor, a Democrat.
And Fishman is the appointee of a Democratic president with the blessing of New Jersey's two U.S. senators, both Democrats.
As a lame duck prosecutor appointed by Christie's predecessor, Democrat John Corzine, Molinelli will face heavy scrutiny if he tries to slay the king -- in this case, the governor.
Fishman, as the ranking Fed, can force local Jersey prosecutors out of the ring through a variety of tactics, if he chooses to do so.
Politics and pragmatism enters every field in our system, even criminal prosecutions.
Christie, as a former prosecutor, is far too smart to have left his fingerprints or interoffice "DNA" on any specifics of the bridge fiasco.
Nobody likes a snitch, even a political one.
Because as that wise prosecutor once said, "If you are going to shoot at the king, you'd better be able to kill the king."
