"The truth is that Maradona has always been very nice to me, even before he was our coach and I took my first steps as a professional," Messi said.
"But afterwards, we started getting used to him and he's been our coach for a while, so now it's normal.
Also, he's really close to the players, he's one of the guys, so there's no problem."
It's something very beautiful," he said.
Hopefully, it will be my World Cup, Argentina's World Cup and that we hit the ground running and play up to peoples' expectations and win the World Cup," Messi said.
And well, I've had the luck to be able to score more goals," he said.
"I already live with constant pressure to play well, to win titles and, as a result, I don't worry about pressure," he said.
They had a strong, easy qualifying and are very tough," he said.
