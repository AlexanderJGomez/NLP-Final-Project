When it was announced last year that we would be getting a Green Day version of "Rock Band," fans of the band (myself included) were pretty excited.
Playing songs like "When I Come Around" and "Pulling Teeth" brings back memories of college days, and yes, I will admit I wish they had put "All By Myself" in the game, because it's the only hidden track that Green Day has ever included on an album.
Hardcore "Rock Band" fans have posted videos on YouTube of themselves playing in expert mode and achieving five gold stars, which is something that not even the members of Green Day were able to do, according to a recent interview with MTV.
"21st Century Breakdown" has an almost steampunk feel to it.
As with most of the "Rock Band" games, when you earn four stars or more on a song, you get a reward.
We may not all be able to unlock achievements like "It's All Fun Until Someone Gets Hurt" or "Louder Than Bombs or Eternity," but we'll have fun trying.
