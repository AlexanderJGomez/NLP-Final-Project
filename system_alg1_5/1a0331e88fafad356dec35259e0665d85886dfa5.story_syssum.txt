Obama said as the Iraq war ends, America is "pressing forward in Afghanistan" and faces a "tough fight" against a nimble insurgency.
"From Marja to Kandahar, that is what the Taliban has done through assassination, indiscriminate killing and intimidation," Obama said, referring to the main militant and two southern Afghan battlegrounds.
"We will adapt, we will persist, and I have no doubt that together with our Afghan and international partners, we will succeed in Afghanistan."
"This is a different kind of war," he said.
Extremists want a war between America and Islam, but Muslims are a part of our national life, including those who serve in our Army.
"America's Army represents the full breadth of the American experience," with cadets hailing from all walks of life, Obama said.
