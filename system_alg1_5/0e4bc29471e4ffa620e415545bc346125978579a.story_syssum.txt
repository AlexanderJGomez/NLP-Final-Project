I wouldn't want to go onto another Games because this has been as good as it can get at an Olympics," says Chris Hoy, Britain's champion cyclist.
So I think I knew when I got up there (on the podium) that it was going to be emotional moment for me," Hoy told CNN.
Bolt, he says, is the face of the Games and an Olympic icon, but the Olympics isn't about just one person.
Human stories, that's what makes the Games special," Hoy said.
