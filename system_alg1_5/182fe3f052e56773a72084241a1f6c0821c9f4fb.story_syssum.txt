They had been abducted by unknown Bedouins, said Gen. Mohamed Naguib, head of security in the region.
The hostages were released after a day, the news agency said, after Egyptian authorities intervened.
"Two of our family members, Ismail, (age) 13 and Sara, 8, were kidnapped yesterday.
"Thankfully, we got them back last night," he said.
