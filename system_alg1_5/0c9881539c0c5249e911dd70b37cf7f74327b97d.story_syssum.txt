This year's broadcast, which aired Tuesday night, paid tribute to R&B great Al Green, the multitalented Sting, Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks, dancer Patricia McBride and comedian Lily Tomlin.
It's hard to do wrong with a Green song, and Earth, Wind & Fire led off with a heartfelt version of "Love and Happiness."
Gaga sang to him, giving "Faith in You" a little Green-esque soul.
Bruce Springsteen, Mars and members of Sting's musical "The Last Ship" performed for him.
