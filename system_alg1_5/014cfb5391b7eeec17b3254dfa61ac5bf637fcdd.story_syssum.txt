Tom Shupe thinks black bears have a people problem.
Parents disown yearlings, forcing them to find new space.
Instead of scaring it away, too many people say: "Oh, isn't he cute.
The bear comes back for more.
But the bear has learned people equals food, and does it again.
True, but only half the story.
Because our habitat is better than theirs.
And we offer protection from predators, mainly ourselves.
How did we turn this story into such a mess?
Today, it's full of trees and filling with wildlife.
No wonder deer have burgeoned out of control.
Guns kill 31,500 people annually in the United States, but hunters are relatively safe.
Don't swerve: Hit the deer.
No seedlings.
It isn't.
Instead, I've known people to toss them dog biscuits.
There are all sorts of ways to mitigate them, both lethal and nonlethal.
Feeding them won't.
