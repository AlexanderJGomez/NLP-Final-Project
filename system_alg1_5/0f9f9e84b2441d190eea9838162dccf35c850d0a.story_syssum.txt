New media, such as Twitter and texting, demand brevity.
As the historian Garry Wills has written, by stressing the egalitarian ideas of the Declaration of Independence, "Lincoln had revolutionized the Revolution, giving people a new past to live with that would change their future indefinitely."

In 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt declared, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."
In 1981, Ronald Reagan said, "Government is not the solution to the problem, government is the problem."
