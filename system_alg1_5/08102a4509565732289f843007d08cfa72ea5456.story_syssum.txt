However, this year the contest, which holds its finals Saturday, has taken on an unexpected degree of controversy.
Arguably, the outrages in Azerbaijan have exposed a hidden dimension of Eurovision.
Nothing about contemporary Azerbaijan marks it out as distinctly European -- it's Islamic, undemocratic and many, many miles away from the continent.
As the European Union engages farther eastward, through Turkey, it has to deal with nations and cultures like these that don't precisely fit its Western, liberal template.
In a way, that's a good thing, because it means that no matter how awful an entry is, someone is duty bound to vote for it.
For many of the new, Eastern participants -- particularly in the war-torn Balkans -- Eurovision became an extension of diplomacy, used to cement alliances with Russia or make amends with former enemies.
Britain's longstanding Eurovision presenter, Terry Wogan, quit the show in disgust after the UK's entrant, who was black, received only 14 points in 2008.
And how poor, too.
Eurovision was probably at its most hopeful and exciting in the early 1990s, when Europe was emerging from the nightmare of the Cold War and it had fantasies of a prosperous, democratic, unified future.
