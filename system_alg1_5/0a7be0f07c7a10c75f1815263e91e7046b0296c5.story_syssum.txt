The ISIS fighter, who speaks perfect English with a North American accent, is shown orchestrating the mass execution of a group of men.
It is too early to tell where his dialect is from, the official said.
The video then shows a group of militants executing the men, who fall into the ditch.
If so, Cruickshank said, he would be the first North American jihadist to commit a war crime on camera.
The video is undoubtedly propaganda and a recruitment piece for the terrorist group, Cruickshank said.
The video glamorizes ISIS, according to SITE Intelligence, which monitors terrorist groups.
