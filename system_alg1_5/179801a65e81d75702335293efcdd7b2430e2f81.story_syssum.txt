Ron Kozlowski, one of Bravo's attorneys, told CNN on Friday night that he has "not been presented with any new evidence thus far."
Police told Aguilar's family about the murder charge -- and, with it, the presumption the college student was dead -- about an hour before the public announcement, Tobias said.
"Christian's family is heartbroken, as expected," the police spokesman told CNN by e-mail.
Bravo's family initially volunteered to help in the search, only to be politely turned down by Aguilar's family, Kozlowski said.
At that time, a judge will assess the case and set bail for Bravo or decline to, thus assuring that the suspect will remain in custody.
