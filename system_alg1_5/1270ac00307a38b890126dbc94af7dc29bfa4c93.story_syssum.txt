"Chief Petty Officer Horne was an outstanding Coast Guard member," Jenkins said.
The crew of a Coast Guard patrol aircraft spotted the panga-style boat near Santa Cruz Island, suspecting "it was engaged in illegal activity," said Jenkins, who did not elaborate on the type of activity.
Then, the panga accelerated and hit the small boat, forcing Horne and another Coast Guard member overboard.
"The Coast Guard, along with its law enforcement partners at the federal, state and local level, are actively working to make sure all of the individuals who are involved with this illegal activity are brought to justice," Jenkins said.
