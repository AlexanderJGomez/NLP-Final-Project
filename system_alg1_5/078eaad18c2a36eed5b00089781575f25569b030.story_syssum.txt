Her knees, hips and ankles hurt from arthritis.
"I think people tend to think of this as more of a nuisance," said Dr. John Klippel, president and CEO of the Arthritis Foundation.
Researchers don't know the exact cause of arthritis, but they do know what puts people at risk.
"It's annoying -- it's certainly not good for the joints, but on the other hand, it doesn't cause arthritis," Klippel said.
"If you live in a warmer climate, you're simply more active for more months of the year and that's probably why people feel better," Klippel said.
"For people with arthritis, it hurts to exercise," he said.
"If aches and pains persist for more than four weeks, that's a time to pay attention," he said.
"I've learned to adapt," she said.
