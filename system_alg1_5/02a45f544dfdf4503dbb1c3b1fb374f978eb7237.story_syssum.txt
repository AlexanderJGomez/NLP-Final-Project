Sir Robert Owen, who's chairman of the inquiry, said Tuesday that sensitive material relating to possible Russian state involvement in Litvinenko's death would be heard behind closed doors.
In Alexander Litvinenko's case, such evidence could involve matters of national security.
UK prosecutors have asked for the extradition of two men, Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun, from Russia in connection with Litvinenko's murder.
Litvinenko is said by his widow to have been a British agent, with a handler at MI6, Britain's foreign security service.
The presence of radiation in Litvinenko's body complicated the autopsy, the inquiry heard.
In the course of the inquiry, evidence may also deal with the contamination risk posed to the wider public by the transfer of such highly radioactive material.
