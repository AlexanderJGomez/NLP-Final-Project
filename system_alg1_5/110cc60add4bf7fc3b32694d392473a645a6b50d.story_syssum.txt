There has been "no official confirmation or positive identification" that Bill Henningsgaard and his son were on board, but there is no reason to believe that it was not the two of them, his brother, Blair Henningsgaard, said.
Dannel Malloy said there could be as many as five people killed in the crash, including up to three people on the plane.
The mother escaped, he said.
One resident said the accident wasn't surprising.
The fuselage entered one of the homes, Malloy said.
