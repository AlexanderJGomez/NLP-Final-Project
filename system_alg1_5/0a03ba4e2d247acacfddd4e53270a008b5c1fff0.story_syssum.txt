Now, that's exactly where Britain's Martine Wright is setting her sights.
"I would love, absolutely love, to be part of the Paralympics in 2012," Wright told CNN affiliate ITN last month.
"I think I've done more now than what I did before," she told ITN.
Some 640 athletes from 20 countries are taking part in the event, the biggest major international competition before London 2012, according to Lisa Wainwright, chief executive of Volleyball England, the sport's national governing body.
"Even on your darkest days, there will always be someone that's worse than you are, unfortunately," Wright told ITN.
