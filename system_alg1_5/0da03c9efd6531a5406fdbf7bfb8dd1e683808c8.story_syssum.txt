GAZA CITY, Gaza (CNN) -- Israeli forces fired on a U.N. aid convoy Thursday in Gaza, killing at least one contract worker and prompting the U.N. to halt some of its operations in Gaza, U.N. officials said.
Ging expressed frustration with the Israeli military, which he said cleared the convoy to travel into Gaza.
"We are perfectly willing to take risks, but something has to change," Ging told reporters from Gaza City.
... You have to brace yourself for more," Ging said.
The Israeli military says its operation is aimed at halting the firing of rockets into southern Israel by Hamas, which has controlled Gaza since 2007.
More than 20 rockets were fired into Israel on Thursday, Israeli police said.
Mohammed Hamid, a Palestinian driver, told CNN Israeli forces are stopping ambulances evacuating the wounded.
Also, Israeli armored bulldozers demolished a home in Gaza "just as the lull was supposed to go into effect," he said.
Separately, four rockets fired from southern Lebanon landed near the northern Israeli city of Nahariya Thursday, leaving two people with minor injuries.
