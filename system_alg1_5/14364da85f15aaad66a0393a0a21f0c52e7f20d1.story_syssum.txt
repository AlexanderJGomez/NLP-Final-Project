When the second tower collapsed, there was no place for me to hide.
They weren't.
I was mostly fine.
For me, at least at first, it meant doing my job.
Don't get too close, we're warned; it will ruin your objectivity.
It was OK to relate to the story and be part of it, too.
I am not sure what my reaction will be in encountering this section of the exhibition, but no matter what, I'll be feeling a deep sense of kinship with all the other survivors in the room.
My hope is that by supporting the Memorial and Museum, I am, in some small way, honoring those who died and recognizing fully that I am still one of the lucky ones.
