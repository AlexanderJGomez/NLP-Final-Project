And the man who made it happen -- Howard Schultz.
Schultz: Well, when we started we had no money.
The most fragile asset of any kind of company, and certainly a consumer brand, is whether or not you can build an enduring level of trust with both your customer and your employees.
I think a great leader, at times, has to demonstrate a level of vulnerability and share with people how you really feel.
Schultz: But I would say something like this, that the success of the company is linked to the fact that the company really did try to have a conscience and a soul in everything it did and the success of the company was shared with its people, that would be enough for me.
