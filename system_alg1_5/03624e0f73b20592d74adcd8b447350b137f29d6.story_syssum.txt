Our panel consisted of Stephanie Brinley, senior manager at Auto Pacific; James Bell, editor and publisher of IntelliChoice and Jim Markwalder, veteran automotive consultant from Detroit.
"Compared to the overall industry, Prius buyers are more often women, have fewer kids and more often have college educations."
Its buyers are older than the industry average, with 88 percent born before 1946, according to Auto Pacific data.
"It's boring, reliable, efficient, and common.
A Toyota Camry in the driveway tells everyone that you know what is important in life, and it's not your car."
"All ages stop and stare at this car," said Bell.
"With 2008 sales of only 7700 vehicles, we don't have enough information about buyers to provide a strong picture of why somebody drives an R-Class," said Brinley.
Markwalder states, "The R-Class has always been a contradiction, looking like a minivan but not delivering on functionality."
Brinley adds, "It's an old person's cars, with only four-percent of its buyers from Gen Y."
