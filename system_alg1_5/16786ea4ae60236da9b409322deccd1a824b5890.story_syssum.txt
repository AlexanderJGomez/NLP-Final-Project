Webb, who is also president of the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football, says FIFA has a "responsibility" to ensure reform is carried out.
"I support the publishing of the Garcia Report, appropriately redacting to respect prior witness confidentiality agreements," added Webb, referring to Michael Garcia, the American lawyer who investigated the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding process for FIFA.
According to the FIFA agenda for next week's meeting, he will address members on how much of the 430-page report should be made public.
Earlier this year, Marco Villiger, FIFA's legal director, told reporters that it would be difficult to sustain witness confidentiality if the report was published.
His remarks came just before the Dutch Football Association demanded FIFA hand over a copy of the report, while Greg Dyke, chairman of the English Football Association warned that "urgent action" must be taken to restore confidence in the world governing body.
