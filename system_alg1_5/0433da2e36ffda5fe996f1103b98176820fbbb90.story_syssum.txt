Khairullozhon Matanov, 23, of Quincy is charged with "one count of destroying, altering, and falsifying records, documents, and tangible objects in a federal investigation, specifically information on his computer, and three counts of making materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statements in a federal terrorism investigation," the U.S. attorney's office for Massachusetts said Friday.
Matanov is not charged with participating in the bombings, but with trying to hide his connection to the Tsarnaev brothers.
In the hours and days following the bombings, Matanov contacted and attempted to contact the suspects by phone and saw Tamerlan Tsarnaev at least twice, according to the indictment.
A third friend, Robel Phillipos, pleaded not guilty to making false statements to FBI agents during the bombings investigation.
Attorneys for the men denied the allegations.
