The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the railroad, said late Sunday that "alerter" systems -- which require engineers to respond to alerts, sound an alarm if they are unresponsive and eventually brake the train in an emergency-- will be installed in every operator cab within the next year.
"It's not the cure all for all problems," he told CNN.
"I view the alerter devices as being only partially effective," Steven Ditmeyer, a former Federal Railroad Administration official who teaches at Michigan State University, said in an e-mail.
At the time of the accident, the train was in "push mode," meaning that the locomotive was in the rear of the train pushing it along the tracks, with engineer William Rockefeller in a cabin at the front operating it remotely.
By Tuesday morning, the MTA said, Metro-North also enhanced communication between engineers and conductors to ensure trains are operated at safe speeds at four other critical curves and five movable bridges.
It also said it believes that positive train control, a costly, high-tech system that targets human error, could have prevented the crash.
"It will increase the cost, of course, but the alternative that the railroads are looking at, and the federal government is trying to force on the railroads, positive train control, is certainly much more costly," Rangel told CNN.
