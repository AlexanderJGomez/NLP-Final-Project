In China, the captain's wife, Chen Tingting, said she was thrilled.
"The Japanese side bears full responsibility for the current situation, and it shall bear all the consequences that arise," Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said Tuesday in New York, as China escalated demands for the captain's release.
Neither country linked the captain's case with the arrest of the four Japanese nationals, however.
Japan's foreign ministry officials said Friday that China had informed them of the arrests, but they had no information about any charges or why the Japanese nationals had been detained.
Japan "illegally arrested" him and his crew of 14, China said.
China's Foreign Ministry said that Japan had "seriously damaged Sino-Japan bilateral relations" with the arrest of the captain and his crew.
