Founded in 1998, his K-Ballet company has built on the success he acheived at the Royal Ballet in Covent Garden, London.
Like any 10 year old boy, his new hobby had to compete with other activities -- he also enjoyed kendo, baseball and drawing -- but it was ballet that he really fell in love with.
In the spring of 1989 he turned professional, becoming the first Asian dancer to join the Royal Ballet Company (RBC) -- his first solo part was the leading mandolin player in "Romeo and Juliet."
So developed a mutual love affair between Kumakawa, his new fans and his adoptive city.
Not only had he upped sticks in the middle of a season, he also took five of the Royal Ballet's star male performers with him to Japan.
In 2004, Kumakawa established the K-Ballet School.
In the meantime, Kumakawa -- who continues to enjoy pop star status in Japan -- continues to pass on his expertise to a new generation of dancers.
