Some Republican lawmakers and a handful of Democrats are calling for a travel ban on people from the West African countries most affected by the disease.
Gov.
Not really.
No.
No, no, no.
Nope.
Rep. Tim Murphy, who led the house panel that sharply questioned top health officials over Ebola on Thursday, insisted airport screenings aren't enough to keep people out of the country -- especially since infected people can carry  the disease for up to 21 days without showing any symptoms.
But a ban might actually make things worse, he said, because it could encourage people to lie about their travel to West Africa.
Yes.
Nope.
And if American health workers are afraid they can't return to the United States, they might decide not to go at all.
