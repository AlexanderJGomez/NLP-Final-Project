Temperatures are just above freezing on Cypress Mountain, and Beck, a Sports Illustrated photographer for 24 years, is steadily ambling up the hill to stake out his position near the top.
He knows where to be to get the shot he wants because Beck and his assistant, Kohjiro "Kojo" Kinno have been photographing White for months, learning his every move and tendency.
"On their tricks, snowboarders are spinning so fast.
Beck, who has more than 50 Sports Illustrated covers to his credit, is frustrated even before he climbs the hill.
There's often disagreement, Kinno says, but they always come to an understanding.
Just before setting off for the hill, Beck gets a call from Steve Fine, SI's director of photography.
You'd think that Beck can call the shots, so to speak, and send in his favorites from the 1,400 images he will take this day, but that's not the way it works.
I make the best pictures I can, send them, in and it's out of my hands.'
There's one big issue, though, with White.
Beck says when he has used a remote-fired camera, he's able to get other snowboarders in the frame perfectly, but White soars so high that much of the time he's at the top of the frame, if he's even in the picture.
And with Lindsey Vonn such a compelling story, too, he's not sure that he'll even get one image in the magazine.
Back in the work area, Beck says not everything went well.
But while you're fixing things, you're missing pictures, and it's frustrating.
But these are the things you deal with, he says.
There is a picture, looking up the pipe of White, cast against a clear night sky, soaring through the air, on his way to a gold medal.
