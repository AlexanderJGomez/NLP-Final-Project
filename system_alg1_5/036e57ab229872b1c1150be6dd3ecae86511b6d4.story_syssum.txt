Nations such as the United States, France, Britain and Turkey, as well as Arab League countries such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia, have supported Syrian rebels and the opposition.
Jalili and Clinton spoke as violence raged in Aleppo, Damascus and its suburbs, and other hot spots.
Jalili, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, met with al-Assad to discuss resolving the 17-month-long civil war and rescuing several Iranians who were kidnapped over the weekend in Syria.
Iran's foreign ministry is working through diplomatic channels, such as the United Nations, to get the people freed.
Ventrell, speaking to reporters Tuesday, said Iran's contention that the United States is responsible for their security "doesn't seem to make sense."
Clinton, meanwhile, said that the opposition "is becoming increasingly coordinated and effective," holding territory from northern Aleppo to the Turkish border and seizing regime weaponry such as tanks.
The LCC said at least 33 people died in Aleppo, including 10 "field-executed" prisoners, as shelling engulfed the city.
Deaths mounted in other regions, including 33 in Damascus and its suburbs, 35 in Homs, and 25 in Daraa, the LCC said.
Roughly 17,000 people have been killed since the Syrian conflict began, U.N. Secretary-General Ban said last month.
