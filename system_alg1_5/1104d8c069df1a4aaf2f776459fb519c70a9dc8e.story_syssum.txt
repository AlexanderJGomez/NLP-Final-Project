Stritch died at her Birmingham, Michigan, home early Thursday, surrounded by family, Keyes said.
Just 17 when she moved to New York to study acting, Stritch made her Broadway debut in 1946.
Her Broadway debut came in "Loco," a comedy that ran for just a month in October 1946.
"The Ladies Who Lunch," from Stephen Sondheim's "Company," became her signature song when she sang it on Broadway in 1971.
