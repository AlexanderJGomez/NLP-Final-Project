Clinton has reached out to the Massachusetts senator "several times" over the past six months, a source with knowledge of Clinton's plans told CNN on Tuesday, a sign of how important Warren's wing of the Democratic party is to the foundation of a would-be presidential bid for the former secretary of state.
Since the 2014 midterms, Clinton has prepared for 2016 by meeting and talking with top Democrats about the strategy, tactics and policy that would make a possible Clinton run in 2016 campaign successful.
Erica Sagrans, the Ready for Warren campaign manager, said Tuesday that the meeting is another sign Clinton "is among a growing number of Democratic leaders who admire" Warren's liberal positions.
"Happy to welcome Secretary Clinton back to the commonwealth," Warren said, firing up the crowd.
