Cruz is going to run from the right.
Fifty years ago, another Republican senator ran this kind of campaign, Arizona's Barry Goldwater, who took on President Lyndon Johnson.
Right now, the chances are not great.
Even as the Republican Party has shifted to the right in recent decades, Republican candidates who have obtained the nomination, and those who have also won the presidency, always developed campaign themes that allowed them to appeal to broader coalitions than voters on the extremes.
As all the experts have shown, the electoral college math does not favor the GOP.
According to the Washington Post, if one looks at the states where the margin was narrow in the 2012 election, five currently favor Democrats (Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, Ohio and Pennsylvania) while in others, like Colorado, Democrats have a very good chance of winning as a result of demographic trends, namely growing minority populations that favor their party's nominee.
In 2014, congressional approval ratings plummeted to 14%.
The frontlash, Johnson explained to Bill Moyers is "liberals, independents, moderate Republicans."
Monday, Cruz will bask in the spotlight of his announcement.
