"The earthquake-proof table started when I was a student in industrial design at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design, Jerusalem," says co-inventor Arthur Brutter.
Brutter, alongside his former lecturer Ido Bruno, devised a cheap reinforced table that would be light enough for two school children to be able to lift, yet still strong enough to withstand up to one ton of pressure from above.
The earthquake-proof table "transforms energy and absorbs it," says Brutter.
Bruno says the awards are nice, but what is more important is to see the product adopted broadly, and used to save lives.
"It's always a good feeling to be recognised, but really it's not awards but exposure leading to the possibility of the table being used ... we want there to be no earthquakes, and we want it (the earthquake-proof table) to be used to save lives."
