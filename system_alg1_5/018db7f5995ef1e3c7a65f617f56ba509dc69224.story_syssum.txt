For smartphone users, like those of the iPhone (a popular device among early adopters), that number jumps all the way up to 63 percent.
Sites like PleaseRobMe.com, which humorously bring awareness to location-based privacy issues, may have scared some social media users from opting in.
"There's still a perceived risk in accessing location data," van Dillen said.
Because of privacy concerns, it is imperative for location-based services to clearly communicate the value proposition to users.
However, even though Gowalla, Foursquare, BrightKite and Yelp allow for check-ins at "places," rather than just map coordinates, which makes the data more valuable for targeted advertising, actual advertiser value hasn't yet totally materialized.
During its Chirp developer conference in April, Twitter announced the launch of its annotations feature, which gives users the ability to attach metadata to tweets, including location.
Facebook, meanwhile, will also reportedly soon enable members to add location details to their status updates and release an API so other apps can offer location ability to Facebook users.
Further, because location is off by default for all users, without a more clearly communicated message, the feature may remain off for many people.
So how they roll out location to users and how well they do at making users feel that their information is safe may be make or break for location on Facebook.
"Facebook could really be the looming giant that could wipe all [other location services] away," Boland said.
What remains to be seen is if the users will go for it.
