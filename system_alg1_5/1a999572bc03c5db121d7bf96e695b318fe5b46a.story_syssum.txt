A painting by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh, which was previously believed to be a forgery, has been authenticated.
He was only 37.
This child, too, was given the name Vincent.
He worked as an art dealer, a clergyman and a bookseller.
Because of his artistry, van Gogh has proved to be immortal.
The artists, on the days they drop the bottles into the water, can have no idea where they will end up, or who will find them.
Pull a book from any shelf.
The work, suddenly, is new once more.
But he is being too modest.
The brothers themselves, like all artists, will leave this earth, but the harmonies they created will go on and on.
He went to his grave a pauper, knowing that, for all his talent and heart and inspiration, he had been able, in his lifetime, to sell only one painting.
