Key to the case's dismissal was prosecutorial misconduct, mainly that of a detective, Armando Saldate, who said Milke confessed to the crime to him -- even though there was no witness or recording.
Milke's roomate, James Styers, took the boy; then called Milke saying Christopher had disappeared.
The detective, Saldate, said Scott told him that Milke was involved in a plot to kill her son.
Ultimately, the jury believed the detective and convicted Milke of murder.
In 2013, after more than 20 years in jail, an appeals court overturned Milke's conviction.
"This never happened in Milke's case."
Milke was released on bail, and the court said she couldn't be tried again.
And Milke left the court room, sobbing in relief.
