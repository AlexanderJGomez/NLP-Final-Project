Healthy oceans benefit all Americans, whether they live on our nation's coasts or in the heartland.
But, there's still much work to be done.
This is far from the truth.
The situation, on many fronts, is dramatically different today because of a combination of leadership initiatives from the White House and old-fashioned bipartisan cooperation on Capitol Hill.
In fact, an important milestone was reached last June when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced it had established annual, science-based catch limits for all U.S. ocean fish populations.
Coastal development continues, largely unchecked, and wetlands and marshes continue to shrink.
On top of that, major challenges that the commission could not see as clearly in 2003, including ocean acidification and rising ocean temperatures, further threaten some of our most valuable fisheries.
