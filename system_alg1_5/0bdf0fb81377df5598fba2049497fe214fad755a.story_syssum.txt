A desalination plant.
This is why a huge desalination plant is under construction in Carlsbad, California, some 30 miles north of San Diego.
"It is, after all, a seemingly inexhaustible supply."
There are some 16,000 desalination plants on the planet, and their numbers are rising.
"Desalination is growing in arid regions," said Tom Davis, director of the center.
"When other freshwater sources are depleted, desalination will be our best choice," said Davis, a UTEP professor of engineering.
But if the planet continues to grow warmer, snow will increasingly fall as rain and will be harder to collect because it will swell creeks faster and create more flooding, said Bowles of the Water Education Foundation.
This will be true of the massive Carlsbad plant, said Bob Yamada, water resources manager with the San Diego County Water Authority.
Ultimately, experts say, municipalities will need to balance desalination projects with conservation and water from more traditional sources, such as rivers, reservoirs and recycled wastewater.
It's dependent on water to sustain that economy.
