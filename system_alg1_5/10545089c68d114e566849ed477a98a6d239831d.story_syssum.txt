However, if the campaign activity is "incidental" to the official trip, the expense doesn't need to be split up.
A Senate aide said that because Landrieu was already going to be in Dallas, the office considered the fundraiser incidental and not an expense that had to be partially covered by the campaign.
Landrieu's campaign spokesman, Fabien Levy, said in a statement Monday that the charter company mistakenly billed Landrieu's Senate office instead of her re-election campaign.
Levy said Landrieu's re-election campaign paid for the flight August 4, almost nine months after the November 8 trip.
