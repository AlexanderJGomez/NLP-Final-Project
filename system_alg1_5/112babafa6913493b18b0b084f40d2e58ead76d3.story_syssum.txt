Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League, asked CNN's Chris Cuomo, in an interview on "New Day" that became a spirited discussion of marriage.
"You didn't need the law," Cuomo said.
"I think, if people say, 'Listen, I don't want to sanction polygamy or gay marriage or anything other than traditional marriage,' I think we need to respect that," he said.
"You don't have to be married to propagate," he noted.
"You need love," responded Cuomo.
"That's where we're going with this thing -- polygamists, also."
he asked.
That's what was ordained by nature, and nature's God."
"Marriage is about family -- it's not about love," Donohue said.
"Two sisters can love each other."
"If they love each other, that's great," said Donohue.
"So the law, fundamentally, was unnecessary.
"But that's the same thing," said Cuomo.
"I have Christianity, I have Judaism, I have the Muslims, I have Mormons, I have most of the world who regard this idea as being bizarre that two men should get married."
"I do believe that people ought to love gays as we would straights," Donahue said.
I think, sociologically, that's not correct."
