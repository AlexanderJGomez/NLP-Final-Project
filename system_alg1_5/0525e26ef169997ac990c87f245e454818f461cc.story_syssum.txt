Lloyd, 27, was shot once in the back and six times in the front in June 2013 -- the final two bullets fired as he lay face up, according to the medical examiner.
When Lloyd's body was discovered, crime scene investigators singled out one of two footwear impressions early on because one didn't match the "lugged sole" shoes of police, nor the shoes of first responders or civilian witnesses who found Lloyd's body, according to court documents.
That affidavit dated November 14, 2014, says that after studying images and home security video and having "consulted with Nike," investigators believe those three pairs of shoes are "believed to be produced by Nike and Creative Recreation."
Authorities say the "outsole pattern," of the Air Jordan XI Retro Low's allegedly worn by Hernandez is "similar to and consistent with the unidentified shoe impression... in close proximity to the body of Odin Lloyd," according to the affidavit.
Yet, it wasn't until almost a year and a half later, when investigators were making final trial preparations last November, that they "noted" the three pairs of shoes in photographs and realized they could still be at Hernandez's home, a search warrant affidavit states.
"Yeah," Hernandez said.
"Jurors will wonder why didn't investigators seize the shoes at the same time they seized many other pieces of evidence from Hernandez's home," says University of New Hampshire law professor Michael McCann, who's closely monitoring the trial.
