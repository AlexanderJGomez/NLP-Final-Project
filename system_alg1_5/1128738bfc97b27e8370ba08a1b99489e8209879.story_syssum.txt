Instead, "We'll continue to do everything we can to protect the American people from the effects of this awful law," said Michael Steel, House Speaker John Boehner's spokesman, without saying that repeal was still part of the plan.
"Never interfere when your opponent is committing suicide," Michael Tanner, senior fellow working on health care at the libertarian Cato Institute, said.
During a news conference on Tuesday, Republican leaders didn't utter the word "repeal" once.
"It's all negative," Tanner said of the Republican strategy.
Now, "voters are starting to experience bad news," he said.
"To get rid of it completely would be very difficult," said Ilya Somin, law professor at George Mason University, who was involved in Republicans' Supreme Court challenge.
"They don't have to go down the legislative road to defund Obamacare at this point because it didn't work," Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said.
Meanwhile, 53% say it's too soon to tell if the law will be successful.
But that aspect of the party might not be pleased with their decision to stop trying to repeal the law.
"Republicans can still say defunding or replacing Obamacare," he said, adding that they can point to the dozens of votes taken to repeal it in the past.
Repeal isn't going to be possible until "after the 2014 elections," Bonjean said, hoping that Republicans maintain their majority in the House and gain a majority in the Senate.
"If the positive stories begin to sell, then you won't get wholesale changes," Tanner said.
