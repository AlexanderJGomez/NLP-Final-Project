The Transportation Security Administration says the so-called backscatter scans, which emit a small amount of radiation, are safe.
"I'm a doctor at M.D.
Anderson, and I don't want radiation if I can avoid it," he said.
I decided to opt out, too.
I started, of course, with my colleague Dr. Sanjay Gupta, a neurosurgeon, who told me he hasn't opted out thus far.
"I go through them," said Dr. Greg Zorman, chief of neurosurgery at Memorial Healthcare System in Florida.
David Brenner, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University, says he thinks the exposure to radiation is actually 10 times more than what the manufacturers claim.
He says as a frequent flier, he's concerned about the cumulative effect of the radiation.
"We were told then that they were safe, and they were not."
"There is really no absolutely safe dose of radiation," says Kim, chair of the department of neurosurgery at the University of Texas Medical School.
"Cancer risks correlate with that number, so no dose of radiation is too small to matter."
"If we can avoid a little radiation in exchange for the two extra minutes needed for a pat-down, then we will," he says.
