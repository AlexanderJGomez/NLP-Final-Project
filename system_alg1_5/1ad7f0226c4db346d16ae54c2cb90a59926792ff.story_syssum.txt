"He's my sort of man," Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone says of Russian president Vladimir Putin's influence in the project to stage the nation's first grand prix this October in Sochi.
"He's been following the plans all of the way through," Ecclestone says of Putin's involvement.
F1 is a world championship, so it's difficult to think of leaving Russia out of a world event like this," Ecclestone said.
"Originally we had an idea to build the track through the main Fisht Stadium," Oleg Zabara, promoter of the Sochi Grand Prix, told CNN from his office in the paddock area of the newly-built pit lane compound.
"I've had more meetings about Sochi than any other track," the architect says.
But I'm not worried about the cost only about the quality," Zabara says.
"It's also suitable to use the track throughout the season -- we've signed contracts with GP2, GP3, the Porsche Cup and hope to attract MotoGP," adds Zabara, a fan of motorcycling star Valentino Rossi.
Maybe the same will soon be said of the Sochi Grand Prix.
