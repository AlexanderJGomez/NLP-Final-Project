The IRS is trying to reach people who do not normally file tax returns so they can apply for stimulus checks.
In all, the IRS has sent out more than 76 million stimulus checks, in amounts up to $600 for individuals, $1,200 for married couples and $300 per child for families.
"The numbers are staggering," he said.
To receive a stimulus check, people had to file a 2007 return.
