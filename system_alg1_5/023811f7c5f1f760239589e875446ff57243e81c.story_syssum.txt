Many people in his family -- aunts, uncles and grandparents --suffered from diabetes, high cholesterol, heart disease and high blood pressure.
And in 15 months, he dropped 177 pounds, more than 40 percent of his body weight.
Schmitt focused on moving more, too.
"At first I was in disbelief that I finished, and then I was relieved and proud of myself for achieving a difficult goal," he said.
"It's everyday choices like these that help me lose weight," he added.
Schmitt's family doctor, Dr. Michael Allen, said he was comfortable with the pace of the weight loss, since he was a young male and didn't have  major health issues, beyond his high blood pressure.
"They encouraged me to keep going," he said.
Schmitt's goal of starting his own family is on track, too.
