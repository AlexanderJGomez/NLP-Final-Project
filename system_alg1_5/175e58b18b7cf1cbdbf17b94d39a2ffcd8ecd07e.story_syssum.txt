BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- The U.S. State Department's renewal of Blackwater's contract to provide security in Iraq "is bad news," an adviser to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said.
"The U.S. government has the right to choose what contractors it chooses, but Iraq should also have the right to allow or ban certain contractors from operating on its territory," he said.
As a result, a State Department security officer accompanies every convoy manned by contractors, Al-Dabbagh said, and every vehicle is outfitted with a security camera.
"Most importantly, the Iraqi investigation concluded that Blackwater committed a crime at Nusour Square," he said.
Blackwater must work under the rules of the Iraqi government, he said.
Starr said the U.S. government, in particular U.S.
"I am up to this point very satisfied with the changes we have seen," Starr said.
Blackwater spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell declined to comment, referring all questions to the State Department.
