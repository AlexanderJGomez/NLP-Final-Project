(CNN) -- Andre and Korisha Shipley were still mourning the death of their 17-year-old son, Jesse, when two months after his funeral, they received shocking news from students of the same Staten Island, New York, high school Jesse had attended.
In this case, it was a little more than that," Andre Shipley says.
"To say someone died of a motor vehicle accident, doesn't really tell us anything," Weedn explains.
Others, such as University of Pennsylvania medical ethicist Art Caplan, disagree.
According to the form, the consenter authorizes "the removal, examination, and retention of organs....as the pathologists deem proper for diagnostic, education, quality improvement and research purposes."
However, the form also states that "organs and tissues not needed for diagnostic, education, quality improvement, or research purposes will be sent to the funeral home or disposed of appropriately."
Still, Weedn says, in some circumstances it is not beneficial to ask family, because the person of you ask permission could potentially be connected to the cause of death.
"It's all about trust," says Rebecca Skloot, author of the book, "The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks," which explores the history of tissue research in the United States.
The Shipleys' attorney, Marvin Ben Aron, says not only the brain, but parts of the liver and testes were later returned and buried in a small casket with their son's body.
"For them, whenever they remember their child, part of their memory is holding a jar of organs in their hands that they never should have known existed," he explains.
