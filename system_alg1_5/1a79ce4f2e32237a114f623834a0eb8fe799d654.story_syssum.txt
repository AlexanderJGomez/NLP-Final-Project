The tour boat had a clean record, said the president of Ride the Ducks, who traveled to Philadelphia from the company's headquarters in Norcross, Georgia.
We've never had a problem with this boat," said Chris Herschend.
"The immediate response was amazing," said U.S. Coast Guard Capt.
While the boat was in the river and waiting for help, it was hit by a barge, he said.
"We want to find out what happened and issue safety regulations so that this does not happen again," said Sumwalt, who is vice chairman of the NTSB.
Asked by reporters Thursday whether the barge was at fault, Herschend said, "I don't want to speculate.
"Our first priority is the people on board," Herschend said.
The boat is upright on the bottom of the river, Blackburn said.
One passenger suffered a broken jaw, Gaitlin said.
We will resume operations shortly."
