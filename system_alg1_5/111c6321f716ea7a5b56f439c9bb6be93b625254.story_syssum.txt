JACKSON, Missouri (CNN) -- Debbie Shank breaks down in tears every time she's told that her 18-year-old son, Jeremy, was killed in Iraq.
After legal fees were paid, $417,000 was placed in a trust to pay for Debbie Shank's long-term care.
The family's attorney, Maurice Graham, said he informed Wal-Mart about the settlement and believed the Shanks would be allowed to keep the money.
"We assumed after three years, they [Wal-Mart] had made a decision to let Debbie Shank use this money for what it was intended to," Graham said.
Wal-Mart spokesman John Simley, who called Debbie Shank's case "unbelievably sad," replied in a statement: "Wal-Mart's plan is bound by very specific rules.
The family's situation is so dire that last year Jim Shank divorced Debbie, so she could receive more money from Medicaid.
"The recovery that Debbie Shank made was recovery for future lost earnings, for her pain and suffering," Graham said.
Graham said he believes Wal-Mart should be entitled to only about $100,000.
For now, he said the family will figure out a way to get by and "do the best we can for Debbie."
"Luckily, she's oblivious to everything," he said.
