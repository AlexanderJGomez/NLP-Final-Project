Situated roughly 350 miles off the west coast of Africa, Cape Verde has long been a mesh of cultures, history and races.
The economic potential of music has been also acknowledged  by Cape Verde's prime minister, Jose Maria Neves, while the country's ministry of culture is run by Mario Lucio de Sousa, himself a popular musician.
"The future of our country lies in our capacity to create, our capacity to innovate," Neves said in reference to the music and the arts at a World Trade Organization conference in 2013.
"We breathe the music in Cape Verde, we live with the music," he added.
It's a lucrative trade, for sure.
"We try to invite lots of producers and a lot of journalists from around the world to see the festival and the musicians from Cape Verde," said Jose Da Silva, long time manager of the late Cape Verdean songstress Cesaria Evora.
"Economically it's beneficial for the country because the money we would have to spend on the market to give the country this exposure in the world would be too big," Da Silva said.
It must be noted, however, that few countries have the same natural resources for music as Cape Verde.
