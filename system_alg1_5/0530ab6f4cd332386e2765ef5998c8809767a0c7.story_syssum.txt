This means the public discussion of gay rights and relationships, anywhere children might hear it, is prohibited.
"The law effectively legalized discrimination against LGBT people and cast them as second-class citizens," it says.
"In other cases, LGBT people described being physically attacked by strangers on the subway, on the street, at nightclubs, and, in one case, at a job interview," its report says.
"One of them said, 'You're nothing but a faggot.
"His injuries were visible -- there was significant bruising on his forehead, there were bruises under his eyes, and one eye was swollen shut," the report says.
"The police officer who took his complaint said to him, 'It's all right, you're gay so it's normal that you were attacked.
We have no criminal penalties," he said.
"All people here have political rights, social rights, rights to employment, and no one should face discrimination," he said.
