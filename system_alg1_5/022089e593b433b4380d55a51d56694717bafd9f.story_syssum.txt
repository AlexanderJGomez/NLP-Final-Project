Training time accounts for the rest of the delay, as the TSA quietly began pilot programs in Boston, Massachusetts, and Las Vegas, Nevada, in August, and rolled the program out nationwide in early November.
Implementation of the pat downs was further delayed because time was needed to train screeners on the new protocols, he said.
I just want to make sure that I have all the facts," Pistole said.
