State television showed the miners leaving the mine, each supported by two rescuers.
Peruvian President Ollanta Humala greeted the miners at the mouth of the mine.
After the rescue, he made a similar argument.
All those miners were rescued, pulled one by one from hundreds of meters beneath the Earth's surface with a specially designed capsule.
