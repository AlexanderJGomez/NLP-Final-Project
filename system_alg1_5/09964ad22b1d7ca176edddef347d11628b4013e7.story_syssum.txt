With relaxing visions of mobile convenience in mind, I thought traveling from London to Rome using only apps would be stress-free and easy, but it didn't quite work out that way.
So far, so good.
Once at Heathrow's Terminal 5, the app still didn't work.
Great, I thought -- I haven't even made it onto the plane and I've failed.
Coming out of arrivals at Rome FCO, I didn't even have to look at my phone as I recognized Fabio, my Uber driver from the photo provided.
I successfully booked the third hotel I tried -- and just when I thought it was too good to be true.
Overall, my apps experience wasn't quite what I expected it to be.
To avoid disappoint and expensive data roaming charges -- in the end I had spent $160 -- I would use apps that are quick and easy.
