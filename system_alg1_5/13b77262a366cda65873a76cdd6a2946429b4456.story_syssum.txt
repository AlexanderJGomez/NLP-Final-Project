Like a monster that refuses to die, Mexico's once-disgraced Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, made a convincing comeback in last weekend's midterm elections.
German Martinez, president of the PAN, resigned this week after taking responsibility for the electoral failures.
In 2000, the PAN's Vicente Fox broke that streak and reintroduced democracy in Mexico.
Still, Calderon's war remains a noble battle for the soul of Mexico.
But it's great news for the Mexican people, even if they don't know it.
Good luck with that, amigos.
And, if the PRI tries to get in the way by, say, limiting the resources to fight the drug war, then Calderon should paint the party as trying to appease the cartels at the expense of Mexico.
Here's its chance.
