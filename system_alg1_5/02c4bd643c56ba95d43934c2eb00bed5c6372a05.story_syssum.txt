ABUSIR, Egypt (CNN) -- Today, I met Cleopatra's lawyer.
She recounted to me that, as a young girl, she listened in on a scholarly discussion in her father's library about Cleopatra.
In short, Martinez believes, Cleopatra was a woman way ahead of her times.
For that reason, she told me, "I want to be Cleopatra's lawyer."
To escape his creditors in Rome, he fled to Greece, where he studied with the philosophers of Athens, before being called to join the Roman legions in the east, then serving under Julius Caesar.
Shortly afterward, Antony and Cleopatra committed suicide, he by his own sword, she by a poisonous asp.
Researchers from Newcastle University in England claimed in 2007 that, based upon coins found from the period, she was quite homely, with "a shallow forehead, long, pointed nose, narrow lips and a sharply pointed chin."
At Abusir, he showed me one of the coins with Cleopatra's likeness.
In other words, she was plain.
Plutarch goes on to write, however, that she was intelligent, charming and has "sweetness in the tones of her voice."
Why were they built?
Alas, the enthusiasts are going to have to be patient.
I guess we can wait a few more months.
