Rihanna was allegedly attacked by her boyfriend, singer Chris Brown, before the Grammys on February 8.
"The unauthorized release of a domestic violence photograph immediately generated an internal investigation," an L.A. police spokesman said in a statement.
Brown apologized for the incident this week.
"I am seeking the counseling of my pastor, my mother and other loved ones and I am committed, with God's help, to emerging a better person."
