Kasab is also accused of shooting down people at Mumbai's Cama hospital.
Kasab is one of 10 Pakistani nationals who police say reigned down terror on Mumbai, India's financial capital, for four days and three nights.
Late in the day Kasab's newly appointed defense attorney Abbas Kazmi said Kasab was now retracting his statements, saying he confessed under police pressure.
The prosecutor put Kasab's age at 21.
She also said she was unaware that he was listed as a witness in Kasab's trial.
