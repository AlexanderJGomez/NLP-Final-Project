"Ike is an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane" with 135-mph  sustained winds, the center said in its 11 p.m.
"It is too early to determine what, if any, land areas might be affected by Ike," the hurricane center said.
But before Ike can reach into the Caribbean or threaten Florida, Tropical Storm Hanna was getting more organized in the Bahamas, according to the hurricane center.
More rainfall, up to 15 inches in some places, was possible in the Caribbean, the hurricane center said.
Florida could begin seeing rainfall from Hanna on Friday, forecasters said.
In line behind Ike in the Atlantic is Tropical Storm Josephine, with top winds near 50 mph, the hurricane center said.
Josephine was about 425 miles west of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands off western Africa.
