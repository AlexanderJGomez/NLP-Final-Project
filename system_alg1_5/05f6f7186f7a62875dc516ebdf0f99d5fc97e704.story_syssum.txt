On the campaign trail, the support of tea party groups has helped launch campaigns and is a force candidates ignore at their peril.
"We're not a protest movement anymore; we've morphed into something else," said Matt Kibbe, president of FreedomWorks, which has helped support tea party groups around the country.
The bloc has become so powerful, she said, that a Republican could not win his or her party's nomination without tea party support.
"We're sick and tired of the Republican Party handing us candidates who are not true conservatives," she said.
A Wall Street Journal poll from August found the number of voters with a "very negative" view of the tea party had doubled since January, rising from 15 to 29 percent.
"Ideology always trumps electability in a primary," he said.
"I'm starting to hear for the first time, we've got to be careful about the ideology," he said.
Whatever the outcome, don't count the tea party out, he said.
You cannot crush that out given the noise coming out of Washington these days."
