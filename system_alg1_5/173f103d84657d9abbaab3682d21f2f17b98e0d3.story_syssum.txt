Hong Kong, as anyone who has lived or worked in the city knows, is simultaneously China, and not China.
Compared with China throughout much of the city's modern history, Hong Kong has been a bastion of peace, prosperity and, in the 1960s and 70s, a haven from the horrors of the Cultural Revolution.
Hong Kong's defacto constitution, the Basic Law, states that Hong Kong will co-exist with China as "one country, two systems" for 50 years after the handover of power in 1997.
Beijing, however, has repeatedly reinterpreted the document, and in June of this year released a White Paper reaffirming its "complete jurisdiction" over Hong Kong.
Sometimes the differences are seemingly minor; one prominent, telling example is of a video, shared on social media, of an altercation over a mainland tourist eating noodles on the MTR, Hong Kong's pristine subway system.
"The protesters are unhappy because Hong Kong is becoming more and more like China," Chinese tourist, 24-year old Liujing, from Hainan, told CNN at spillover protests in the Mong Kok region of Kowloon.
"I support them because growing up, we always admired Hong Kong.
For many, it is what sets Hong Kong apart from the mainland and its reputation for honesty is one of the reasons that so many multinationals have based their regional headquarters in the city.
China's oft-touted economic miracle is, at least in part, traceable to Hong Kong's influence.
The rest of China has benefited greatly from Hong Kong's "investment, energy and entrepreneurship," Hong Kong University's Michael Davis, says.
