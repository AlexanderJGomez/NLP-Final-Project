(EW.com) -- James Cameron, in "Avatar," is the one American filmmaker -- at least to my eyes -- who has truly knocked the 3-D ball out of the park.
That, however, is the only time in the movie that Cameron uses 3-D to conjure a comin'-at-ya View-Master effect.
It is also, in my opinion, one of the greatest movies ever made.
That's "Titanic."
Hollywood, after all, has never stopped fingering the rich as villains, and Cameron's portrayal of a gilded class seemed (intentionally) locked in its time.
And by that I don't mean to imply that Cameron, in some mystical way, anticipated the 21st century's most infamous day.
In recent years, a hint of off-putting harshness has crept into Winslet's work (in "Revolutionary Road" and "Mildred Pierce," she did too much gloomy suffering for our sins), but in "Titanic" she plays Rose as a spiky princess, trapped by privilege, who allows herself to melt like a girl and, in doing so, melts her own prison and finds herself as a woman.
Yet there's so much more going on in this movie, with its deftly structured mythological framework, its heart-of-the-ocean timelessness, and -- yes, I'll say it -- its hauntingly gorgeous Gaelic-pop theme music.
To watch "Titanic" again is to do nothing less than enter a movie and come out the other side, with one's spirit feeling just a little bit larger.
