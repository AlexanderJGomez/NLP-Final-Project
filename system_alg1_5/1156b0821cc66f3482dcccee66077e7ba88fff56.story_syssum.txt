Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Egypt's military has started rebuilding a church burned down in an outbreak of unrest between Christian Copts and Muslims, a military official told CNN on Sunday.
A Coptic church in the town of Alexandria was bombed on New Year's Day, killing 23 people.
Also in January, a man was sentenced for his part in an attack on another Coptic church a year ago, Egypt's state-run Al Ahram newspaper reported.
CNN's Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.
