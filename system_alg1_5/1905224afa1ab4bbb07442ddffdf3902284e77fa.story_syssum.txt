"While 60 years later, much of India is in the process of rapid modernization, the police continue to use their old methods," the group said.
"The institutional culture of police practically discourages officers from acting otherwise, failing to give them the resources, training, ethical environment and encouragement to develop professional police tactics," it said.
In the last 60 years or so, they should have come out of it, but this hasn't happened.
Successive governments for decades have failed to deliver on promises to hold the police accountable for abuses and to build professional, rights-respecting police forces, HRW said.
The 118-page report, "Broken System: Dysfunction, Abuse and Impunity in the Indian Police," is based on interviews with more than 80 police officers of varying ranks, 60 people who said they were victims of police abuse, and numerous discussions with experts and civil society activists.
"It's time for the government to stop talking about reform and fix the system," said Brad Adams, HRW's Asia director, in a statement.
