The former Barcelona striker signed with Anzhi, who hail from the war-torn Dagestan region of Russia, on Wednesday from Italian outfit Inter Milan.
"I'm impatient to play the first home game, but most important to take this project from the base and make it big," he said.
"The project is very interesting, money is not so important for me, that's just part of football," Eto'o was quoted as saying.
In a statement on Inter's official web site Eto'o thanked the club and its president, Massimo Moratti, for a "fantastic" two years in Italy.
