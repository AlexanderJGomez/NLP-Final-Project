Holmes appeared like a comic book character: He resembled the Joker, with red-orange hair, similar to the late actor Heath Ledger's portrayal of the villain in an earlier Batman movie, authorities said.
Authorities said he wore body armor and carried several guns, including an AR-15 rifle, with lots of ammo.
Holmes now has a cleaner look, with a mustache, button-down shirt and khaki pants.
If this new image sounds like one of an academician, it may be because Holmes, now 27, once was one.
They are 19 women and five men, and almost all are white and middle-aged.
Holmes also has a sister, Chris, a musician, who's five years younger, the newspaper said.
He entered the University of California, Riverside, in 2006 as a scholarship student.
"Academically, he was at the top of the top," Chancellor Timothy P. White said.
The doctoral in neuroscience program attended by Holmes focuses on how the brain works, with an emphasis on processing of information, behavior, learning and memory.
Holmes was "denied access to the school after June 12, 2012, after he made threats to a professor," according to court documents.
Holmes began to fantasize about killing "a lot of people" in early June, nearly six weeks before the shootings, the station reported, citing unidentified sources familiar with the investigation.
In the months before the shooting, he bought four weapons and more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition, authorities said.
Nine minutes before Holmes went into the movie theater, he called a University of Colorado switchboard, public defender Brady has said in court.
No, he had two months left on his lease, Holmes wrote back, according to the Times.
"It was," Holmes wrote her, according to the Times.
For Holmes, "justice is death," said Brauchler, the district attorney.
