In the letter, the FTC also criticized a major ICANN initiative that would let Internet users run their own domain-name extensions, to accompany .com, .org and others.
There are several other governmental gatekeepers for the Web, but ICANN gets the most attention, and ire.
Another ongoing controversy, the .XXX extension for porn sites, was initially resisted by ICANN's board of directors.
ICANN, based near Los Angeles in Marina del Rey, California, was once closely tied to the U.S. government.
As Internet access begins to reach practically every part of the world through the proliferation of smartphones, the network is at risk of being pulled in many different directions -- or splintering, as it has behind China's Great Firewall.
"ICANN stays neutral, and it has to keep running," Beckstrom said in a recent interview from his office here in Silicon Valley.
"ICANN's role in all of this is very restricted, but we often get looked at as the center of these things," Crocker said.
"If we did, that would create more problems."
The Internet has an effective system of checks and balances, said John Curran, the president and CEO of the American Registry for Internet Numbers.
Vint Cerf, a sage-like founding father of the Internet, has discovered ways to continue contributing to Internet governance since stepping down as ICANN chairman in 2007.
"The Internet doesn't just happen," Cerf said by phone.
Cerf said he believes governmental organizations, like ICANN, will need to continue to adapt.
As new demands and stakeholders emerge, the Internet and its stewards will find obstacles, whether it's an overzealous government or the speed of light.
