(CNN) -- The Department of Energy is putting federal money behind the development of small-scale nuclear reactors that supporters say are cheaper, safer and easier to build, though the design still needs federal approval.
They could run longer on the same nuclear fuel, and additional reactors could be added in a "plug and play" fashion, said Paul Genoa of the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry's trade association.
But the designs are still under review by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, whose approval is the worldwide "gold seal," Genoa said.
The new designs are "orders of magnitude safer" than existing plants, "and we believe those plants are safe," he said.
"The SMRs are without a doubt going to be more expensive than even large reactors," he said.
"It's important to understand that these designs are in the early stage -- at best 20% to 30% complete," he said.
