Stine, 70, is the author of more than 300 novels for children and teens, including the much-loved "Goosebumps" and "Fear Street" series.
"The whole thing happened because of Twitter," Stine said.
Popular shows such as "The Walking Dead" and "American Horror Story" helped revive interest in horror literature, said Catherine Scully, young adult editor for the Horror Writers Association.
Unlike horror depicted on television and the big screen, in horror literature for young adults, subtlety is key, rather than shock value, author and horror expert Jonathan Maberry said.
Horror is defined by what scares you, "and that's very personal and different for each person," said Scully, who reviews young adult horror in HWA's 'Scary Out There' blog.
In the early 2000s, authors began began weaving elements of horror into fantasy, such as the "Harry Potter" series.
"Horror combines what readers love by merging the scary creatures from 'Twilight' and gritty, horrifying elements of dystopian (literature)," gothic horror author Winters said.
Isaac Marion, author of "Warm Bodies," which was adapted for the big screen in February 2013, didn't write his book for young adults.
For years, fans have been asking Stine to revive "Fear Street" in online fan forums and over social media.
That's why they were so popular with young readers, Brzozowski said, including herself.
"For me, it's thinking of new scares, plot twists and cliffhanger chapter endings I haven't done before, moving into the modern world," Stine said.
