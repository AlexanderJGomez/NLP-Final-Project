Goalkeeper Alyaksandr Gutor gifted Barca their third, dropping Pedro's cross onto Messi's head for the Argentine's first goal of the night, while Messi added his second soon after the interval -- firing home after exchanging passes with Alves.
Barcelona are level on four points with Milan at the top of the group, after the Italian champions saw off Czech side Viktoria Plzen 2-0 at the San Siro.
But, just three minutes from time, Roberto Soldado levelled from the spot after substitute Salomon Kalou handled a cross in the area.
Arsenal are second in the table with four points, two behind French champions Marseille, who lead the way with a maximum six points after cruising to a 3-0 home win over Borussia Dortmund.
Ayew added his second, and Marseille's third, seven minutes later, converting from the penalty spot after Remy had been bundled to the ground by Dortmund captain Sebastian Kehl.
However, surprise leaders of the group after two matches are Cypriot side APOEL Nicosia, who drew 1-1 at last season's quarterfinalists Shakhtar Donetsk.
