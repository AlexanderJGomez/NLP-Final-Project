(CNN) -- Frankel and Black Caviar.
"Frankel will have the pick of the best mares when it is time for him to stud, and there is no mare out there at the moment attracting as much attention as Black Caviar," says Johnny McKeever, who has 25 years of experience in buying horses which have gone on to win major Group One meets around the world.
"Sea The Stars commanded a $133,000 fee at the start, so it is not impossible that Frankel's first valuation will be around $155,000 and that may be a touch on the conservative side," McKeever said.
But Frankel's achievements in racing, coupled with his bloodline, means he would be more likely to sire a good racing performer."
"Ever since he was a three-year-old, Frankel has seemed determined to get better and better," Timeform's flat racing editor David Johnson told CNN.
Black Caviar, who turns six this month, may be retiring at roughly the same time.
However, that may be just for the first crop of the next generation, and they may be happy to let Frankel go to stud elsewhere later on in his career.
"At the end of the day there is no guarantee that Frankel and Black Caviar will take to each other.
