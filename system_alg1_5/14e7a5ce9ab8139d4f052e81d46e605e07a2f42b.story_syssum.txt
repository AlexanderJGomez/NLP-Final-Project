Coots was a third-generation "serpent handler" and aspired to one day pass the practice and his church, Full Gospel Tabernacle in Jesus Name, on to his adult son, Little Cody.
"Even after losing half of his finger to a snake bite and seeing others die from bites during services," Coots "still believes he must take up serpents and follow the Holiness faith," the website says.
In February 2013, Coots was given one year of probation for crossing into Tennessee with venomous snakes.
"He'll give up, just sooner or later," one of the members says.
"Catching two snakes the first day, 'course we'd hoped for more," Coots says in the video.
