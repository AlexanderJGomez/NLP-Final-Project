(Mashable.com) -- Facebook has begun the rollout of a new feature, Facebook Questions, which will allow users to get answers to their queries from the entire Facebook community.
• Photo questions: For example, if you take a picture of a bird, but don't know what species it is, you can post the picture on Facebook Questions and get your answer.
• Topic exploration: Facebook described this as a roulette-type feature that allows users to browse Facebook's eventual mountain of Q&A.
There was one more thing that Facebook made clear to me: Facebook Questions is not an advertising product.
The entire feature is public, so we don't suggest posting those awkward bedroom questions on Facebook.
