Many al Qaeda sympathizers and members took refuge in Iran in the aftermath of the post 9/11 invasion of Afghanistan, including one son of Osama bin Laden, Saad bin Laden, and a son-in-law, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith.
But Iran has become increasingly hostile to al Qaeda as it has become a Sunni sectarian group, especially in Iraq and Syria, as much as an anti-western outfit.
"I worry about the vulnerability of mass transit because we know they've been on al Qaeda's radar screen," Robert Liscouski, a former director of infrastructure protection at the Department of Homeland Security, told CNN.
Documents recovered from his compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan revealed that early in 2010, al Qaeda had discussed an idea to derail a train in the United States, several U.S. officials told CNN.

The plot was abandoned after the terrorists realized they had been spotted by nearby workers, who alerted police, a Spanish official told CNN.
On July 7, 2005, al Qaeda suicide bombers killed dozens on the London underground system.
