Fish canning factory Conserveira do Sul, is in many ways, an example of Portugal's economic successes and failures.
As I get a tour of the factory, one of its co-owners, Jorge Ferreira, tells me the company has been in "pre-alert crisis since the 1970s"-- a time when the canned fish sector went into a deep crisis and many factories closed.
To secure these key distribution deals, Jorge tells me he shows off the factory -- the canning process, the sterilization of the product and the fresh fish itself, which arrives at the port just outside the factory door -- to Chinese distributors.
She has been cleaning, gutting and canning fish since she was 13.
While those traditional exports of fish and olive oil offered a ray of hope in the second quarter, they were not the country's saving grace, with some arguing the numbers were simply an anomaly.
There is no doubt that there's an improvement in the Portuguese economy.
For now, pate and bread may be the most appropriate economic aperitif.
