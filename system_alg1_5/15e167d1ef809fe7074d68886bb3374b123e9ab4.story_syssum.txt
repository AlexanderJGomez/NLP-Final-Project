The 75 soldiers were identified by name, Australian defense officials said Wednesday.
DNA was key to identifying the soldiers, but historical, anthropological, and artifact evidence was also used, he said.
"All but one of the soldiers have been reburied in individual graves in the purpose-built Fromelles (Pheasant Wood) Military Cemetery," said Alan Griffin, Australia's minister for veterans affairs.
"The new cemetery is a fitting resting place for these brave men, who made the ultimate sacrifice," he added.
Private Henry Alfred Cressy, from New South Wales, of the 54th Battalion, sits for a portrait while wearing his military uniform.
But that's only half as many as the experts need, he said, since about 1,600 Commonwealth dead from the battle remain unaccounted for.
A full list of the soldiers identified and also their photos is available on the Australian Department of Defence Web site.
