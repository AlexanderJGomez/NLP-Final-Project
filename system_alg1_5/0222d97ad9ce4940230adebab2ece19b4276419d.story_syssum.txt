Called HP ePrint, the technology eliminates the need for installing drivers and enables a variety of new apps and services.
Similarly, Box.net and Docstoc users can also retrieve and push documents to and from the cloud through new print apps.
MSNBC has signed on as a partner to pilot this concept, and HP has teamed with Yahoo to sell the ads, which, you can imagine could include a mix of contextual advertising and locally relevant promotions and coupons.
Beyond selling printers, HP needs to sell ink.
Finally, there's also opportunities for developers to create sticky apps -- perhaps not on the scale we've seen in mobile, but with HP betting the future of its printers on web connectivity, you can bet we'll see some big winners emerge from the developer community.
