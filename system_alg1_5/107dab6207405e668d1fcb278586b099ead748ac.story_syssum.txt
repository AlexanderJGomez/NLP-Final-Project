Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Ali Abdullah Saleh is no longer Yemen's president, but he is still wielding political clout as the head of the ruling party.
"Saleh informed the prime minister to take orders from him or else he will take him to prison," the aide said.
Saleh threatened to withdraw all members of his party from the national government to protest the way Hadi's administration is dealing with the political crisis in the country, embroiled in discord and violence.
Saleh is still the president of the largest party in the country and must be treated with respect," said a senior GPC aide who asked to remain anonymous.
Mohammed Qahtan, a senior opposition Joint Meeting Parties official, said it's sad that Saleh's GPC officials are remaining quiet about Saleh's maneuverings.
