In the final days of winter, when snow coats the surrounding peaks, the caves look all but deserted.
The well is called "Tamar's Tears," after Queen Tamar, who completed construction of Vardzia eight centuries ago after the death of her father King Giorgi.
"It puts joy in my heart to live here," the priest says, as he looks out of the doorway of his incense-scented cave at the rushing river below, where he sometimes fishes for trout.
In fact, Father Lazar says aside from the monks, the only other people who live in this valley, are the nuns who inhabit a small convent beyond a bend in the river.
"For the priests, it is not very good because they make a lot of noise," Father Lazar says.
"Visitors to Georgia are going to Vardzia and there is no infrastructure there at all," says Tengiz Bendukidze, an executive with Rakeen, an Emirati real estate development company.
"During the Soviet era, Georgia was the number one tourist attraction for almost all the Soviet Union," said Nika Gilauri, the prime minister of Georgia, in an interview with CNN.
"It's a bad idea to build a big hotel right there, directly across from Vardzia," he says.
But, he concedes, the tourists will probably appreciate the view.
