Focus is now on the Nigeria's list of problems in the North: kidnappings, terrorist attacks and killings.
But Nigeria does have a couple of obvious economic black-eyes, most notably an inability to close the wealth gap between the North and South, which in turn has given fuel to the Boko Haram movement and, by extension, radical Islam.
In the political capital of Abuja, where the economic forum is taking place, it rises to $4,000.
In Borno, alarmingly, 60% of the population lives in extreme poverty, according to the Nigeria Security Tracker.
South Africa also struggles with less than a third of Nigeria's growth.
At 37 billion barrels, the country is ranked second on the continent behind Libya.
That is where Nigeria remains vulnerable.
