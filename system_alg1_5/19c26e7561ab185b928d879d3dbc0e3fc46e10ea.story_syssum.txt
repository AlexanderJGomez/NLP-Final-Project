Our president has spent one-third of his entire two terms in office either at Camp David, Maryland, or at Crawford, Texas, on vacation.
Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, at Messiah College in Pennsylvania, McCain didn't bother to show up.
Now I know why.
Asked about his greatest moral failure, he cited his first marriage, which ended in divorce.
He was asked "if evil exists."
That was it.
Where are his position papers setting forth his careful consideration of foreign policy, the welfare state, education, America's moral responsibility in the world, etc., etc., etc.
His academic record was awful.
Unless he's reciting talking points or reading from notes or a TelePrompTer, John McCain is lost.
I fear to the depth of my being that John McCain is just like him.
