But reading about Emily Bauer, a Texas high school student left brain-damaged after smoking "potpourri" she bought at a convenience store, really put him in her parents' shoes.
"I am a sucker for my little girl, so I know how I would feel in their place."
"The story points to another example of people who shouldn't be allowed to be parents," wrote Lynn DeArmond, who added she was thankful Emily is recovering.
"Honestly, if my child was seriously showing signs of wanting to smoke pot, or even just try it, I'd probably buy it for them myself and make them do it at home, in a safe environment, just to make sure they're responsible," commenter Rob Doerr wrote.
"I don't wish this upon anybody," he said.
"I think back to all the fond memories I have of her, then I realize that somehow, I got another chance to make more," he said on Wednesday.
Why or why not?
