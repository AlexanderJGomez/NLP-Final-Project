Washington (CNN) -- The sweeping health care reform law championed by President Barack Obama was upheld as constitutional by another federal appeals court Tuesday.
Three appeals court have upheld the law, while one has ruled it unconstitutional.
A federal appeals court in Atlanta, considering that suit, had earlier found a key provision of the law to be unconstitutional.
Virginia and Oklahoma have filed separate challenges, along with other groups and individuals opposed to the law.
Health care reform, a top Democratic priority since the Truman administration, was passed by the previous Congress in a series of virtually party-line votes.
Republican leaders, who captured the House of Representatives in the midterm elections, have vowed to overturn or severely trim the law.
