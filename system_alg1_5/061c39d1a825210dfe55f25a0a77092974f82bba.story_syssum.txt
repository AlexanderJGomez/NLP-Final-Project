Three suspects, one of them wounded, were in custody, said Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesman John Bankhead.
The corporal was wounded by gunfire.
The injured suspect was taken to the same hospital and underwent surgery, Bankhead said.
One of the suspects has an uspecified outstanding warrant in Fayette County, south of Atlanta, the GBI said.
