Here on this Caribbean island, and on the others that make up what's known as the West Indies, life revolves around one thing -- cricket.
In 1983, the West Indies cricket team was on top of the world.
At the same time, a world away, South Africa was deep in the heart of apartheid.
As the world tried to pressure South Africa's leadership, sanctions were applied, and sport was no exception.
So, in secret, they began planning "rebel tours" -- inviting various teams from around the world.
"From our point of view, we knew we had the best cricketers in the world," said former South African Cricket Union president Joe Pamensky, one of the rebel tour organizers.
But other players were tempted.
"And I said to myself, 'Well, cricket is my job.
And that's why I went."
"When we got to South Africa, I realized that separation, and it wasn't only black and white," he said.
"We packed them in," said Murray.
"For the first time, they were seeing blacks beating whites," said newspaper writer Al Gilkes, the only journalist from the Caribbean to go to South Africa.
To me, that was where the real victory was."
Back home in the Caribbean, the reaction was worse.
Murray, once a star, is now drifting, unable to hold a job in Barbados.
"They didn't want me to return," Murray said.
For Stephenson, the once-rising star, his cricketing past is behind him.
"Nobody looked out for us," Stephenson said.
"I know I went there as a missionary," King said.
Stephenson asked.
So if that's being a mercenary, then yes I was."
