(CNN) -- President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan will attend the NATO summit meeting about Afghanistan in Chicago this weekend, his office said in a statement Thursday.
But Farhatullah Babar, a spokesman for Zardari, said Tuesday that the invitation to the meeting was unconditional and was not linked to the opening of ground lines of communication for NATO or to any other issue.
"It doesn't necessarily impact what we do with the Pakistanis" at the summit, the official said.
"Remember, we need to crack down on these extremists for Pakistan's sake.
But we will still be haunted by the remnants," he said.
