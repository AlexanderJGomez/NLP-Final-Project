(CNN) -- A 56-year-old married woman has won half of the second-largest Mega Millions jackpot in U.S. history and has taken the cash option, which after taxes, will be about $120 million, Georgia Lottery President Debbie Alford said Wednesday.
Curry bought her winning ticket in Atlanta at a Gateway Newstand in the lobby of an office building near the city's Buckhead community; the other ticket was sold in San Jose, California, lottery officials said.
"(Curry) had the radio on, and the announcer was talking about the Mega ball, which was seven," Alford said.
The winning numbers were 8, 14, 17, 20 and 39, with a Mega ball of 7.
The California winning ticket was sold at Jenny's Gift Shop in a San Jose strip mall, lottery officials said.
The odds of hitting the jackpot, which were 1 in 176 million, are now 1 in 259 million.
Mega Millions tickets are sold in 43 states -- all but Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Mississippi, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming -- plus the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
