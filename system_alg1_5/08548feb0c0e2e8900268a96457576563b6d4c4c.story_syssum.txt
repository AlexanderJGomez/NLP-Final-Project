A chilly breeze, southwest California.
"It's more the tourists coming into the area, even from Southern California, who aren't used to this kind of heat."
Many of the excessive heat warnings issued by the National Weather Service extend through Tuesday night, with advisories from northern California, including Sacramento, all the way to southern Arizona.
It's not like sunset will provide much respite, as temperatures may not drop below 90 degrees in many places, even in the middle of the night.
Of course, there will be those who don't do that -- perhaps because they have to be outside, or maybe because they're convinced they can beat the heat.
But the weather wasn't, and won't, be much help at all: Forecasts for the area call for sunny skies and temperatures topping out at 109 degrees both days this weekend.
"If your body says, 'I don't feel good, I don't feel right,' go inside, get some shade, get some water."
