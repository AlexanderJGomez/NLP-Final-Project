(CNN) -- The death of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who was killed Thursday in his hometown of Sirte, Libya, is "an important step" for Libya, but don't expect the fighting to end right away, said CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman.
So it's a bit of a surprise the way he, in theory, met his end.
Let's not forget that Baghdad, for instance, in the case of Iraq, it fell in late April (2003) (and) Saddam Hussein was not caught until December of 2003.
There's a worry that there's going to be a lot of revenge, a lot of, basically, lawlessness.
Yes, it's an important step along the way, but the killing of Moammar Gadhafi certainly doesn't mean that it's going to be smooth sailing.
But no, just because Moammar Gadhafi is gone -- we believe -- doesn't mean things are going to be rosy from here on in.
