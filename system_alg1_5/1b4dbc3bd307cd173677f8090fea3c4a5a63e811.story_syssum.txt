Chantal Ka-Hor-Rury, a coffee trader and head of a collective that helps farmers bring their crop to market, is committed to helping Burundi expand its coffee industry.
"We chose to cultivate coffee because in our country, it's a crop that gives a lot of money," she said.
Today, Burundi's coffee producers are trying to transform the country's fortunes, with farmers harboring ambitions to process coffee domestically.
"Coffee comes from Africa so it should be able to produce the best coffee in terms of the characteristics of the bean," he said.
However, he expressed a positive outlook for the future of African coffee producers by adding: "It's only recently that we've seen the comeback of African countries, so I think there is hope, no doubt.
