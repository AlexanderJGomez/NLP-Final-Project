Former White House spokesman Scott McClellan blasts President Bush and advisers in a new book.
"Scott, we now know, is disgruntled about his experience at the White House," Perino said.
"Scott never did that on any of these issues as best I can remember or as best as I know from any of my White House colleagues," said Townsend, now a CNN contributor.
"They're saying some of the exact same things about McClellan they said about me," Richard Clarke, the former White House counterterrorism chief, told CNN.
It's a little different when you say something as I did and a few other people did four or five years ago, when the war was popular and when we were unpopular for saying what we said."
Early in the book, which CNN obtained late Tuesday, McClellan wrote that he believes he told untruths on Bush's behalf in the case of CIA agent Valerie Plame, whose identity was leaked to the media.
At the time, McClellan called the three "good individuals" and said he spoke to them before telling reporters they were not involved.
A former spokesman for Bush when he was governor of Texas, McClellan was named White House press secretary in 2003, replacing Ari Fleischer.
"And I can assure you, I will feel the same way then that I feel now, that I can say to Scott, job well done."
