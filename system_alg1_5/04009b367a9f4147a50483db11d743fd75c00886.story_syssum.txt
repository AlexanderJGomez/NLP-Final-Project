But this year is not normal.
What's going on here?
--In the eastern Atlantic, where hurricanes are often born, African desert air is drying the moisture that hurricanes need to form.
"The forecast up to now is a bust," says Gray.
"Our forecast remains the same," weather service spokesman Chris Vaccaro said.
"In some ways we're ahead of schedule," says Vaccaro.
"Historically speaking, June and July and the first part of August are typically fairly quiet," he says.
September, he warns, is the time when storms can start to get get serious.
-In 2002, Gustav, the first hurricane of the season, didn't occur until September.
In this crazy year, it's anybody's guess.
--This year there is no El Niño, which would keep the season quiet, or La Niña, which would fuel a more active season.
As you might expect, opinions differ.
"There are mixed signals," says Vaccaro.
"If one gets to you, it's a bad year."
"We'll figure it out," says Gray.
