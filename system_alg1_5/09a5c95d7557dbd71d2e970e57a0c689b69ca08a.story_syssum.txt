The alerts about a blue Nissan -- possibly carrying Ethan Anderson, 8, and sister Hannah Anderson, 16 -- were the first sent statewide in California under a new program that sends Amber Alerts about abducted children via text messages to millions of mobile phones.
Marc Klaas, whose daughter Polly was kidnapped from her California home in 1993 and later found dead, was an unlikely critic of Monday's statewide alerts, telling CNN that while the messages were well intended, their rollout was "pretty abysmal."
Cellphone owners now receive Amber Alerts, as well as emergency weather alerts, based on their proximity to the emergency, not the location of their phone number.
Carriers representing 98% of all U.S. wireless subscribers are on the new program, and more than 200 models of phones support the alerts, said Brian Josef, an assistant vice president for regulatory affairs at CTIA, the wireless industry trade association.
"We have stressed that these alerts have been used judiciously, sparingly," he added, when asked about irritated reactions to Monday's Amber Alerts in California.
A massive manhunt was under way Tuesday and Wednesday in California for James DiMaggio, 40, whom law enforcement authorities describe as a friend of the children's mother, Christina Anderson.
"The fact that the alerts were broadcast indiscriminately to San Diego-area cellphones (and later, to all California phones capable of receiving text messages, as the alert went statewide) clearly annoyed a lot of wireless customers," he wrote.
