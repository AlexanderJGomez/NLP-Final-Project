The flames spread to hull of the nuclear submarine Yekaterinburg, where work had been underway.
"There is no possibility of fire burning through the hull, and no threat to on-board equipment," Sega said Thursday, according to RIA-Novosti.
The nuclear sub, itself, was partially submerged to minimize damage.
According to the military research website RusNavy.com, the vessel was launched in September 1984, has two nuclear reactors and can carry a 140-person crew.
