In an interview that aired Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press," Obama said he "should have anticipated the optics" because "part of the job is the theater of it," conceding "it's not something that comes naturally" to him.
The President said he understands "optics" is important.
At the same time, Obama conceded that the "theater" of the presidency is a challenge for him.
"There are days where I'm not getting enough sleep, because we've got a lot on our plate," he said.
