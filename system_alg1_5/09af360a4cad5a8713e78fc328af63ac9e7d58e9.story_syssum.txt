Smart, now 25 and married, spoke to CNN's Anderson Cooper Monday about her book "My Story," which she said tells 100% of what happened to her.
"To me, in my bedroom is the ultimate place in safety," she said.
"He said 'I have a knife at your neck, don't make a sound, get up and come with me,'" Smart told Cooper.
"I kept looking, I kept waiting for something to happen, for some way for me to get away," she said.
because, in my mind, I wanted my parents to know what had happened to me," she said.
"I remember he just looked back at me and said, 'Oh, I'm not going to rape and kill you yet.'
I mean, if hugs could speak this hug would have said, 'You're mine, you will do exactly what I tell you to do.'"
I mean, not just once, multiple times a day."
"Every time I thought 'OK, this is rock bottom,' I mean, my pajamas have been taken away from me and I'm being forced to wear this nasty robe, the next thing I knew they'd say, 'We're going to have you go naked now,' or I had been forced to drink alcohol, which I had never done before," she told Cooper.
I mean, they just don't know," she said.
And I was 14.
The second half of Smart's interview with Cooper, in which she reveals details of how she was rescued, will air on CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360" Tuesday night.
