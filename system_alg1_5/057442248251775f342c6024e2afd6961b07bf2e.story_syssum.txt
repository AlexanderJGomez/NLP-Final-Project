"There's no likelihood of a Fukushima-like incident here," Nellenbach says.
So does Gary Gates, CEO of the Fort Calhoun plant.
That's where it should be.
The floodwaters are outside Fort Calhoun, not inside," Gates explains.
But outside those barriers, the water is at least 2 feet above ground level.
It was scheduled to be back online in mid-June, according to officials here, but the flooding has delayed that.
Fort Calhoun's safe.
Gates and his colleagues say the water has not breached the buildings housing the reactor core and the spent fuel rods, and they're confident it won't.
Since that time, he says, they've taken steps to upgrade safeguards for the facility, and he says NRC officials were satisfied with the handling of the current flooding.
