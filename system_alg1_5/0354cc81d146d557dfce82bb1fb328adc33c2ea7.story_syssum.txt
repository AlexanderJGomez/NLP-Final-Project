Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said a power outage put city schools, firehouses, police stations, City Hall and Wayne State University in the dark Tuesday morning.
The city website said 740 traffic signals were knocked out, but power was not lost for the 911 system.
As part of the process, the city is getting out of the business of running PLD and the utility corporation DTE Energy is taking over, Duggan said.
"All we know at this point is that the cable went to ground, which means it grounded itself out," said Jerry Norcia, president and chief operating officer for DTE Electric and Gas Storage & Pipelines.
This outage isn't believed to have affected residences, officials said.
"We are back at full power at Joe Louis Arena," he said.
