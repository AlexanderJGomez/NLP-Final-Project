"We still can't get a normal, acceptable response," student leader Joshua Wong, 17, told CNN's Andrew Stevens.
In some minds, this confrontation has been brewing ever since Hong Kong transitioned in 1997 from British to Chinese control.
The activists are open to talks with Chinese or other Hong Kong leaders, but not with Leung, one of the movement's figureheads, Lester Shum, said Wednesday.

"Hong Kong has a long history of managing large protests reasonably well," Richardson said.
"We have to keep it peaceful," she said.
"We want a right that we should enjoy, no more and no less," he said.
"Hong Kong should be stable, everything should be stable.
"The longer it goes on, the longer that these disputes -- that, in some cases, are splitting apart family members and friends -- the worst those relations are going to get," Watson said.
