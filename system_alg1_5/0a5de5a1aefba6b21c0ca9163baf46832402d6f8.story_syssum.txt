Tamir, who had what police said is an air gun that looked like a real firearm, died Sunday, a day after he was shot outside a recreation center.
Authorities are investigating the shooting, and the two officers -- identified Wednesday by police as Timothy Loehmann, 26, and Frank Garmback, 46 -- are on leave from their jobs.
"It is our belief that this situation could have been avoided and that Tamir should still be here with us," the family said.
Eventually, Tamir emerges from the bench and walks to the edge of the gazebo.
"(The officer's) door was open as they pulled up," Tomba said.
The video shows Loehmann, the passenger-side officer, exiting the car, and Tamir falls down, apparently shot.
Investigators determined that Tamir's weapon was an air gun, and that an orange tip that is meant to indicate that it's not a real firearm had been removed, police said.
