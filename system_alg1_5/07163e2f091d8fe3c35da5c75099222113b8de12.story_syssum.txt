In fact, the dispute concerns what Congress meant in just four words in one section of the law.
On March 4, the justices will gather again to hear a challenge to the law, based on the validity of subsidies in the form of tax breaks, that could affect millions of Americans.
In their eyes, the only exchanges that comport with the letter of the law are those established by the states themselves.
But when only a few states acted, the IRS tried to "fix" the law and wrote a rule allowing subsidies for those living in states with state-run exchanges as well as states with federally run exchanges.
"Under those principles, it is clear that the IRS rule must fall," he said.
If the challengers win, individuals living in the 34 states that opted not to establish exchanges would face the loss of their subsidies.
But if the system is destabilized elsewhere, all bets are off.
But in order to bring the challenge, the plaintiffs have to show that they have the "standing" or legal right to be in court.
If they were, they wouldn't have to buy insurance through the exchange.
