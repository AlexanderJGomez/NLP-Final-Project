Officer John Hege was one of four police officers fatally shot Saturday in Oakland, California.
Hege's liver, kidneys and heart were donated, the network said, and the transplants were successfully completed Tuesday and early Wednesday.
The man accused of shooting the officers -- Lovelle Mixon, 26, of Oakland -- was fatally shot in a gun battle with SWAT officers in an apartment complex where he was hiding, police said.
Mark Dunakin, 40, an 18-year veteran of the force.
The gunman fired on SWAT officers who entered the apartment, hitting two of them before police shot and killed the man, Jordan said.
A fifth officer who was grazed by a bullet was treated at a hospital and released, police spokesman Jeff Thomason said Saturday.
