(CNN) -- Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who died Wednesday at 56, made the world "immeasurably better," the company's board of directors said in a statement.
Cook said the company is planning a "celebration of Steve's extraordinary life for Apple employees that will take place soon."
"We love you," one said.
"RIP."
"No words can adequately express our sadness at Steve's death or our gratitude for the opportunity to work with him," Cook told Apple employees.
