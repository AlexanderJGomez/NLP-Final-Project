(CNN) -- The Supreme Court on Monday took away some of the government's power to tighten emission standards, but preserved the majority of its authority under federal law to regulate greenhouse gases.
The court agreed to some extent.
"EPA is getting almost everything it wanted in this case," said Scalia.
The justices in 2007 agreed with EPA and many environmentalists that greenhouse gasses, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions, cause air pollution, but that case dealt with emissions from motor vehicles.
"It is a resounding defeat for those, like the President, who would use unelected bureaucracies to override the will of the people."
Some progressive groups worry the conservative majority Supreme Court has been overly friendly to corporate interests in recent years.
