De Niro and Al Pacino in a scene from their new movie "Righteous Kill," out this fall.

"I love Bob, so it's fun," he told Entertainment Weekly.
Reviews for De Niro in films like "Analyze That," "Hide and Seek" and "Godsend" have been similarly scathing.

"I was astonished because it wasn't true," he said.
