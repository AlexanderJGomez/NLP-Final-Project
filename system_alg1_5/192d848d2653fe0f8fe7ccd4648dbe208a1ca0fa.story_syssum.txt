(CNN) -- Iran is in possession of the building blocks to construct a promising, fast growing, developing economy.
That is the promise, but the reality today with its devalued rial is the polar opposite.
Chicken prices have risen three-fold in the past year, barbari bread a five fold increase.
In 2010, Iran began removing subsidies for fuel, from heating oil to engine petrol, which amounted to $4,000 per year for the average family of four according to the IMF.
All the while, the screws linked to sanctions are being tightened.
With rising import prices due to a plummeting currency, Iran Inc. is also no longer able to compete.
Most candidates, whether moderate or not, are keeping their heads down during this flashpoint of anger being expressed on the streets linked to the falling rial.
