In one sense, it's just walking, but it takes me to new heights, literally.
So far I've accomplished a few major hikes, such as Mount Kilimanjaro, the Inca Trail, and Northern Sikkim.
Because I now have good overall strength and am usually pressed for time, Mary, my trainer, has me doing two-in-one moves that are really wonderful.
I take new routes coming into the city so there's always something novel and interesting to look at -- new architecture, a field, or a reservoir I hadn't seen before.
I do promise, however, to really learn both poker and bridge, and I also promise to one day have some of that elusive downtime we all dream about.
When my mother died, I was astonished by how many people came to her funeral.
They each offered me some little reminiscence of my mom -- stories, insights, and memories.
While on a photo shoot in Palm Springs, California, it was important to me to visit Joshua Tree National Park.
And then, perhaps most important, you move on.
Also, I do not confine my feet.
I like to walk on all different kinds of surfaces, particularly when I hike.
That way, nothing gets forgotten and everything will be done when it should be.
