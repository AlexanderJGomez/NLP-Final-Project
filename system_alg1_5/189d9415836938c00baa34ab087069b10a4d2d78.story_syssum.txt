Neither side wanted to get behind, and in 1959, the Soviet Union was already ahead in the space race -- putting the first unmanned spacecraft on the moon, the Luna 2.
The space around the Earth and moon would be considered a military theater.
With expansion would come lunar nuclear power plants.
And in the end, it wasn't the military, but NASA that sent them there.
The U.S. agencies also documented their space rivalry with the Soviet Union, how U.S. intelligence picked up Soviet anti-ballistic missile radar images, when their signals reflected off the moon.
The purpose of a nuclear detonation near or on the moon would be for show, a document said.
