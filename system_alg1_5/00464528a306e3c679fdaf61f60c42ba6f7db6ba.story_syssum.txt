Abuja, Nigeria (CNN) -- More than 70 members of the Islamist extremist group Boko Haram have been killed during a Nigerian military operation in the northeastern state of Borno, an Army spokesman told CNN on Friday.
By the time that fighting was over, 21 suspected Boko Haram fighters were dead, the government group reported.
Boko Haram, which means "Western education is sacrilege" in the Hausa-Fulani language, seeks to impose a strict version of Sharia law across northeastern Nigeria, if not the entire country.
But the group did not stay down for long, and has remained an active and violent force in Nigeria.
