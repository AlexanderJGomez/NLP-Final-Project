Los Angeles (CNN) -- Broadcast icon Dick Clark, the longtime host of the influential "American Bandstand," has died, publicist Paul Shefrin said.
Clark's "American Bandstand" work, which he began when it was a local TV show in Philadelphia in 1956, earned him the nickname "America's oldest living teenager."
"Only God is responsible for making more stars than Dick Clark," said singer Tony Orlando, who was 16 when he first appeared on Clark's show in 1961.
"He has truly been one of the greatest influences in my life," Seacrest said.
"We just feel that he was one of the most magnanimous human beings that we ever knew in the industry," Jean Kasem said of Clark.
He was, in every sense of the word, a giant."
"This guy was the best," said singer Freddy Cannon, who appeared on "American Bandstand" 110 times.
"The hardest thing in the business is to be yourself, and no one knew that better than Dick Clark," King said.
He was 75.
