But it's anyone's guess what might happen this year, with all teams and drivers grappling with a new car following a complete overhaul of F1's technical regulations.

"The car has some good signs and, let's say, the philosophy that the car has been designed is just what we are seeing now on the data.
"They are ugly, yeah.

"I think we are (all) still in shock, after nearly one month," Alonso said.
Alonso's quest for a third drivers' championship title begins in Melbourne on March 16.
