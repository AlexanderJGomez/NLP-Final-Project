In Greece, Syriza should not even be called a fringe party, though they do occupy a space in the European parliament on the far left.
For the first time in more than a century, a third party In the UK has come in front in a national election.
But unlike many other fringe parties in Europe, UKIP does not have one single seat in Westminster, the national parliament.
The difference this time is perhaps, that the parties have gained more seats.
Geert Wilders' PVV, in the Netherlands, appear to have lost votes, but not seats.
It should also be noted that the far, far right British party, the BNP, lost both of their MEPs and will have none in the new parliament.
Now, it will be up to the centrist parties, in the European Parliament and in national parliaments to cobble together coalitions if they want to thwart the rise of fringe parties.
