Martin's partner of 55 years, Phyllis Lyon, was by her side at the UCSF hospice, the National Center for Lesbian Rights said.
I am so lucky to have known her, loved her and been her partner in all things," Lyon said.
In 1955, the couple founded the nation's first lesbian organization, the Daughters of Bilitis, and launched the first lesbian publication, The Ladder.
"For all of Del's life, she was an activist and organizer even before we knew what those terms meant," Kendell said.
"If we had a secret, we would have written a book and made a million dollars," Lyon told the Voice.
The officials chose Lyon, then 80, and Martin, then 83, to take the first vows.
Lyon and Martin, however, joined more than 20 other couples as plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging the state's marriage laws.
In addition to Lyon, Martin is survived by daughter Kendra Mon, son-in-law Eugene Lane, granddaughter Lorraine Mon, grandson Kevin Mon and sister-in-law Patricia Lyon.
