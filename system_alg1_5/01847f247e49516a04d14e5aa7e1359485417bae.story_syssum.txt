It was Trout's job, as Mason General Hospital's patient navigator, to guide the single mother through treatment and, hopefully, into recovery.
I know what the waiting and the unknowns are like," she says.
Trout's daughter, Ella, was almost 8 months old when doctors first spotted a problem.
"It's a lot," Trout says.
"I didn't have somebody who was my go-to person," she says.
"When you get that initial diagnosis, you just have a lot of questions," she says.
"Patient navigation, in part, is a function of how fragmented our (health care) system is," Pratt says.
Freeman identified five main barriers his patients faced in receiving care: financial, communication, medical system, psychological and personal.
"People got lost in the complex system," Freeman says.
These barriers are never going to go away completely, Freeman says, but patient navigation can help address them.
For now, patient navigation is primarily being used in the cancer community, but it's spreading to other chronic diseases.
"I think when you go through things as a patient, you know, as a parent -- to be able to be treated with compassion and not just (as) another diagnosis is a gift," Trout says.
