In a second half of few openings, South Korean star Park dived to power home the winner on the hour mark from man of the match Darren Fletcher's superb cross.
It was another setback for Chelsea, who were knocked out of the Champions League by Inter Milan in midweek.
Fletcher claimed their earlier victory over Liverpool, who are battling with Tottenham, Manchester City and Aston Villa for the final Champions League spot, had put the pressure on Chelsea.
City move above Liverpool into fifth place, two points adrift of fourth-placed Tottenham, but with a game in hand.
