Brown, 20, faced charges of assaulting his pop star girlfriend, Rihanna, following a row earlier this year.
"This is not an easy sentence," Gibbons said.
Through her attorney, Rihanna had requested that such an order not be issued.
Rihanna's attorney, Donald Etra, said Rihanna made the request because she felt that a protective order in place, requiring that Brown not annoy or harass her, was sufficient.
"His sentence is not based on what he's available to do," Gibbons said.
Brown "embraces this as an opportunity to get his life back on track and get his career back on track," Geragos said, adding that Brown will speak further after his sentencing.
"A verbal argument ensued," followed by the physical attack, the statement said.
He threatened to "beat the s--t out of you" and kill her, according to the statement, and also bit her ear and her fingers.
"I am seeking the counseling of my pastor, my mother and other loved ones and I am committed, with God's help, to emerging a better person."
