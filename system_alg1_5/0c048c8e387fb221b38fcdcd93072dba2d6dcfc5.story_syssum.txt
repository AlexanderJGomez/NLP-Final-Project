Just hours after delivery, a baby born with HIV in Mississippi was given high doses of three antiretroviral drugs.
The girl was delivered at Miller Children's Hospital in Long Beach, California, last summer to a mother with HIV who had not received antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy.
"At this time, there is no plan to stop treatment."
"We didn't have the opportunity to treat the mom during the pregnancy as we would like to be able to do, to prevent transmission to the baby," said Dr. Hannah Gay, a pediatric HIV specialist at the University of Mississippi Medical Center.
In March 2013, researchers announced that the girl was the first child to be "functionally cured" of HIV.
All HIV-positive moms will pass on those antibodies, but only 30% will transmit the actual virus, said Dr. Katherine Luzuriaga, an immunologist at the University of Massachusetts who worked closely with Gay.
Usually, these infants would get antiviral drugs at preventive doses for six weeks to prevent infection, then start antiretroviral therapy, or ART, if HIV is diagnosed.
"I've been tested everywhere possible," said Brown, who now lives in San Francisco.
Even then, some HIV experts said that doesn't matter, that he's been cured.
In fact, many AIDS experts said they believe Brown has experienced what's called a "sterilizing" cure, meaning the virus has been eliminated from the body entirely.
