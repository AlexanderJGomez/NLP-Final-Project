"Everybody was trying to get off the plane," passenger Gabriel Trejos told CNN affiliate KUSA.
"On my side of the plane I could see the engine, I noticed it was on fire.
"They described a surreal scene when they pulled up, heavy fire on the right side of the aircraft, all chutes deployed from both sides of the aircraft, people evacuating and walking up the hillside towards them," Hynes said.
"There was significant extension of fire into the cabin portion," he said.
Planes resumed takeoffs and landings at the airport after the incident, although Day said a section of the airport will remain closed into Sunday.
A team from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was on its way to the scene to start an investigation.
