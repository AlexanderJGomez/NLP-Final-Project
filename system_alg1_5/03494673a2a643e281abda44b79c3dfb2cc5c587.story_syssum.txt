"Syria as a civilization is unraveling, with as many as half of its citizens in need of urgent help as a result of this savage conflict," said Antonio Guterres, the world body's high commissioner for refugees, who announced the goal in Geneva.
That's nearly half of the nation, which has a population of 22.5 million.
In addition, two French journalists working for Europe1 are missing in Syria, the French radio station said Friday, prompting fears that they may have been kidnapped.
The announcement came amid fighting over the Quneitra crossing, Syria's only access point to the Golan Heights.
Syria retook it in 1973.
