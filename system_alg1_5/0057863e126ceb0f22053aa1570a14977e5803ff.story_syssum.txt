One hundred Labor caucus members had been due to vote, but in the end, no votes were cast because there were no candidates beyond Gillard for prime minister, and Wayne Swan as her deputy.
Rudd lost that poll 31 to Gillard's 71, but the decisive vote failed to end speculation about a leadership challenge amid a poor performance by the prime minister in public polls.
Before the vote, Crean said he wouldn't be nominating himself as leader, but would take the job of deputy.
Soon after, she assigned him to the post of foreign minister.
In January, Gillard surprised the country by calling an election for September 14, the longest lead time for an Australian election in history.
