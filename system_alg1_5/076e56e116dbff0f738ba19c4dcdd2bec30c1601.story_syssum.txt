"Maybe sometimes people might think it's a good idea (for a celebrity's image) ... but most of the time it's a genuine interest," Krim said.
Because he's a dancer, I thought he'd connect with the Andrea Rizzo Foundation (which helps children with cancer through dance therapy).
Maybe sometimes people might thing it's a good idea (for their image) ... but most of the time it's a genuine interest... in fact, there's a lot of celebrities who do charity work who don't even want cameras around.
And that's what I love, that shows a true commitment, and genuine interest, not wanting to promote it.
I think it's great, (top celebrities like) Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Angelina Jolie, do amazing work ... but I think it's important to highlight other great things by young Hollywood, Sophia Bush from "One Tree Hill" ... Serinda Swan from "Breakout Kings," Ian Somerhalder from the "Vampire Diaries" cast ... people might not realize it's not just the A-listers who are philanthropic, it's everyone from young Hollywood.
Krim: I would say the best example of that might be Soulja Boy, who has gotten a lot of flak (he was recently arrested for gun and drug charges) ... he just came to my Children's Miracle Network event... he loves kids and he's all about giving back.
It should just be automatic... and it's something that the whole team from the publicists to the agents ... that should all be their focus.
