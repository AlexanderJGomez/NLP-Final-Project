"I believe the Lord chose me to lead that group," said Terry, who lives in Hurst, Texas.
"A lot of people say there's a lot of circumstances in your situation that really are unique," said Terry, "and I say no, they're not unique circumstances -- they're divine intervention.
But the circumstances of Terry's experience are unique, because there was a defibrillator nearby, and somebody knew how to use it.
The first link, according to the American Heart Association, is to recognize there's a problem, and call 911.
Once the machine determines that a shock should in fact be delivered, it tells the user to clear their hands from the patient's body, and press the "shock" button.
It's for these reasons, and the relatively low cost of a defibrillator that Gary Terry continues his crusade.
