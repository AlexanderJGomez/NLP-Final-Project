(CNN) -- Florida A&M University band director Julian White, who had been under pressure to step aside after the hazing-related death of a band member, is retiring, his attorney announced Thursday.
"Dr. White remains disappointed that barely 48 hours after meeting with band members, that Robert Champion was killed in an extreme, horrific and illegal act of bullying," Hobbs said in an earlier statement.
Champion's mother, Pam, has called for the FAMU band to be disbanded.
My son was murdered."
