In a March 16 statement on the agreement, the Eurogroup -- an informal body of eurozone finance ministers -- said the "current fragile situation of the Cypriot financial sector" was linked to its large size relative to the country's GDP.
So the big financial institutions like the Bank of Cyprus asked for a bailout from the government, and the government came to the EU in June 2012 saying it needed a bailout in turn.
Cyprus is trying to get a â‚¬10 billion eurozone bailout.
Cyprus' ministry of finance said in a statement that "without the levy, the sovereign debt would have undoubtedly been non-sustainable."
"Cyprus has a banking sector that is way too big and they are insolvent with that model and no one outside of Cyprus is at fault for that," Wolfgang Schaeuble said on German public broadcaster, ZDF.
"The question is whether this becomes a full-blown crisis or a mini-crisis," Steven Englander, global head of foreign exchange strategy at Citi told CNNMoney.
At least 35 banks from around the world have branches in Cyprus, according to the country's central bank.
In an address to the nation on March 17, President Nicos Anastasiades said the bailout option was "very difficult" but one that would eventually lead to economic recovery in Cyprus.
Nearly a third of the money in Cyprus' banks is Russian, CNNMoney reported.
Cyprus' finance minister was due to meet his Russian counterpart later Wednesday.
