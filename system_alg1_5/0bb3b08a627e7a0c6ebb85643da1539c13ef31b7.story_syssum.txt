Rouhani is not a reformist, even according to Iranian standards.
During the campaign, he presented himself as a moderate, a platform that appeals to Iran's young electorate, and called for drawing Iran out of its international isolation.
Ironically, Rouhani, the only cleric among the eight candidates, favors more political and social freedoms at home.
Last month, demonstrators chanted "Death to Dictator," meaning Khamenei, at the funeral of a dissident cleric in the city of Isfahan.
The watchdog Guardian Council had already helped Khamenei sideline his rivals, barring a prominent politician and a former president, Rafsanjani, from running in the race.
Further, Iran suspended its sensitive uranium enrichment activities, a process that can be used to make nuclear fuel or a nuclear bomb if uranium is enriched to high levels.
If Khamenei is willing to end international pressure over Iran's nuclear program, Rouhani provides the perfect opportunity.
