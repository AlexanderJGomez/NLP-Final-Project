"Garcia's callous disregard for human life resulted in the senseless murder of a young mother and her helpless 2-year-old son," said George Venizelos, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York Field Office, on the agency's website.
The FBI said that under the guise of an invitation to dinner in Central Islip, New York, Garcia coerced Argueta and her 2-year-old son into the woods.
"His appointment to the FBI's Top Ten list illustrates not only the seriousness of his crimes but our commitment to seeking justice for his victims," said Venizelos.
The FBI requests that anyone with information on Garcia contact its New York Field Office at 212-384-1000, a nearby law enforcement agency or U.S. Embassy or Consulate.
