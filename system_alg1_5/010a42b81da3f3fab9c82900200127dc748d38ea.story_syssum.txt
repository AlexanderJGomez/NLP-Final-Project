You won't get a burger there, though -- its cash registers and soft-serve machines have given way to old tape drives and modern computers run by a rogue team of hacker engineers who've rechristened the place McMoon's.
"It's like having a DVD in 1966, you can't play it.
Each satellite would point its dual lens Kodak camera at a target, snap a picture, then develop the photograph.
After finishing their missions, the satellites were unceremoniously dashed against the moon rocks, clearing the way for Apollo.
These didn't.
After the low-fi printing, the tapes were shoved into boxes and forgotten.
"We're both Apollo babies, so the moon to us was something that's unfinished business," says Cowing.
The data they recovered then had to be demodulated and digitized, which added more layers of technical difficulties.
"We're the first people out of a generation or more to see this," says Cowing.
So sometimes you look into a shadow in a picture that LRO's taken, and you don't see any detail -- with ours, you do."
"I had a choice between the barbershop and this building -- we didn't really care what sort of building they gave us, we just didn't want to pay for it," Cowing says.
All the images and the information gathered from them are being fed into the Planetary Data System, an official repository where mission data from LRO, Mars Observer, Climate Orbiter, and many others are documented.
"Back then things were designed, even if they failed, to still do something.
Back then they just had to engineer stuff elegantly so that it worked," he says.
