Hammar, 27, is being held in the border town of Matamoros, just across from Brownsville, Texas.
He intended to hunt with it, his parents said.
"The crime that he's charged with is possession of a weapon that's restricted for military use," said his mother, Olivia Hammar.
"He said: I have your son," Olivia Hammar recalled, tearing up.
U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat from Florida, stepped in on Hammar's behalf, speaking to Mexico's ambassador to the United States.
The calls have since stopped, his mother said.
"This is outrageous," Ros-Lehtinen said.
Hammar's parents now fear they could lose him just across the border, if they wait too much longer.
