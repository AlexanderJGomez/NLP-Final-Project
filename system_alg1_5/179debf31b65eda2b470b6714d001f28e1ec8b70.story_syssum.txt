Suleman -- known in tabloids as "Octomom" -- was not arrested, but was ordered to appear before an Los Angeles County judge for her initial arraignment, the DA said Monday.
"This is not a new career for her," her rep, Gina Rodriguez, told CNN in June when asked about her stripping gig.
"I've got to win the battle," she said.
Suleman faces up to five years, eight months in prison if convicted, the prosecutor said.
