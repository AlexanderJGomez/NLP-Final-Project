Istanbul, Turkey (CNN)The questions Turks asked on Tuesday were tinged with fear.
More than 24 hours later, Turkish officials were still at pains to explain the power outage.
There is fertile ground for rumor-mongering in Turkey.
The government's increasingly heavy-handed repression of public dissent, combined with overt censorship of the media and the internet, have also contributed to a hyper-polarized and deeply mistrustful political atmosphere.
Two gunmen had somehow infiltrated the Palace of Justice, the monolithic court house in the center of Istanbul.
On Tuesday, in the midst of the hostage crisis at the court house, the Turkish government imposed a gag order banning broadcasters from reporting on the Palace of Justice siege.
Just hours after the shooting, tensions exploded yet again at the court house.
As journalists jostled their way through security at the entrance to the largely deserted courthouse, some bystanders began chanting "government thieves."
In the meantime, Turkey feels increasingly vulnerable to demons of its own making.
