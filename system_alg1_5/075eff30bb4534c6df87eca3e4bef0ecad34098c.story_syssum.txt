A design student at the University of Edinburgh, he was aiming to produce an artistic exhibition for a module on sustainability, when he stumbled on "Dupe," a living alternative to concrete.
Crucially, Trimble believes his mechanism has the added benefit that it could be employed by anyone, anywhere.
You could use sand and bacteria on site, practically free, and have shelter housing that is far more permanent."
The company has won major prizes and funding for the bricks, which will be used in a structure for the first time this year in a pedestrian walkway, ahead of building projects across the world.
The product is in commercial use for packaging, producing thousands of units a month, and the company is expanding into construction.
"It has great insulation properties", says Sam Harrington, Ecovative Director of Sustainability.
"We are exploring ideas of living materials, perhaps that are self-healing or respond to leaks with indicators."
The material's versatility offers unique design opportunities, says David Benjamin, lead architect of the project.
Future applications would include pop-up stores, festival "tents" and emergency shelters, says Benjamin, but there are greater hopes for the material within the industry.
The material is stronger than concrete, with better insulation capacities".
"In biology, complex structures achieve resource efficiency by putting things in exactly the right place, which is very difficult with made materials", says Pawlyn.
"Our ways should deliver significant resource savings."
But from rock to fungus, sand to space dust, the use of materials and processes designed by nature herself offer both a solution to the sustainability crisis, and a glimpse of our new built environment: clean, efficient, and alive.
