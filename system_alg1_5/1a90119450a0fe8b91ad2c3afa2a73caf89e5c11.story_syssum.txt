However, with Madiba (as Mandela is often called), I feel like every moment spent with him is a gift, a blessing that I will tell my grandchildren about one day.
However, my stories about my encounters with Nelson Mandela are the stuff of comedy clubs.
He said to me, "You are so gracious, I am so humbled to meet you."
I remember thinking, if Nelson Mandela thinks I am gracious -- fantastic.
I sang along too, twinkle-finger actions included, it's a great song.
Of course, he didn't wave back, but I felt gracious and humbled in his presence, protected by Magdalene's great walls.
Once in while, I would regale my friends with Madiba's stories -- yes, there are more -- like the time I sneaked into the bathroom in his presidential mansion, desperate for relief, before a long-delayed press conference and phoned a friend from within to ask whether it was morally right to steal some of Nelson Mandela's soap.
Again, I became self-conscious.
So they whizzed away, slightly peeved, and I landed up with a "Me and Mandela" photograph that showed the president grinning into camera, holding me around the waist and me half bent over, lowering my handbag, with my head half cocked and eyes half closed.
I never thought I'd meet him again, up close and personal, until, last year when Zelda, ever the diplomat, like her boss, invited to me to introduce my newly born daughter, Freya, to him.
She freaked out some more.
