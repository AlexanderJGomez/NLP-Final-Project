This progress feels slow, she said, in comparison with her previous weight loss attempts, which consisted of crash dieting.
Reaching this 10-pound milestone, from 190 to 180 pounds, makes her feel as if it will be easier to lose more weight, she said.
She doesn't feel physically different, but she does notice a change from previous pictures of herself, she said.
Often, the initial weight loss will seem the easiest, and then the loss slows somewhat over time, said Tara Gidus, dietician for the Orlando Magic NBA team and owner of Tara Gidus Nutrition Consulting in Orlando, Florida.
At that rate, someone like Kim could lose 50 pounds in six months, she said.
"That's basically 2 pounds a week, plus 3 more," she said.
"It's ambitious, but I really want that camera."
