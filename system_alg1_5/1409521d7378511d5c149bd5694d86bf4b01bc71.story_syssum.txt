The man, Chris O'Leary of New York City, did what most of us would probably do.
"They rebooked everyone but me on another flight to LGA, so I am literally the only person on this plane," he posted.
O'Leary's Flight 6259, which normally seats 76 people, was delayed for six hours, and somehow he missed out on being rebooked.
As it turned out, O'Leary was not the only passenger on the flight.
"It was definitely the most memorable flight I've been on in recent memory if only for the sheer lack of passengers to become bothersome," he told ABC News.
