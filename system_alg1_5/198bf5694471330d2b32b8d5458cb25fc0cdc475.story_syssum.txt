Toyota has announced no recall of these vehicles, however, and said it has not received any complaints about the brakes from consumers.
The Fusion/Milan's issue seemed less serious than that of the Prius, said David Champion, the head of auto testing at Consumer Reports.
There are only 37,000 of those vehicles on the road, according to the agency.
Toyota will cooperate fully with NHTSA's investigation," the company said in a statement.
The Prius problem is a "disconnect" in the vehicle's complex anti-lock brake system that causes less than a one-second lag before the brakes start to work, Toyota said Thursday.
The company also said it changed the braking system software in January for vehicles built since then.
