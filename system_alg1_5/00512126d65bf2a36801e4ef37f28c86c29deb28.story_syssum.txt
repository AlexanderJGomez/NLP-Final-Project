LONDON, England (CNN) -- When Danish auteur Lars von Trier presented his gothic thriller, "Antichrist" at Cannes Film Festival last month, it was greeted with cat-calls, jeers and, at times, disbelieving laughter.
"Lars von Trier, we get it," wrote film critic Wendy Ide in UK paper The Times.
Despite, or perhaps because of, what he describes as his "sensitive" nature, von Trier is one of today's great contemporary European auteurs, considered responsible for spearheading a revival in the fortunes of Scandinavian filmmaking.
"I think that if you are, shall we say, sensitive, then there is a good side and a bad side about it," said von Trier.
Von Trier claimed each morning she would say "Mr von Trier, I despise you," and spit at him.
"I was scared," admitted Gainsbourg who won Best Actress at Cannes for her performance.
But, von Trier says, he has always taken a deeply personal approach to the experimental, often dark and challenging works that he creates.
