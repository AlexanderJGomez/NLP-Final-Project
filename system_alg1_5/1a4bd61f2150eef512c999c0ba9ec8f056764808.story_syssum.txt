Financially, the shipping industry is in the doldrums, suffering from over capacity and high oil prices.
"The bigger the ship the lower the fuel consumption, that's one thing," said Thomas Riber Knudsen, Asia Pacific CEO of shipping line Maersk.
Shipping's international regulator, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), has embarked on a greenhouse gas reduction program, part of which will come into action in 2013, which for the first time includes CO2 emissions.
"Its' very difficult to stand out as a single shipping line to do this...What we would like is to have comprehensive rules spanning the globe, so we don't have areas that are different from each other," said Knudsen.
The Singaporean company Ecospec, supported by the country's government, believes it has avoided this problem with its emission abatement system developed over the last ten years.
Until firmer international regulations emerge, linking cost-savings with environmental action is the best way to encourage the industry to do more, believes Manish Singh, of shipping consultancy, Ideocean.
There is a genuine commitment to the ecological cost but I suppose the fact that we have a very strong economic reason to take action adds to the urgency."
