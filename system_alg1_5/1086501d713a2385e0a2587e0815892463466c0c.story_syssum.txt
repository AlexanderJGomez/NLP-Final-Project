Gary Leon Ridgway, dubbed the Green River serial killer, pleaded guilty in 2003 to killing 48 women, including Major, though her remains hadn't been identified at the time, West said.
"Since (Major) was last known to be in Seattle and ... she was working as a prostitute, (her family) contacted detectives," West said.
"We are grateful to finally know what happened to Sandra after all these years," the family statement said.
On December 30, 1985, at the Mountain View Cemetery in Auburn, Washington, authorities found remains that were determined this week as belonging to Major, West said.
One of those sets of remains belonged to Kimi Pitsor, and the other remains are still unidentified, West said.
