After that, a new and different NATO mission will advise, train and assist the expected 350,000-strong Afghanistan force, Rasmussen said.
This is a process, and it's sometimes a messy process, just as it was in Iraq," he said.
Obama wanted NATO to commit to long-range support for Afghanistan, and Rasmussen said the alliance would support Afghan forces after the combat mission ends.
However, Obama and Zardari had a brief conversation Monday morning on the sidelines of the NATO session.
"We've already worked out a plan to have in six months time 75% of the country taken over, with regard to security by the Afghan security forces ," he said.
Obama and Karzai, who met a day ahead of Monday's NATO talks on Afghanistan, both agreed that the end of the war was close.
"Afghanistan, indeed, Mr. President, as you very rightly put it, is looking forward to an end to this war, and a transformational decade," he said.
