The plane bucks up and down, lurches forward and back, or both.

Turbulence struck the flight, from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Houston, Texas, unexpectedly, injuring seven passengers badly enough to require hospitalization after the pilot diverted the flight to Miami, Florida.
"Normally, it's an inconvenience," said Kevin Garrison, a retired Delta Air Lines pilot living in Lexington, Kentucky.
And wearing seat belts, aviation officials say, is the best way to stay safe.
"The majority of injuries actually happen to flight attendants," Dorr said.
"I saw people being thrown to the roof as if they were dolls," Fabio Ottolini, who was returning to Houston with his wife and daughter after visiting family in Brazil, told CNN affiliate KTRK-TV.
No passengers were reported seriously injured in turbulence incidents in 2008, and five flight attendants -- down from a high of 19 in 2003 -- received serious injuries, according to the FAA.
All licensed pilots also receive "upset training," which teaches how to deal with extreme turbulence, he said.
