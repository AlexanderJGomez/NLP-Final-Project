Maggie Atkinson, Children's Commissioner for England, described the report, titled "I thought I was the only one.
The report is based on the findings from the first year of a two-year study, based on evidence from the government, police, local authorities, health services, voluntary workers and young people.
In a high-profile court case earlier this year, nine men were jailed for "grooming," sexually abusing and raping five girls, one of them only 13, in Rochdale, Greater Manchester.
Atkinson, the Children's Commissioner for England, urged people to look out for the signs of sexual exploitation in young people around them.
Also in the past month, a BBC program looking into historic sex abuse allegations at children's homes in Wales in the 1970s and 1980s alleged that a Conservative, Thatcher-era politician, whom it did not name, had been among the children's abusers.
He is now planning multiple libel suits, and the BBC has already settled.
