Police also had contact with him the day his children disappeared, when he allegedly admitted to a Lexington County sheriff's deputy that he "forced" his five kids, all between the ages of 1 and 8, out of a vehicle at a Walmart on August 28, according to an affidavit.
Jones, 32, was arrested Saturday in Smith County, Mississippi, and charged with driving under the influence, possession of synthetic marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia, the Lexington County Sheriff's Department in South Carolina said.
The mother, who was pregnant, said that the children were 3, 4 and 5 and too young to start school, but that when they were of age, they would be home-schooled, the report says.
The caseworker called police, but when Jones arrived, he'd calmed down, the report states.
Four months ago, a South Carolina DSS case manager spoke to one of the children, who said Jones made them do exercises for punishment.
"She stated that is not afraid of her dad," the report states.
Of that encounter, Jackie Swindler, a representative of the South Carolina Department of Social Services, said, "DSS did not see any visible signs of abuse.
The sheriff's department was seeking Jones and the children, whom Jones' ex-wife had reported missing.
"I don't understand why he did it but, yes, these children were in the car, deceased, in garbage bags for some period of time," McCarty said.
"I'm a father and I'm a grandfather, and in all of my years of law enforcement, I have never seen a case like this," McCarty said.
