Standard separation distance is three miles, Cory said, noting that an investigation is under way.
"Air traffic control was aware that they had a situation where separation was less than they would like," Cory said.
"During the switchover of operations, miscommunication between the Tracon and the DCA tower led to a loss of the required separation between two regional jets departing from Runway 1 and a regional jet inbound for Runway 19," the Federal Aviation Administration said.
"Such near misses and any operational errors are calls to action," Rep. John L. Mica, R-Florida, said after the Tuesday incident.
