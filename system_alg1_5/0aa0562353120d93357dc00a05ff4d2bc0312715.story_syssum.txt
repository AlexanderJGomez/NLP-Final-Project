(CNN) -- The Dalai Lama Friday rejected a series of allegations from the Chinese government, saying he does not seek the separation of Tibet and has no desire to "sabotage" the Olympic games.
That's clear-cut.
I feel for the victims and their families and pray for them," the Dalai Lama said in his written statement Friday.
"Chinese brothers and sisters, I assure you I have no desire to seek Tibet's separation.
In a statement, CNN said, "We have provided comprehensive coverage of all sides of this story," adding that the network's "reputation is based on reporting global news accurately and impartially."
Earlier this week, China offered some media organizations -- not including CNN -- a carefully managed tour of Tibet's capital, but ran into a public-relations roadblock when a group of Buddhist monks began screaming protests at a holy shrine.
