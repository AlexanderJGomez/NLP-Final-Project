"The suspect has been found inside the school and he has deceased as a result of what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound," Robinson said in one of his first statements after the shooting.
One person -- a minor -- was taken to Littleton Adventist Hospital with a gunshot wound, Lauren Brendel, a hospital spokeswoman, told CNN.
He then asked other students the whereabouts of a faculty member, he said.
I said, 'They are shooting in the school.'"
"In my opinion, that was the most important tactical decision that could have been made," Robinson said.
The other was "rendered safe," Robinson said.
He was a little geeky but in a charming way," he said.
"We were having fun and laughing and then, all of a sudden, we heard a really loud bang," the 15-year-old told CNN.
"We were shaking, we were crying, we were freaking out," Riley said.
Within about 14 minutes of the initial report, "we had information on the radio that my deputies believed they had the shooter down inside the school," Robinson said.
The high school, with a student population of 2,229 students, has 70 classrooms.
John Hickenlooper called the shooting an "all-too-familiar sequence, where you have gunshots and parents racing to the school and unspeakable horror in a place of learning."
