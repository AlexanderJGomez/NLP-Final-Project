First, the bad: Based on CEO Tim Cook's comments Tuesday on the company's quarterly earnings call, Apple appears unlikely to announce a major new product until this fall at the earliest.
Of course, Cook made similar comments early in 2012 when he said Apple was working to deliver "some products that will blow your mind."
"In the past, Apple didn't have to promise exciting new things," he wrote.
"It just delivered them."
