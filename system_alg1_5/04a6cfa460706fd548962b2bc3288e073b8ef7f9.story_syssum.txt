Swierczynski is the author of several acclaimed crime thrillers, a regular contributor to Marvel Comics and has collaborated with Anthony E. Zuiker, the Hollywood mastermind behind TV's "CSI" on the series of best-selling, Level 26 "digi-novels."
Swierczynski: "Fun & Games" is about an alcoholic house sitter who, one sunny California morning, finds himself squared off against the most lethal killers in the world.
(He dies in the opening pages of the sequel, "Hell & Gone.")
It's inspiring, in a demented sort of way.
Swierczynski: Whoever said that is very kind, and I owe them money.
If someone closes one of my novels before finishing, I consider it a failure.
Swierczynski: Absolutely.
Swierczynski: Well, for better or worse, Philly is where my imagination goes to play.
Swierczynski: Such a great question, because I leave for a cross-country book tour/road trip in a few weeks, and I've been obsessing about which books to pack.
Swierczynski: My first issue of "Birds of Prey," for DC Comics, will appear this September -- which is part of the companywide relaunch of every single title (all with new No.1 issues).
And then in late December: "Dark Revelations," my third Level 26 thriller with Anthony E. Zuiker.
