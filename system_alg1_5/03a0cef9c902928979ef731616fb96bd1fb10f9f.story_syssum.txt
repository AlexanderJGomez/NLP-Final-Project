The Clinton campaign said she will make the announcement at "an event in Washington, D.C.," where she will also  thank her supporters.
"I am very confident how unified the Democratic Party is going to be to win in November," he said in a Senate hallway Wednesday.
Rangel, the senior member of the New York congressional delegation and an early supporter of Clinton's presidential campaign, said Wednesday that Clinton should have been more clear about what her plans are.
"I would agree that after the math was in before her speech, that she could have been far more generous in terms of being more specific and saying that she wants a Democratic victory," Rangel said on MSNBC.
She again invoked the popular vote, saying she snared "more votes than any primary candidate in history," but primaries come down to delegates, and according to CNN calculations, Obama has her beaten, 2,156 to 1,923.
That, she said, would be up to her supporters and the party brass.
Saying Clinton would "entertain the idea if it's offered," Johnson said, "This is Sen. Obama's decision.
Obama."
It continues, "But most important, we need to have the certainty of winning; and, I believe, without question, that Barack Obama as president and Hillary Clinton as vice president bring that certainty to the ticket."
Clinton said that would happen soon, Gibbs said, but he also said Obama did not raise the issue of the vice presidency.
