"There are neither facts nor information that secret CIA detention centers existed in Lithuania," the ministry said in a statement, contradicting Amnesty International statements a day earlier based on a report by Lithuanian lawmakers.
The Bush administration came under fierce criticism for the alleged practice of "extraordinary rendition" -- capturing suspected terrorists in one country, moving them to another country without proper legal protections, and using "enhanced interrogation techniques" on them.
"The agency's terrorist detention program is over, and the CIA has not commented publicly on where facilities associated with that effort may or may not have been," said Paul Gimigliano of the CIA Office of Public Affairs.
"Confirmation of the existence of a secret prison in Lithuania marks a modern low point for human rights protection in Europe," said Julia Hall, Amnesty International's expert on counterterrorism in Europe.
"To think that any national government would have foreign aircraft flying into its airspace, people being taken from aircraft and moved to control facilities somewhere within their sovereign territories -- and neither the central government, police, customs or air traffic control, no one knew anything about this except for the head of the security service ... that's just not believable," said Ayers, the former CIA officer.
"The inquiry's findings are only a first step toward accountability," said Hall.
