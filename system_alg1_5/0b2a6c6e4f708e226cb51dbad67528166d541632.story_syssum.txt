Melissa Huckaby is charged with killing 8-year-old Sandra Cantu, who was a friend of her own daughter.
Melissa Huckaby, 28, was arrested and charged with killing and raping 8-year-old Sandra Cantu, a friend of her 5-year-old daughter.
Huckaby did not enter a plea or speak during the court hearing, although she flinched when Sandra Cantu's name was spoken, and she cried at times.
Huckaby is the granddaughter of Clifford Lane Lawless, pastor of Clover Road Baptist Church near the mobile home park, and she taught Sunday school at the church, police have said.
A memorial ceremony is scheduled for Sandra at 1 p.m. Thursday at a high school in Tracy, police said.
