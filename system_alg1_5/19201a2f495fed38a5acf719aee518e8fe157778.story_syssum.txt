(CNN) -- It was wet, cold and windy, and he hadn't been in contention to win golf's oldest tournament for 10 years, but Darren Clarke finally made the breakthrough at the British Open on Sunday.
To everybody, thank you very much."
Clarke has twice won World Golf Championship events, in 2003 and 2003, while he has finished second on the European Tour's money list three times.
Clarke, who last finished in the top-10 when he placed third at Royal Lytham & St. Anne's in 2001, could afford to bogey the final two holes as he carded a level-par 70.
Johnson, seeking his first major title, drove out of bounds at the 14th and his double-bogey there handed Clarke a four-shot buffer.
France's Raphael Jacquelin was eighth on 281, while Spain's Sergio Garcia, Englishman Simon Dyson and U.S. Ryder Cup captain Davis Love tied for ninth on 282.
