But Karen Kraushaar, one of the women who have made allegations, told CNN Tuesday night that Cain is a "serial denier."
Ain't going to happen," Cain said.
The restaurant association said at the time that it investigated the accusations and Cain denied them, Bennett noted.
And, Kraushaar told CNN, she received a $46,000 sexual harassment settlement, rather than a severance agreement.
"There is safety in numbers," she said.
The woman, who spoke on condition of not being identified, said she spoke extensively with her friend about Cain's conduct in 1998 at the time the accuser was allegedly being harassed by Cain while both worked at the restaurant association.
"He said, 'Mom, I think you need to do the right thing.
"I respected him.
And it just was shocking to me that he would use that power in such a way," Bialek said.
Gordon said there was "no record, nor even a complaint filed" to support Bialek's accusation.
"It takes incredible courage for an individual to come forward," as Bialek has done, Murkowski said.
I am concerned."
"She knows that's not something I would do," he said.
The ongoing allegations, he adds, are a "test of Cain's leadership" and "a tipping point for his campaign."
"You cannot let this dominate the campaign," Vander Plaats said, a sentiment echoed by other analysts.
