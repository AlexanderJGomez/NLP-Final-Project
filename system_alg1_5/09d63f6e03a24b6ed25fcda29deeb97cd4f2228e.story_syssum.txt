Sony, makers of the top-selling PlayStation 4, has rolled out "Project Morpheus," a virtual reality system it says will pair with its top-selling gaming console to immerse players in the virtual worlds in which they're playing.
"VR is exciting because it thoroughly immerses players in ways not possible on a regular TV set," said Dan "Shoe" Hsu, a longtime gaming journalist and editor-in-chief of GamesBeat.
"Wherever you turn your head, that's where you'll look, even if it's physically behind you.
"Not every PS4 owner will buy it, of course," he said.
For one, the Oculus Rift is designed to work, primarily, with PCs.
Oculus has drummed up more than $90 million in funding and, in August, brought in legendary gaming developer John Carmack, the lead programmer behind classic games like "Doom," "Quake" and "Wolfenstein 3D," as chief technology officer.
"If Sony's announcement forces Oculus to be even more aggressive in creating a top-notch VR unit and getting it to market more quickly, then the consumers will benefit."
