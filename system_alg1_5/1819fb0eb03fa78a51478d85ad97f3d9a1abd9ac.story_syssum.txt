OK, maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration.
Secondly, and far more importantly, the Postal Service is in a financial "hot mess."
Look, I understand that one of the mandates of the Postal Service is, "portraying the American experience to a world audience through the issuance of postage stamps."
In 2001, the Postal Service came under fire from some on the right when it released the Frida Kahlo stamp because she was a Communist, a Mexican and a bisexual.
Rather, it's because stamp purists are dismayed by the increasing commercialization of U.S. postage stamps.
Stamps bearing images of iconic America, like national parks and national heroes, will always have their audience.
So I say it's time for the Postal Service to roll out stamps that will make money.
