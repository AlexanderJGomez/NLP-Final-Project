Born in Germany, Tugend lived a comfortable, upper-middle class life in Berlin.
That the Tugend family was successful, educated and loyal Germans no longer meant anything.
"It was little things at first, and people would say, 'Well, we can live with that,' and then another more stringent law would pass and people would say, 'This isn't ideal, but things will get better,'" Tugend said.
In May 1939, Tugend, his sister and their mother entered the United States as refugees.
Despite their escape, Tugend said his father was never the same.
The whole experience "broke him, spiritually and physically," he said.
"Even then I knew the historical significance of the war and I wanted to be a part of it," he said.
"As long as I was just an infantryman, they were shooting at us, we were shooting at them, that's all you think about," he said.
"Every town and village I went to," Tugend said, "I would be told, 'No, I'm not a Nazi.
"You have to understand, the average German may have known what the Nazis were up to, but I think most of them were just trying to survive," he said.
Tugend left the Army soon after the war's end, but he wasn't finished fighting.
After all these years, Tugend is philosophical about his family's escape from certain death at the hands of the Nazis, and his time as an infantryman at war.
