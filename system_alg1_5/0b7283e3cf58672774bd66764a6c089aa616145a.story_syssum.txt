But what's clear is that the application, which will work hand in hand with the upcoming Windows 8 operating system, is Microsoft's play to make the Xbox 360 an indispensable tool for all kinds of entertainment.
SmartGlass is not a kind of glass.
No, you don't.
But, at least as Microsoft describes it, SmartGlass will pull lots of those features together into one app as well as take them further.
Then, there's the gaming aspect.
So, as long as you have the right hardware, there presumably will be no extra cost.
Microsoft says SmartGlass will be available this fall, which is about the same time a final version of Windows 8 has been promised.
