That blueprint will focus on manufacturing, energy, education and middle-class values, according to a video released on the Obama's campaign website and Democratic sources who have been briefed on the address.
However, this official acknowledged that Obama's tone will not differ significantly from the approach he's taken in recent months when he's attacked Republicans in Congress for general inaction.
The speech will build on a theme the president laid out in Kansas last month -- that in today's economy, the game has been rigged against the nation's middle class.
Democratic sources told CNN on Sunday that the bullet points of Obama's blueprint will focus on American manufacturing, including "insourcing" -- or bringing back jobs from overseas.
"They're big ideas, because we've got to meet the moment, and this speech is going to be about how we do it," the president's preview video released over the weekend said.
"We can go in two directions," Obama said.
