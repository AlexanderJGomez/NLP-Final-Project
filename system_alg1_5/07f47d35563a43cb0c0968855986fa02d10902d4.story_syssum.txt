Since Sir Edmund Hillary and his Sherpa guide, Tenzing Norgay, first conquered Mount Everest in 1953, thousands of trekkers have tried to follow their footsteps.
"With this collaboration we aimed to raise awareness about pollution at Everest," explained Kripa Rana Shahi, director of Da Mind Tree, the organization that initiated the project.
We hope our creations will help inspire actions against pollution at the Everest," Nara Bahadur BK, another artist, said.
"Each expedition to Everest is required to take a garbage deposit and bring their waste back," Diwas Pokhrel, the group's general secretary, said.
These are airlifted to Nepal's capital, Kathmandu.
"We hope our creative works of art will inspire and encourage people to keep the mountains clean," Shahi said.
