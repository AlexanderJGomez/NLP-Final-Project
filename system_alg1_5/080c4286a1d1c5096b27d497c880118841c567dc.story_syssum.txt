Sidney Frank, shown accepting an honorary degree in 2005, gave $100 million to Brown University.
"The world of difference that he made for each and every one of us is unbelievable, incredible," one of the Frank Scholars, 22-year-old Shane Reil, said Sunday.
He and his mother were getting by, but the Massachusetts native thought community college or a big state school would be all he could afford.
"He said, 'No, no, that's $37,000 for this year, and it will be covered [the rest of the years] too.'
It was a great moment," Reil said.
Brown no longer does that, and Frank's gift was "integral" in bringing the change, said Jim Miller, Brown's dean of admissions.
Most recipients are the first in their families to go to college, Miller said.
Frank, though he went to Brown only one year, landed an engineering job at Pratt & Whitney in part because someone there had gone to the school, said his daughter, Cathy Halstead.
In 2004, he sold Grey Goose for $2.2 billion, said Halstead, 61, of Seattle, Washington.

"He really wanted kids who were coming from very economically challenged backgrounds to have the chance to make it all the way through," said Halstead, who attended Sunday's graduation ceremony.
