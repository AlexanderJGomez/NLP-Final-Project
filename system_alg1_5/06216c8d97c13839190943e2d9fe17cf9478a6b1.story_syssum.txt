Meanwhile, AT&T iPhone users consume roughly 25 percent less data, or about 338 megabytes per month.
If the trends continue, Verizon could see an explosion in data usage.
Smartphone data usage started exploding for Verizon when the company launched its first Android phones in the fourth quarter last year, Finegold said.
Even though fewer Verizon cell phone subscribers are using data services, individually, they are consuming roughly the same amount of data each month as the average AT&T customer.
According to data analyzed by Validas, about half of AT&T's iPhone customers use less than 200MB of data per month.
Verizon has twice as many of those customers than AT&T has, Finegold said.
In an effort to keep iPhone data usage in check so it doesn't completely overwhelm its network, AT&T recently eliminated its all you-can-eat data plan.
Verizon still offers its unlimited data plan.
For example, about half of Sprint's cell phone subscribers, including smartphone customers, use data on Sprint's network.
T-Mobile only has about 22.3 percent of its cell phone subscriber base subscribing to data, and those consumers are only using about 120MB of data per month.
But even with faster network speeds in some markets, Sprint and T-Mobile still lack the comprehensive coverage that AT&T and Verizon offer.
"People who travel tend to be more mobile, and they also tend to be power users when it comes to mobile data," Finegold said.
