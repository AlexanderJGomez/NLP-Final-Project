The NASL, which collapsed in 1984, favored big names and an adaptation of the rules, while the MLS has tried to supplement home-grown talent with foreign stars such as David Beckham, capable of taking the game's reach to more fans.
Film producer Joe Roth, comedian Drew Carey and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, among others, combined to convince the MLS to accept the city's bid and to create the Seattle Sounders Football Club.
"It's the most played sport [here]," adds Greg Mockos, co-president of the Emerald City Supporters (ECS) -- the Sounders' largest fan organization.
"You can go around downtown Seattle at every park and every pitch, and there are hundreds of teams playing."
In that sense it's very European, very international."
"A major problem with the atmosphere at typical American sports is the number of stoppages, there are too many times when tension is lost," explains Robby Branom, part of the ECS.
For some people the gap has been filled, but not for me."
"The Sounders have done everything right to placate and involve the soccer fans," Kelley said.
The Sounders will be absent from Sunday's MLS Cup final, held at Qwest Field, but Seattle's soccer fans will surely echo Schmid's sentiment.
