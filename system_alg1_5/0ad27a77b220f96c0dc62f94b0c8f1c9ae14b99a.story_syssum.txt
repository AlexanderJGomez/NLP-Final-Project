Other protesters shouted at the tops of their lungs, demanding answers.
All 11 disappeared between 10 a.m. and noon, they say.
Guadalupe Dominguez, a relative of one of the missing, said a witness told her the 11 people were kidnapped by armed men who showed up in SUVs, but authorities say there's no evidence of such an incident.
He told them to get out, and armed men in black SUVs were already waiting for them outside," Zamudio said.
We have to do something to find them," Mancera said.
So far, he said, an analysis of video from the cameras does not show any violence in or around the bar where the kidnapping supposedly took place.
Shabazz, 28, was found just outside the bar by police at 3:30 a.m. one block south of Plaza Garibaldi.
Rios Garza said the men work at the bar, The Palace Club, where Shabazz and three people had drinks.
