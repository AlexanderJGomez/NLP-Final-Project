Hong Kong (CNN) -- Borrowed place, borrowed time.
Far from being subsumed by China's political system, Hong Kong would in fact lead it towards democracy.
Yes, there will be one person, one vote, but Beijing has said they want to control who Hong Kong's voters are allowed to vote for.
Occupy Central with Love and Peace, a protest group committed to true universal suffrage, had threatened a campaign of bringing business in downtown Hong Kong to a standstill if China didn't allow for a more democratic process.
And in an extraordinary admission just after Beijing made its ruling on Sunday, a leader of the Occupy movement, Benny Tai, in an interview with Bloomberg, conceded support for their cause was sliding.
As David Zweig, a professor of political science at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said, "If this was a game of chicken, the mainland has said: 'we'll drive straight through this' and Occupy Central has pulled aside and replied, 'we aren't willing to destroy Hong Kong.'"
And neither Beijing nor Hong Kong's leadership can ill-afford to ignore them.
