CNN: Before Bo Xilai's trial, many commentators predicted it would follow a tight script but that doesn't appear to be the case.
All of a sudden, in my view, Bo has decided not to cooperate, but not completely.
Li: Bo as a person, as a leader, is unpredictable.
Li: Of course there would have been deals made before, otherwise the leadership would not be willing to pursue the charges.
And relatively speaking, at least in people's perception, he's not that corrupted.
That's the fundamental dilemma for the leadership.
Certainly it will not be too severe.
In my view he was clear, focused, articulate and eloquent.
Li: Absolutely.
Li: A line has been drawn.
Of course the prosecution didn't buy that, but when people judge, at least the civilian people, they buy that argument.
In 18 months a lot has changed; there's been a leadership succession, Wen Jiabao's retirement, and the princelings have consolidated their power.
Li: Of course he will be convicted, otherwise it would be disastrous.
The worst is probably the life sentence, and the most lenient probably 15 years.
