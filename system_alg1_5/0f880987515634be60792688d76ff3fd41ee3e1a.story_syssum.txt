Some coin-operated newspaper machines have lasted for 30 years, but lack of sales may force their retirement.
To begin to answer the question, all it takes is an early morning visit with a man who feeds those machines.
Mike's job, which takes less than a couple of minutes per stop, entails filling the coin-operated machine with the day's papers, collecting unsold copies and emptying the machine of its coins.
Though he's been on this job for only two years, Mike has been on the route long enough to know business is down.
In 1999, the Times had 13,300 vending machines, but today that number has shrunk to 5,678, according to Diane McNulty, spokeswoman for the Times.
Still, he concedes, "Business is down about 25 to 30 percent from about five years ago."
But the heart of any machine is the coin mechanism, which can have 150 moving parts, according to the manufacturer.
It's certainly slowed down," said Kaspar.
Though the coin-operated machine business makes up 25 percent of the parent company's overall business, Sho-Rack has learned to diversify and adapt.
"We're not dependent on any one industry," Kaspar said.
For the Kaspar Sho-Rack Company, as long as newspapers are printed and sold, its machines will gladly continue to accept coins.
