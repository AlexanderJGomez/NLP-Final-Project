Berlin (CNN) -- The outbreak of E. coli in Germany has killed several more people and sickened hundreds, authorities said Tuesday.
The Robert Koch Institute, Germany's federal unit responsible for disease control and prevention, said 373 people have been confirmed sickened.
His hospital has 600 to 700 infected patients, Debatin said.
But the source has not yet been pinpointed, authorities said.
The questions surrounding produce from Spain have "paralyzed" vegetable exports, a spokeswoman for Fepex, the Spanish export producers group for vegetables and fruits, said Tuesday.
The Fepex officials argue that German authorities have accused the Spanish cucumber of being the source of the outbreak, without proof.
In 2010, Spain exported 9.4 million tons of produce; a quarter of that went to Germany, Fepex said.
Spanish authorities are sharing their investigative results with German and European Union authorities, the spokesman added.
