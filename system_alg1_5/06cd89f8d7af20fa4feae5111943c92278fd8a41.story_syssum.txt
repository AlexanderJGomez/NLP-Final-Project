Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- The Mount Merapi volcano in Indonesia erupted at least three times Tuesday, forcing thousands of nearby residents to flee.
"There was panic," he said.
"Right now, our biggest concern is the children," said Fadli Usman, World Vision Indonesia's rapid assessment team leader.
The evacuees, he said, are worried about the men who stayed behind to guard their homes and fields on the mountain.
The traffic was not chaotic, he said, and the road was open and under control.
