(InStyle.com) -- Actress Cameron Diaz talks candidly about love, guys, friends, family and charting her own course.
"I don't like overdone or being too put-together," she explains.
They're really old, and I love them.
"I'm Cuban, so I'm drawn to things that sparkle.
"I'm a woman," she says, like, Duh!
"I trust my judgment," she says.
You can have intellectual but not social.
I don't.
She pauses, then offers an answer: "How about this -- I am happy right now.
They're just really good, cool people."
