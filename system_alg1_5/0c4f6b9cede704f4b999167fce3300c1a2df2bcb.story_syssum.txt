After months of questions and pressure from whistle-blowers, academic reform groups, the public and members of Congress, the NCAA has decided to reopen its investigation into The University of North Carolina over its so-called paper class scandal.
On Monday, she said the NCAA had lost credibility by not investigating the issue.
For years, and after several internal investigations, UNC said a single professor, Julius Nyang'oro, knew about the fake classes.
Among those cooperating, he said, is Nyang'oro.
"The money is paid back already," Woodall said.
A spokesman for his office said it is still going through the response.
