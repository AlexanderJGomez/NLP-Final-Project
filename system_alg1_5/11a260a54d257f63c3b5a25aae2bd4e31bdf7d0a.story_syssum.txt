"We work within our abilities," said Gen. Khaklil Al-Khaled, a provincial military commander in northeastern Syria.
Syrian commanders were interviewed by CNN along the border, where Syria and the United States have a complicated relationship.
Still, some insurgent activity continues in Anbar and along the Nineveh province section of the Iraqi-Syrian border.
Al-Khaled said Syrian troop outposts are strung along the vast, sandy 385-mile Syria-Iraq border, with 12 soldiers per post.
The Syrian military said it has no communication with U.S. commanders along the border -- something that troubles Syrian commanders.
Americans say the errors are tactical or human, he said, but he doubts those assertions because of the U.S. military's acumen and resources.
The U.S. military has not responded to a request for comment.
