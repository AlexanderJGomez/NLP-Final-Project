The same jury that convicted Carla Hughes of two counts of murder Tuesday for the death of Avis Banks spared her life, declining to impose the death penalty.
Prosecutors alleged that Hughes killed Banks so she could have Pittman, a colleague at Chastain Middle School in Jackson, to herself.
"I'm not asking you, I'm pleading with you, to spare my daughter's life," said Hughes, who is also a teacher.
Suspicion initially fell on Pittman, who admitted to having an affair with Hughes, a language arts teacher.
Instead, the jury heard from a forensic pathologist, who described the nature of Banks' injuries.
... She was met by a stone-cold killer," he said.
