Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- The death toll from heavy floods and mudslides in Mexico increased Tuesday to 41, a government agency announced.
Interior Secretary Fernando Francisco Gomez Mont has declared a state of natural disaster for the Michoacan cities of Angangueo, Ocampo, Tiquicheo de Nicolas Romero, Tuxpan and Tuzantla.
More than 3,500 Michoacan residents are homeless, the state government said on its Web site.
"It's a very complicated operation," he said.
Mexico state is bordered on the west by Michoacan and adjoins Mexico City on three sides -- north, east and west.
