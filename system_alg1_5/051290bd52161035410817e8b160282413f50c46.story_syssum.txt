"It's everywhere," Hockin-Minopetros said, explaining how she found two large bags of sea glass in a variety of hues: brown, white, blue, milky green and a "gorgeous" red piece she can't take her eyes off.
"This is an epic summer for a collection of beach glass," she said.
As Sandy swallowed beaches and deterred patrons, businesses in southern New Jersey's Cape May Point suffered, said resident Jeanette Bartolomeo.
That's why Hurricane Sandy and the February nor'easter were "a blessing," Bartolomeo said.
Bartolomeo said she's already seen an increase in tourists this summer at Sunset Beach, where visitors can be found scouring the beach for the quarter-size "diamonds" washing up on the shore.
"I'm afraid New Jersey's shoreline will be one big McMansion, and that saddens me deeply," she said.
"I only keep the real unusual," she said.
