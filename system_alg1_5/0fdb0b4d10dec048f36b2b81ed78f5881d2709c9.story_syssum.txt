Even after seven seasons, "True Blood" kept fans guessing right on through to the end.
Granted, the show has been building up to Bill's death the last few episodes, but it still seemed like something that wouldn't actually happen.
He knew they wouldn't be able to stay away from one another, and he wanted Sookie to have the life he felt she deserved -- one with a family, something a vampire cannot give her.
His martyrdom and his speech were romantic, but then he asked Sookie, while she stood there crying over his impending death, to do the actual killing.
Apparently, there just wasn't enough time, not with Sookie donning a black dress to meet Bill at the graveyard for his funeral.
As for Sookie, she got her happy ending.
"Wow True Blood series finale was horrible," another fan said.
"May be the only fan who loved the finale," chimed in one grateful viewer.
So thank you, "True Blood," for taking viewers on an unforgettable, bloody ride, and staying true until the very end.
