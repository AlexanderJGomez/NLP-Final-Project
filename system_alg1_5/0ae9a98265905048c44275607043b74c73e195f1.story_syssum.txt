"On one hand, we knew where things were going so we could build these huge story arcs in the first one, and even in the second one, that would get resolved in the third game," said Casey Hudson, executive producer of the "Mass Effect" series.
As with "Mass Effect 2," players who have saved characters will be able to import them into "Mass Effect 3," changing some dialogue (the game will have a hefty 40,000 lines) and missions to reflect actions taken in previous games.
"If you are coming in as a new player, those plot lines are established, but you also get to make the biggest decisions in them.
He added, "That was the real fun of developing 'Mass Effect 3.'
Players, new and veteran, will both have those choices to make and be saddled with the emotional baggage that goes along with it.
"Mass Effect 3" will be available Tuesday in North America, Thursday in Australia, March 9 in Europe and March 15 in Japan.
It is playable on the Xbox 360, PlayStation 360 and Windows PC.
