Cue the "spy who shagged me" jokes.
Matt Damon's made a pretty fantastic spy as Jason Bourne in "The Bourne Identity" and its sequels.
It's hard to pinpoint who the sexiest Bond was, but Pierce Brosnan did a good job of it in 1995's "Goldeneye."
His character is irreverent and passionate and no offense to Chris Pine, who'll be reprising the role in 2012's "Moscow" but Ford can't be easily replaced.
He was young, fit, and with the Scottish accent, it's no wonder that he slayed the ladies of Japan.
But way back in 1996, he was a pretty convincing spy in "Mission: Impossible."
The gravity-defying acrobatics, black leather, and futuristic gadgets made Cruise a fantastic action star and we'll have to see if he's still got it in him when he plays a secret agent in "Knight and Day," which opens this week.
