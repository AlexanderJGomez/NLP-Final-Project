"I wanted to prove that I was whole, and one of the ways to do that was to learn to surf," Cummings said.
And when I felt the first breath of freedom, of riding that wave, I was like, 'This is so good, so inspiring.'
"We want to inspire them to move on and just be active and live full lives," said Cummings, 40.
Participants are provided with food, surfboards, wetsuits, sunscreen and towels.
But the clinics aren't just about surfing, Cummings said.
A retired Navy rescue swimmer, Davis, 28, was paralyzed from the waist down as a result of a car accident.
"Surfing makes me feel like I'm flying," Davis said.
"I'm missing my leg and there are days I don't want to get out of bed," Cummings said.
For Cummings, AmpSurf will always be about more than just surfing; it's about happiness, not just for the participants, but for him and his volunteers.
