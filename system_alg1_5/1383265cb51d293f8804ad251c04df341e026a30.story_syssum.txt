The motive for the attack is not known.
The soldiers were armed but were not able to defend themselves as the attack happened quick and sudden," a security official in the province said.
Last week, an airstrike killed five suspected al Qaeda militants in the province, where the Defense Ministry says at least 100 suspected terrorists are hiding.
Hundreds of additional troops were deployed after the terror alert on August 3.
