However, as our world is made up of matter, antimatter seems to have disappeared.
The researchers created 38 antihydrogen atoms and held on to them for about a tenth of a second, which is long enough to study them says Professor Jeffrey Hangst, one of the team of CERN scientists who worked on the program.
I am just full of joy and relief, it's taken us five years to get here, this is a big milestone," Hangst told CNN.
For reasons that no one yet understands, nature ruled out antimatter... this inspires us to work that much harder to see if antimatter holds some secret."
