The remarks were "embarrassing and racially insensitive," said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, head of the GOP's Senate campaign arm, in a statement to CNN.
Tim Kaine of Virginia, chairman of the Democratic Party, said "the case is closed" following Reid's round of apologies.
Democrats rejected the calls for Reid's dismissal, and Reid's office made clear he has no plans to step down.
The authors write that "Reid was convinced, in fact, that Obama's race would help him more than hurt him in a bid for the Democratic nomination."
In a statement issued after the call, Obama said, "As far as I am concerned, the book is closed."
Steele, the GOP's first African-American chairman, was asked about the remarks on both "Meet the Press" and "Fox News Sunday."
"As we await his explanation, Sen. Reid should do the right thing, follow the example that he himself set in 2002, and step down as majority leader," Cornyn said.
Asked whether Reid should resign, he said, "Absolutely not.
"While I am disappointed in Sen. Reid's comment and choice of words, I accept his apology," said Horsford, a Democrat.
I wasn't intending to say a racial slur at all," Steele said.
