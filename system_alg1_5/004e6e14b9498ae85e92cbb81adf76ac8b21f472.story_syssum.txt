"We're not just robots they send out there," umpire Tim McClelland (2nd from L) told author Bruce Weber.
He is, literally, the king of the hill.
Indeed, despite a library of books by and about pitchers (Jim Bouton's "Ball Four," Jim Brosnan's "The Long Season," Christy Mathewson's "Pitching in a Pinch"), Darling said he believes that people still don't understand what it takes to stand on that mound.
Weber immersed himself in the "land of umpires," as the book's subtitle calls it, attending umpiring school, calling games at various levels of pro ball and talking with those who were willing -- including the legendary Doug Harvey, who was called "God" for his imperious demeanor.
"That's really what [being an umpire] is about -- is being in charge," he said.
In these days of strict pitch counts and injury concern, pitchers are "undertrain[ed]," he says, noting that top draft choices climb the ranks "never allowed to throw more than 110 pitches."
"Identifying and preserving million-dollar arms are [the purview] of doctors, not baseball people."
Pitchers get more support than umpires, of course.
Though time has dulled the pain, "I think he lives with [that call] every day," Weber said.
People hate 'em, and they somehow perceive of umpiring as a flaw in the game, but I don't," he said.
"Umpires are people, too," veteran ump Tim McClelland told Weber.
