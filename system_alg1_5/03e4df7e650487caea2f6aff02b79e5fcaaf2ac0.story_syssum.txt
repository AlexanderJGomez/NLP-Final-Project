An especially bloody 10 days in Afghanistan's troubled Helmand province claimed 15 British lives, putting the total number of dead in that conflict at 184, the Defense Ministry said.
British troops have joined with roughly 4,000 U.S. Marines and sailors, and several hundred Afghan security forces, in Operation Khanjar, a drive to secure Helmand before Afghanistan's presidential elections in August.
"It's tough going because the Taliban have rightly identified Helmand as their vital ground," he said.
"Our resolution to complete the work that we have started in Afghanistan and Pakistan is undiminished," he said.
