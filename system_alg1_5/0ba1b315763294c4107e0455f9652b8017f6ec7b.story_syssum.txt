At that altitude, the thin air provides so little resistance that after just 40 seconds, he is expected to be free-falling faster than 690 miles an hour.
"There's a lot riding on that, so the main thing for us is making sure the probability is very high," Thompson said.
"For Felix, it's a lot of frustration," Thompson added.
Then he will climb out of the capsule, jump off the step with a bunny hop and form a crouched "delta" position to maximize his speed.
"You know, our records are meant to be broken, and I'm a very competitive person.
On a more serious note, he added, "Of course I'm afraid of dying, because I worked so hard to reach this level.
"You have to remember all the procedures," he said in an interview during testing for the jump.
You have to be focused.
Baumgartner was not doing interviews leading up to the jump, but his performance coach, Andy Walshe, described him as mentally well-prepared.
For example, he described what it feels like to fall through space when there is so little air: "There's no way you can tell how fast you're going, because there's no visual cues."
"He's advancing science, and he'll do a great job."
