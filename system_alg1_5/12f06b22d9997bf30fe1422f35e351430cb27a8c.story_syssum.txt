Anthony Marshall was convicted of bilking millions of dollars from the estate of his mother, Brooke Astor.
Marshall's former lawyer, Francis Morrissey, was convicted of all five counts against him, including forgery and scheming to defraud Astor.
Astor, who had Alzheimer's disease, was 105 when she died in August 2007.
Marshall, Astor's only child, was indicted on criminal charges in 2006.
Through her late husband's Vincent Astor Foundation, Brooke Astor is credited with giving New York, where the Astors made their fortune, about $200 million.
"I hope this brings some consolation and closure for the many people, including my grandmother's loyal staff, caregivers and friends, who helped when she was so vulnerable and so manipulated," Philip Marshall wrote.
