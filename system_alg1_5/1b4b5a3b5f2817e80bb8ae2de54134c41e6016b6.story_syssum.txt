Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Intense rain and gushing flood waters threatened Wednesday to cause more misery in monsoon-bloated Pakistan, where 3 million people are already suffering.
Thousands of others were people already displaced by violence in Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan, according to the United Nations refugee agency.
"We've been working hard over the past year to build a partnership with the people of Pakistan, and this is an essential element of that partnership -- reaching out and helping each other in times of need," Clinton said.
In some areas, Pakistanis complained the government has been sluggish to respond.
Meanwhile, limited access to clean water and poor hygienic conditions raised the threat of widespread acute respiratory infections, diarrhea and skin infections, said the medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres (also known as Doctors Without Borders), which is supporting health units in Mandrakhel, Wadpaga, and Gulbela in the Peshawar district, and the Paddi Hospital in the Nowshera district.
