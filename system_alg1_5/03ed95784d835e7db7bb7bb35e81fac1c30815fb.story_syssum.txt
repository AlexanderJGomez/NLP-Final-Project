Charles Engelhardt, who was a priest at St. Jerome Parish in northeast Philadelphia, died Saturday of multi-system organ failure and a complete heart blockage at 67, Father Kevin Nadolski said.
"I continue to believe that he's completely innocent," Father Nadolski said.
If you come forward, you will be heard," he said.
He is still being held in the Houtzdale, Pennsylvania State Prison.
