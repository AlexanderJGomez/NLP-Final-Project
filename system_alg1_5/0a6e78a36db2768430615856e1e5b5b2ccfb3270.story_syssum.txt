The most unexpected news of the day was a new name for the $499 fifth-generation iPad, which is now the iPad Air.
Physically, the iPad Air is indeed lighter and thinner than its predecessor.
Unfortunately, I didn't have an older iPad on hand to do a weight comparison, and I'd picked up an iPad Mini first.
The iPad Air has a 64-bit A7 processor, the same chip recently introduced in the iPhone 5S.
A number of Apple products already have the Retina Display: the iPhone 4S and up, the fourth generation iPod Touch, the 10-inch iPad and some MacBook Pros.
Like the iPad Air, the iPad Mini with Retina has the A7 chip inside.
Though other products can usually be had for much less, any hands-on time with Apple products remind you that one of their greatest selling points is solid, high-quality construction.
Both new iPads have the same M7 motion co-processor that handles sensors, such as the accelerometer and gyroscope, saving battery power by not using the main processor.
For now, Apple is comfortable enough with the competition to just iterate on its well-designed, popular products, making the usual round of improvements and throwing in the occasional flashy feature to grab attention, such as fingerprints on the iPhone 5S.
The competition will stay close until the first company breaks out of the usual faster, thinner, faster upgrade cycle and solves the battery problem.
