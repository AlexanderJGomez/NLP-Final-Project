The move prompted the Maoists' largest coalition partner to quit the government, the party's leader said.
"Without consensus, the ongoing peace process will not reach its logical conclusion and the drafting of the new constitution will not be possible," said Ishwor Pokharel, general secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist).
Pokharel said his party urged the Maoists not to fire Katawal without a consensus in the country's parliament.
The Maoists hold 238 of the 601 seats in parliament, while Pokharel's party has 109.
