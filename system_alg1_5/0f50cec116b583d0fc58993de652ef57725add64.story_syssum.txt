Caroline Wimmer, 26, was found by her parents, Ronald and Martha, after she was strangled with a hair-dryer cord in March 2009 in Staten Island, New York.
The parents are also suing their daughter's convicted murderer, Calvin Lawson, paramedic Musarella, the city of New York and Greenleaf Arms Incorporated -- the company that owns the apartment building where Wimmer's body was found.
Connie Pankratz, a spokeswoman for the city's law department, called the situation "tragic."
Wimmer's murderer, Lawson, is serving 25 years-to-life.
