FARC had signaled that it would pursue a cease-fire, even before peace talks, now being held in Havana, began in mid-October in Norway.
The leftist FARC, or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, has been at war with the government since the 1960s, making it the longest-running insurgency in Latin America.
To achieve it, we have to go deep into the transformation of society," said Humberto de la Calle, a representative for the Colombian government.
Ivan Marquez, a FARC representative, agreed.
While the Colombian government has said that the FARC could continue to advocate for its positions as a political force, it does not want to negotiate all the group's demands during the peace talks.
