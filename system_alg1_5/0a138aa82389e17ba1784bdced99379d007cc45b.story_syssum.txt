Rick Perry's decision to send up to 1,000 National Guard troops to the southern border is the latest move in a controversy over the influx of migrant youths from Central America, many unaccompanied, streaming into the United States.
The National Guard will be a "force multiplier" to aid state law enforcement to reduce crime from cartels, traffickers and criminals crossing the border, Perry said.
So what will the border patrol do?
They will also patrol the border by air, especially at night.
"If we were asked to, we could detain people, but we're not planning to," Nichols said.
"The real solution to basically helping border patrol is going to be a holistic approach to this that goes way beyond more boots on the ground," said David Aguilar, the acting commissioner of CBP from 2011 until 2013.
Perry is asking the federal government to hire and train an additional 3,000 border patrol agents to replace the National Guard.
He previewed his National Guard plan in Iowa, a key presidential nominating state, over the weekend and announced it the next day.
Has the National Guard been sent to the border before?
The Rio Grande sector, where most of the immigrant children are turning themselves into the border patrol, currently has 3,000 border patrol agents covering 320 miles of land and 250 miles of water, which equates to 5.4 agents per mile.
And the amount spent on border security has more than doubled.
