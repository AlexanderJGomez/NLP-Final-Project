"Argo," which cost $45 million to make, has now earned $60.8 million total, and thanks to terrific word-of-mouth (the film earned an "A+" CinemaScore grade) and early awards buzz, Argo is eyeing a $100 million finish.
("The Town," which opened higher "Argo" with $23.8 million, fell 38 percent to $9.7 million in its third weekend.)
With $130.4 million total, Hotel is already Sony Pictures Animation's highest grossing film ever, above Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, which grossed $124.9 million in 2009.
"Cloud Atlas" cost a whopping $100 million, and it has no chance of making that money back â€” at least not in the States.
"Taken 2" took fifth place, sliding 40 percent to $8.0 million, which gives Fox's $45 million action thriller a $117.4 million total.
In its fourth weekend, "Taken," which opened with half of what Taken 2 made, earned $11.3 million.

Open Road's $20 million videogame adaptation/horror sequel "Silent Hill: Revelation 3D" started in sixth place with $8.0 million.
The $14 million film garnered a "B" CinemaScore grade from crowds, which were 67 percent female and 61 percent below the age of 18.
The film grossed $77.7 million from 25 territories, including $32.4 million from the U.K. (where the film set a new attendance record on Saturday), $9.1 million from France, and $8.6 million from Russia.
