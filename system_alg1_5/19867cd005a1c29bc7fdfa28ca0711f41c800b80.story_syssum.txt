"Today, thanks to the sovereign decision of the Dominican people, I am the president of all Dominicans," Medina wrote.
That is my main goal -- to have a population that is able to go shopping, to have the capacity to consume," he said.
Since the end of Mejia's term in 2004, the presidency has been held by Leonel Fernandez, of the centrist Dominican Liberation Party, the same party that Medina belongs to.
Mejia, 71, the former president, has a background in agriculture.
Medina, 60, was elected to four-year terms as a lawmaker in 1986, 1990 and 1994.
