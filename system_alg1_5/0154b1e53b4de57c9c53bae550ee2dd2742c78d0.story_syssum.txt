In France, and especially in Paris, the mood over the past two weeks has been subdued, but punctured by public displays of solidarity across faiths.
One of France's most renowned philosophers, Voltaire published his "Treatise on Tolerance" in 1763.
When first published, the "Treatise" was a revolutionary creed, and one that landed Voltaire in trouble with the French government and especially powerful religious interests, such as the Jesuits.
"I say that we should regard all men as our brothers," he wrote.
Voltaire wrote the "Treatise" because he was outraged by the execution of a Protestant man, Jean Calas, who was wrongly convicted of murdering his own son to prevent him from converting to Catholicism.
"We can draw anything, including a prophet, because in France, the France of Voltaire and irreverence, we have the right to make fun of religions," she said.
Scattered around them, among the many tributes, posters of the writer bordered with the motto: "Je suis Charlie."
In the words of the Societe's Alain Sager: "The border today is not between the religious and the atheist, between the Christian and non-Christian, Muslim and non-Muslim, between the Jewish and non-Jewish.
Two-hundred-fifty years later, the words have new resonance.
