"We had goals," she says.
"It's an alternative to living beyond our means, really," Brett says.
"Times in the construction industry have been really tough, and four months ago I lost my job as a recruiter and as a trainer," Vicky says.

"I love the idea of having a debit card and paying as you go," Mark says.
There are even leftovers, which can be used for Mark's lunches.
