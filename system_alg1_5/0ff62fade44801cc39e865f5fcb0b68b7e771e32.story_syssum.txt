(CNN) -- This week's devastating crash of a high-speed train in Spain, which left nearly 80 dead, has drawn renewed attention to rail safety at a time when the Obama administration has prioritized the construction of fast new rail links.
The trains will be fast.
And in 2011, two of China's newest, fastest trains slammed into one another, killing 40 people.
The bullet trains that zoom through France and Japan, for instance, testify to the astonishing safety offered by well-managed rail services.
Yet thanks to advanced safety systems and extensive maintenance, no passengers -- zero -- have died as a result of a high-speed train crash in either country.
Unfortunately, that train in Spain did not use that system.
No more sitting in traffic, grinding teeth at the wheel.
Train service similar to that already offered in European and Asian countries would require a significant investment, but for many routes, an improved rail system is a worthy endeavor.
