"We train every day for five, six hours, but not only playing tennis," the 30-year-old told reporters after setting up a tie with world No.
"First time I was training with him, I was so excited, but after three days, I was dying.
"I called him and said, 'Carlos is crazy'.
"But between husband and the coach, it is very tough.
They asked me, 'Li Na, we hear you are divorced.'
"She's a tough player," Li said of Radwanska, who had not dropped a set this year before the match.
If you hit slow or short, she'll attack."
"Well, going into the match, my goal is not really to be tested," joked Sharapova, who lost last year's final against world No.
