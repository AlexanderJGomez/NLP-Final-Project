She wanted to tell more, but she was too ashamed.
She explains it as, 'They got me,' " says Sherrlyn Borkgren, who spent a month in the Democratic Republic of the Congo late last year.
"She said she was 15 when she was raped," Borkgren says.
"It is one of the worst places in the world to be a woman or girl," says Anneke Van Woudenberg, a senior researcher with Human Rights Watch who has spent the last 10 years focusing on Congo.
"Sometimes, that is done in front of the family, in front of the children," Van Woudenberg says.
"Soldiers have committed gang rapes, rapes leading to injury and death, and abductions of girls and women," a report released last month by Human Rights Watch says.
"If you rape, you get away with it," she says.
"The brutality has increased on a huge scale," Van Woudenberg says.
"They asked me to take off my clothes, and I did.
In 2006, its parliament passed a law criminalizing rape, with penalties ranging from five to 20 years.
"It's expected that a trial could happen soon," said U.N. spokesman Yves Sorokobi.
Borkgren, the photographer from Eugene, Oregon, says she went to the Congo after having a dream in which two women yelled at her to "come over here."
She hitchhiked her way around the country, something she now admits was "a little bit stupid."
"That was interesting," she says.
"She would say, 'I don't understand what it is, and I don't know what words to use.'
The soldiers and rebels carrying out the rapes, she says, are misguided people who need help.
Caught in the middle are the innocents: women, girls and fathers struggling to get justice.
