Chandrapur, India (CNN) -- My latest film, "Mary Kom" is about to hit the screens.
The girls I met are part of the Building Young Futures program, or Deepshikha as it is locally known, run in partnership with UNICEF, Barclays and the Government of Maharashtra.
With support, opportunities and a lot of hard work I've been able to make them happen.
Games like these, alongside Barclays volunteers sharing their financial knowledge, are what help the girls plan, set up and develop their own enterprises.
I was truly inspired.
Alongside all this, add a bit of magic, encouraging the girls to share their new power and use it to do good for the community.
It's a real, tangible, positive effect where is there for all to see.
As I was leaving, her father told me she had become the son he never had.
With programs like Building Young Futures, these positive stories and messages will only grow in number.
