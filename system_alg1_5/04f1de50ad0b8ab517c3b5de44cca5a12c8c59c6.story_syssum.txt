Though the institute considers Cordoba the front-runner, no single candidate has emerged as the clear-cut favorite, as sometimes happens, said Kristian Berg Harpviken, director of the peace institute.
The 50-year-old peace institute, which is often called PRIO, has no connection with the Nobel committee that awards the peace prize.
Cordoba, 54, heads Colombians for Peace, a group trying to end to the 45-year-old war between the government and the guerrilla Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC.
"I do realize that this created some debate in Colombia," he said.
"Certainly, the purpose ... he stands for makes him very strong," Harpviken said.
The letter, PRIO said, was partly a response to Pope Benedict XVI's 2006 lecture that many saw as an attack on Islam.
If Muhammad does not win, Harpviken said, it could be because his work is not done.
Quang Do, 80, was awarded the annual human rights prize by the Rafto Foundation of Norway in 2006.
Chinese dissidents Hu Jia, Gao Zhisheng and Wei Jingsheng also are contenders, other observers said.
Gao, who was born in 1966, is a self-taught lawyer and People's Liberation Army veteran who was a Nobel Peace Prize candidate last year.
"I ask to you to seriously consider the true value of morality, justice, and humanity, as well as to what extent such values are undermined in China," he said.
The other four prizes are for physiology or medicine, physics, chemistry and literature.
While the other prizes are awarded by committees based in Sweden, the peace prize is determined by a five-member panel appointed by the Norwegian parliament.
