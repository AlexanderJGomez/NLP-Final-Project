Such claims are "demonstrably false," said Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR).
"Except for a tiny minority," extremists have found "no fertile ground in America," he said.
"New York is the epicenter, and I'm not aware of any tips that have been given in Nassau, Suffolk [counties] or New York City," he said.
"I won't demonize anyone," he said.
In an earlier interview on CNN's "American Morning," King promised a "thoughtful, meaningful, very fair hearing" and insisted he was not condemning Islam as a religion or American Muslims as a group.
But he added, "There is a very small percentage who have allied themselves with al Qaeda," and he said U.S. Muslim leaders "do not face up to that reality."
But King, however, has defended his efforts, calling the IRA "a legitimate force" for decades.
"Homegrown terrorism is a serious, but limited, problem," they asserted.
Critics such as King, however, point to a number of recent examples of alleged homegrown terrorism as evidence of a dangerous trend, including the case of Army Maj. Nidal Hassan, a psychiatrist charged with killing 13 people at Fort Hood in 2009.
"To suggest that we don't face a threat is wrong," Cilluffo noted.
