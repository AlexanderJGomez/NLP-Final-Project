AUSTIN, Texas (CNN) -- Monday, in the much anticipated New Haven, Connecticut, firefighters' case, the Supreme Court reversed an opinion joined by Judge Sonia Sotomayor, President Obama's Supreme Court nominee.
By a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court reversed, holding that Watts' supposed threats were really nothing but hyperbole.
More significantly, after Burger had been confirmed, the Court reversed him again, this time in a major case -- Powell v. McCormack.
Beginning with the presidency of Ronald Reagan, Republicans have taken aim at affirmative action, and the Republican justices have concurred.
That was enough for Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a Republican, who switched from her normal skepticism of affirmative action to sustain the law school program.
With those cases as background, the majority's sympathy for the plight of Frank Ricci, who studied so hard for the New Haven promotion examination, was easily predictable.
It is merely a coincidence that the nominee, Sotomayor, happened to participate in the case already.
