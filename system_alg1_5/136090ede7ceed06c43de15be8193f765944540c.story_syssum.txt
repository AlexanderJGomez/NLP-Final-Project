"But four or five days later," he began to exhibit them, Frieden said.
He also declined to say, clearly, whether the patient is a man, although he referred to the person as "he" on multiple occasions.
The patient is believed to have had a handful of contacts with people after showing symptoms of the virus, and before being isolated, Frieden said.
Frieden, too, sought to play down the risk to public health.
"It's a severe disease, which has a high-case fatality rate, even with the best of care, but there are core, tried and true public health interventions that stop it," Frieden said.
"And if they have a fever, they are pulled out of the line, assessed for Ebola and don't fly unless Ebola is ruled out."
The same report stated that there had been 6,553 cases of the virus overall, though the number is suspected to be much higher, given difficulties in tracking and reporting the disease.
But I also have no doubt that as long as the outbreak continues in Africa, we need to be on our guard," said Frieden.
