Inspired by her older brother, George, 14, Caroline started playing Pop Warner flag football at age 5 and was hooked.
"She should be allowed to play," said Ross, who also coaches football at a nearby high school.
There are 46 football programs, each with junior varsity and varsity teams, under the Archdiocese of Philadelphia CYO.
"Not only am I not going to be able to play, but girls all over aren't going to be able to sign up," she said.
"Traditionally, football is a boys only sport due to its full contact nature.
"We didn't make a big deal about it," said Reichwein.
"This whole fight is for other people more than it is for her," he said.
"The sport will determine where's she's best able to play, if she is at all."
"She's trying really hard to let girls play football," she said.
After calls and e-mails to the archdiocese were unsuccessful, Caroline, no longer welcome to play football for the CYO, decided to call an audible.
"The archdiocese is one of the last remaining defenders of gender discriminating in sports, so let us proudly take a giant leap forward in Catholic education today by purging this archaic rule from the CYO handbook," he wrote.
"I admire your love of the game, Caroline, and I'm impressed by your zeal in pursuing the opportunity to play it," he wrote.
The chiding seems to ignore that Caroline's parents wrote the archdiocese, to no avail, before taking their daughter's cause public, the Plas said.
