Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Amid the overwhelming flood disaster in Pakistan, the world has "no choice but to be optimistic and to have hope" that things can improve there, actress and humanitarian Angelina Jolie told CNN Wednesday.
And in a moment, a few hours, it was completely gone."
Almost 21 million people have been affected by the flooding, Valerie Amos, the new U.N. emergency relief coordinator, said Monday.
One reason relatively few people have paid attention to the suffering in Pakistan, Jolie said, may be disaster fatigue.
They are family, and lovely, lovely, hard-working people and beautiful children, and they deserve dignity and assistance, and we have to treat them with respect and try to preserve what we can of their livelihood and their future."
"I think without that, we are just lost, and things deteriorate."
