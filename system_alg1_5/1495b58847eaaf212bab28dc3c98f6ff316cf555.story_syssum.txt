Jaycee Dugard, here at the 1991 Rose Bowl parade, was abducted later that year.
In Illinois, Shannon Wilfong is charged with child abduction, allegedly having forced 6-year-old Richard K. Wilfong Chekevdia to live in seclusion and be hidden, at times in crawl spaces and the attic, for nearly two years, according to court documents.
Dugard is spending time in "a secluded place, reconnecting" with her mother and younger sister, said her aunt, Tina Dugard, in a statement on behalf of her family.
"She's going to have a lot of mixed feelings about returning to her family of origin because she's spent almost two decades with a different family," said Margo Napoletano, a child and family psychologist in San Diego, California.
"You get to know this world you live in -- it may be a terrible world, but it's the world you know," he said.
But Johanna Tabin, a psychologist in Glencoe, Illinois, said Dugard's readjustment will depend on how she was treated in captivity.
At the same time, someone in Dugard's situation may have asked herself at the outset, "Why did they let me get kidnapped?"
The situation is likely also difficult for Dugard's two daughters, born to her in captivity, who have never met Dugard's family before, Napoletano said.
Dugard's reuniting with her family could also be likened to a soldier coming back from a "hellacious war," Lebow said.
When service members come home, they may find life "shallower," and feel that they are not the same people as when they left, she said.
Waking up in the morning, going grocery shopping, washing clothes and doing other day-to-day activities help create a stable, comforting environment, she said.
