Gunn, a software engineer, said he and his girlfriend, who is also white, lived upstairs; their 31-year-old landlord lived downstairs.
"Days later, the owner posted a sign on the gate to the pool which read, 'Public Swimming Pool, White Only.'"
She said the sign, which was dated 1931 and from Alabama, was a gift from a friend.
He said he never confronted Hein about the matter, but has no doubt that the sign was intended for his daughter.
