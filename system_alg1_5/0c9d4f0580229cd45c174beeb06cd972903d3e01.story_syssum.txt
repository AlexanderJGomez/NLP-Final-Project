(CNN) -- Two 5-year-old boys, one with autism, were having some friendly playtime when they had a communication breakdown.
The reason is they are tools, not miracles," said Shannon Rosa, an author and former educational software producer who has written about using tablets with her own son, Leo, who has autism.
Now app creators, autism educators and parents are exploring new ways of using tablets and apps to work with the 1 in 68 kids in the U.S. with autism.
Rosa said it allows her son, now 13, to think visually, to interact with content directly without the cognitive hurdle of a mouse, and it breaks complex concepts up into more easily understandable chunks.
Rosa, though, like many parents, is careful about letting her son have too much screen time.
Released on the iPad in April, it's a live-action comedy show that aims to educate children by being entertaining, not condescending.
"Typically, how this stuff has been taught is giving kids scripts saying, 'Say this when you meet someone,'" said the show's creator, Christa Dahlstrom.
"(Technology) can make a profound difference to the kids with autism, but it's not like it's a cure for it," Dahlstrom said.
"In terms of apps for kids with autism and special needs, there's a lot of stuff for preschoolers.
Tablets have replaced a number of other tools for parents and educators, including handmade visual aids, expensive communication devices and, increasingly, TVs.
Making cue cards is a common technique when working with nonverbal children, but it requires taking photos, uploading them to computers, printing them out, laminating them, adding some velcro and sticking them on boards.
"We've really started to see children's media migrate from the TV screen to the iPad," said Dahlstrom.
