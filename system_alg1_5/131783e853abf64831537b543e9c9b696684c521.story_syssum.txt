In infamy, just as he did in fame, Armstrong continues to hold powerful sway over the public's consciousness.
"I was a keen cyclist, cycling three or four days weeks and doing a 90-kilometer ride on a Sunday," the work's creator "Plastic Jesus" told CNN, explaining why he was moved to labor for several hours in his spare time with his scalpel to produce the two stencils that were used to create the Armstrong exhibit.
"Plastic Jesus," who chose that tag due to his atheism, previously ran a news photography agency in London that dealt with Britain's major newspapers -- hence his experience of covering riots.
"The art is in the message -- it's not about the technical quality of the piece," said the 48-year-old.
has been creating quite a buzz," says Greg Linton, editor-in-chief of the street art blog Melrose and Fairfax.
