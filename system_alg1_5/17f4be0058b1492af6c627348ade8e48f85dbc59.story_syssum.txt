Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN)  -- Argentina's capital city was beset by strikes Thursday, with teachers, doctors and transit employees refusing to work over money matters.
They are protesting "the lack of money in the public system, the possibility that the health budget will be reduced by 500 million pesos (about $130 million), the lack of professionals, the lack of labor to solve the problems in Argentina's public health," said Alicia Kobylarz of the Federal Syndicate of Health Workers.
"Provinces that have petroleum income, for example, are provinces that have better budgets, that have better hospitals" said Aldo Neri, a former national health minister.
"The province's posture is very clear: There won't be raises in 2009 because there already have been," Oporto told a radio station, according to Telam.
They, too, want pay raises.
Pablo Zalaquett, the mayor of Santiago, the capital of Chile, said the two sides are closer on a pay bonus the professors want.
