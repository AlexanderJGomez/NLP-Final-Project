Ibrahim, who is eight months pregnant, is a Christian, her husband said.
I don't know what to do," said her husband, Daniel Wani.
Her father left when she was age 6, and she was raised by her mother as a Christian.
However, the lawyer representing Ibrahim's family said Sunday that the mother is a devout Muslim.
However, because her father was Muslim, the courts considered her one too, which would mean her marriage to a non-Muslim man is void.
She's having a difficult pregnancy, and a request to send her to a private hospital was denied, the lawyer said.
Foreign embassies in Khartoum, including those of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, urged the government to reverse course.
