"The fishing industry has slowed from a full-time job to just a couple months a year," said Doug Monk, the captain of the boat from which Woodside dives.
But thanks to a small piece of the federal stimulus recovery plan, Monk, Woodside and about 40 other fishermen will get back to work hauling in a very different catch: lost fishing nets.
The nets, some of which extend larger than a football field, can also tangle the propellers of boats and pose a danger to scuba divers.
It would be immediate," said Broadhurst.
When the divers find the fields of nets, they begin the labor of cutting them free piece by piece and all by hand.
In just a few hours on the water, the divers can pull free about 1,000 pounds of nets.
The divers seal them in heavy duty plastic bags and, once on shore, take the nets to a landfill.
But, the boat captain said, recovering the fishing nets has greater meaning than just riding out a rough economy.
