Several hundred people gathered in this suburban community, some 25 miles northeast of San Francisco, with supporters of former officer Johannes Mehserle joined by critics, who said they were calling for justice for his victim, Oscar Grant.
"Free Mehserle," some said.
They said there were no arrests.
"There were no acts of violence.
Mehserle, who is white, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the 2009 shooting death of Grant, an unarmed black man who was on a train platform at the Fruitvale station in nearby Oakland.
They said in a news release they want to make clear that "justice means that Grant's killer, Mehserle, stays in jail and they throw away the key."
Maybe Oscar was too loud, too proud, too Black.
"I work across the street from the Superior Court, and I'm not concerned at all."
Officers pulled several men, including Grant, off the train when it arrived at Fruitvale.
The Oakland demonstrations began peacefully but were followed by some violence, including vandalism.
