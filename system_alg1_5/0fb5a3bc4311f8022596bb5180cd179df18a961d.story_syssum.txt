A day earlier, suspected drone strikes targeted al Qaeda fighters in Yemen for the second time in two days, killing "at least a dozen," the government official said.
"It's too early to tell how many militants were killed, but the number is at least a dozen," the official said.
"These strikes destroyed the training facility completely and killed both Yemeni and foreign members," it said.
Al Qaeda operatives had fled to the area after a 2012 push by government troops, backed by the United States, he said.
"At this hour, the numbers of militants being reported as being killed keeps changing, and we still aren't sure if any civilians have been killed or wounded in these strikes."
Those strikes have killed somewhere between 700 and 1,000 people, including at least 81 civilians, the foundation says.
