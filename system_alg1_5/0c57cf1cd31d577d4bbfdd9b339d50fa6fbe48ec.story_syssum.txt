Mueller was arrested in Aspen, Colorado, on December 3 and charged with assault and cocaine possession, police said.
Mueller, 34, checked into the rehab facility before the announcement was made, he said.
Mueller was found and arrested after midnight at another bar, Escobar, police said.
Last December, her attorney, Yale Galanter, said that she entered a sober living facility.
Earlier, in April 2010, Mueller had checked into a treatment facility for help with stress management to prevent a "return to old problems," her representative said.
