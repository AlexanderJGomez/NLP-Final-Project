And I think, between him, the fumes and walking around, maybe picking up pieces or something, he got what is rarely a thing to deal with, but it's Kawasaki syndrome," Travolta said of his then-2-year-old son.
Someone with Kawasaki could have seizures for one of two reasons, but they would be rare, he said.
