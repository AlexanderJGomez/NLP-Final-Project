"These technologies should be in place to empower citizens, not to repress them," Obama said of the measure, which targets the Syrian and Iranian governments, as well as companies that provide them with high-tech equipment to use against their own people.
"Across government, alert channels will make sure that information about unfolding crises and dissenting opinions reach decision-makers, including me," Obama said.
Obama has come under heavy criticism on foreign policy issues recently from Republicans, including his certain opponent in the November election, Mitt Romney, and the president's comments appeared aimed at defending a range of acts by his administration that he said saved "countless lives" around the world.
"Today I can announce that our advisers will continue their efforts to bring this madman to justice and to save lives," Obama said.
"How is it that the Holocaust number one denier -- Ahmadinejad -- is still a president," Wiesel said in introducing Obama.
Romney, in a speech earlier this year to the pro-Israel group AIPAC, excoriated the administration's "policy of engagement with Iran," but erroneously asserted the president had opposed sanctions against Iran at that point.
