The future of transport is self-driving cars, says GPS inventor Bradford Parkinson.
If there is anyone who should know about the future of GPS, it is Brad Parkinson.
Initially, the military was resistant to the idea, says Parkinson.
According to Parkinson, there are myriad possible uses for GPS that are yet to be explored, but one of the most immediate applications will be the integration of GPS technology into self-driving cars, which he believes will help bring down the incidence of road accidents.
This is really exciting.
I can do all that in an integrated single package, so I think where this is going is robotic automobiles."
In September 2012, California legalized self-driving vehicles.
Experts predict that the first self-driving cars may be on the roads by 2016.
