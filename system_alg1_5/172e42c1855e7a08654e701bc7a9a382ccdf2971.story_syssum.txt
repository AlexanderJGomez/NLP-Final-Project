Stephen Shadley's Oscar green room was inspired by his renovation of a 1970s home.
"I've sort of been captivated by the movies," Shadley said, warming up after landing in Los Angeles less than an hour before.
"It's the 1970s.
But the focal point for the room is one of Shadley's personal touches.
"I'm hoping it will transport people a little, give them the illusion that they're actually in this [spacious] room, rather than a green room backstage," Shadley said.
