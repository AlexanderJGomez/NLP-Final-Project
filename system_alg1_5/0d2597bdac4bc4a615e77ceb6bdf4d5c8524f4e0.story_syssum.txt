Klein represented dozens of artists, including Sam Cooke, the Animals, Bobby Darin and Herman's Hermits.
Known for a tenacious and often blunt style in negotiations, Klein's greatest coups were inking contracts with the Rolling Stones and the Beatles, though both relationships ended in legal battles.
Klein is survived by his wife Betty, their three children and four grandchildren.
Services will be held in New York on Tuesday.
