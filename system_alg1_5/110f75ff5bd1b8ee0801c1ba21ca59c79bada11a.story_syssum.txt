The Leadership Conference of Women Religious, initially surprised by the Vatican's report last month, "plans to move slowly, not rushing to judgment" when the group's 21-member board meets for three days in Washington, D.C., beginning Tuesday.
Simone Campbell, a nun who's executive director of Network, a national Catholic social justice lobby in Washington, said her "hunch" is that the LCWR will put together an outline response this week to be presented to the group's full assembly during its August meeting.
Nuns in various orders around the United States have been conversing about the Vatican report, and their reactions have been "surprised, stunned, shocked," Campbell said.
Other people do those works," Campbell said.
"Basically, it needs to be more obedient," said Allen, who's also a senior correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, based in Kansas City, Missouri.
"That's what on the table here: How do the nuns want to respond to the crackdown that they received from the Vatican," Allen added.
"One way or another, it's an important crossroads moment," he added.
This life is profound and deep," Campbell said.
"We're open to the Holy Spirit and to let the group wisdom lead us, so I have no idea" on whether on a position will be taken by the order, Campbell said.
