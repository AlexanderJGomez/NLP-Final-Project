(WIRED)  -- When Microsoft and Facebook announced that they were partnering to integrate Facebook and Bing for social network-powered search, it confirmed something I thought Monday: Windows Phone 7 is the real Facebook phone.
Every aspect of Windows Phone 7 is geared to social networks: phone, contacts, gaming, photos, even Office.
Microsoft tried to explicitly build a social networking phone featuring Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and MySpace with the Kin.
They were always there.
It's the exact strategy that Zuckerberg outlined in his interview with Michael Arrington, where he explained why Facebook wasn't building its own phone.
"We started thinking what would social search look like, and we started looking around for partners," Zuckerberg said.
In order to get outside of itself, Microsoft partnered with Facebook early on -- it still owns part of the company -- and Facebook helped shape Microsoft's social strategy.
Facebook is already embedded in all of them: It's built into Messenger, Hotmail and Outlook, and it's what powers part of the social dimension of Xbox Live.
It's about incorporating a social layer into media on every device in your household, from your phone to your set-top box.
If we think about Apple's attempt with Ping to bring a social layer to iTunes (which has been criticized, in part, because Apple didn't partner up with Facebook), Sony's idea of a multitasking television set or Twitter's plays to get on the television screen with Google TV, it's clear that that's where we're heading.
The only places where Microsoft and Facebook are "underdogs" are search and smartphones.
