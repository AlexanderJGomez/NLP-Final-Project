"She's definitely not your average manicurist," says Denise Abrahams, a longtime client.
"I don't work with my head," she says.
Born in Feres Mai, a large village in northern Ethiopia, Schaefer moved to the United States in the mid-1970s when civil war broke out at home.
"That really pushed me to do it," she says, "to build a school so that wouldn't happen again."
"I was working two days for the school, four days for me," she recalls.
To finish the school, she needed to do something drastic.
Schaefer ultimately raised more than $250,000 for the school, which was completed in 2006.
"It's simple, but it's nice," Schaefer says.
Schaefer's next goal is to equip the school with computers.
"She's very inspiring to me," says Gonzalez.
