Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Two explosions rocked an anti-government protest in the Thai capital of Bangkok on Friday, wounding more than two dozen people, security and health officials said.
Roughly 12,000 protesters were on the streets Friday, Paradon said.
But the situation wasn't too chaotic, he said.
Since demonstrations against Yingluck's government began in November, eight people have died and more than 450 have been wounded, according to authorities.
Protest leaders have said they want to rid Thailand of the influence of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the older brother of Yingluck.
If he returns, he risks a two-year prison sentence on a corruption conviction, which he says was politically motivated.
His supporters, known as "red shirts," support the holding of elections on February 2.
