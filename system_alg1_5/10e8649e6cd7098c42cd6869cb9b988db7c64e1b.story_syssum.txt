(CNN) -- I was born in Tallahassee, Florida, in 1954, the year of the landmark school desegregation case, Brown v. Board of Education.
Eventually our sons, and even my parents, moved to Atlanta, too.
And not just in the South, but across the United States.
At most highly segregated white schools, middle-class students are in the majority.
Conversely, academic performance is likely to improve if the student attends a middle-class school, even if his or her own family is poor.
In particular, white children will need to be in schools that are intentional about helping them understand social justice issues like prejudice, discrimination and racism, empowering them to think critically about the stereotypes to which they are exposed in the culture.
When we can answer that question, the promise of Brown v. Board of Education will be fulfilled.
