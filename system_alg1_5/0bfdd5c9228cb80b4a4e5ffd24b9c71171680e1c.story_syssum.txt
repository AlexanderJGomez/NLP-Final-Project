(CNN)After days of vehemently denying claims in the media, high-profile lawyer Alan Dershowitz wants a judge to step in -- specifically, to "strike the allegations" against him of sexual misconduct involving teenage girls.
Referring to one of his clients by the name used for her in court documents, Cassell added, "Jane Doe #3, however, has been viciously attacked by Mr. Dershowitz.
In a written statement Wednesday, Dershowitz said the suit will require depositions from Cassell, Edwards, Jane Doe #3 and him.
"I hope they will not try to hide behind litigation and other privileges, so that the truth will come out," he said.
"Never under any circumstance have I ever had any sexual contact of any kind, which includes massages or any physical contact whatsoever, with Jane Doe #3," he added.
