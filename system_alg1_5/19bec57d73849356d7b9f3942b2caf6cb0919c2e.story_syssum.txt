When U.S. bobsledder Bill Schuffenhauer was a child in Salt Lake City, Utah, he had no idea the Olympics even existed.
He had few friends, most of them acquaintances of his mother or the other street kids, many of whom were in gangs.
"I knew that there was something better," Schuffenhauer, 36, said last week as he readied for his third Olympic Games.
"She reminded me to never give up and always push on," he said.
Fueled by that dream, he worked hard in school and in becoming a decathlete.
He was crushed, but as he will often remind you, his upbringing, or lack thereof, taught him to be strong.
He had two children and a girlfriend, Ruthann Savage, whom he met in 2004, and he felt responsible for them.
That worked for two years, until the desire to compete came back when he saw the team racing at Park City.
"It's been amazing that she's been able to stand by me," he said of Savage, now his fianc√©e.
But with the economy in free fall, he barely sold any tickets.
It got worse.
I'm here.
That's all I wanted," he said.
Heroes are teachers and doctors, he said.
