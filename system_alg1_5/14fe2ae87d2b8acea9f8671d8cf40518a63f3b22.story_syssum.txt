The mother of a teen with autism who went missing three weeks ago declared Friday, "My son, he is alive."
"I don't know what the commissioner was thinking of last night by saying that, but my son, he is alive, he is out there ...it's just that we are not looking in the right places," Fontaine told reporters.
Avonte is fascinated by trains, his family has said.
"My message to my son is that I love him, and we're going to find him," she said.
Police said Avonte was last seen wearing a gray striped shirt, black jeans and black sneakers.
