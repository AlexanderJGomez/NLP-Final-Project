One upside to her time away from the tour, though, is that she was able to squeeze in an appearance on The CW's "Hart of Dixie," which returns for a second season Tuesday.
I've always been drawn to it and I've always wanted to pursue it, just like gymnastics," she said.
"I really like Angelina Jolie, all the jobs that she's done," she said, pointing to Jolie's turn in the action thriller "Salt" as a favorite.
"It was my first time ever doing anything like that," Maroney said.
"Gymnastics, you're in the gym eight hours a day and acting, that's a full-time job as well.
"I've done acting classes before, and school plays, and I've always loved it," she added.
She's also lined up a guest actor role on "Pretty Little Liars" (as a huge fan, she said, "I kind of always thought that it was Toby" who was the elusive "A"), which she hopes to shoot at some point in the future.
"Right now, I'm only 16, and gymnastics will always be a part of me," she said of her future plans.
So I'll really be getting into trying to work for the next Olympics, and in between that I'll be doing, hopefully, little things like what I just did."
