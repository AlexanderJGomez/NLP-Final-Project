Israel's attorney general said Wednesday that Shin Bet, the country's internal security force, can search a foreign traveler's e-mail, but only in exceptional cases in which "relevant suspicious signs" are observed.
"A tourist who has just spent thousands of dollars to travel to Israel, only to be interrogated at the airport by Shin Bet agents and told to grant access to their e-mail account, is in no position to give free and informed consent," she said Wednesday.
"Such 'consent,' given under threat of deportation, cannot serve as a basis for such a drastic invasion of privacy.
However, if we do receive any groups with some people who are originally from Iran or from Syria, they are detained for several hours and asked to sign a paper not to cause any harm to the state of Israel during their visit."
