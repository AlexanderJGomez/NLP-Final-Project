Bernice King says her brothers' plan to sell their father's Bible and the Nobel Peace Prize he was awarded 1964.
King was assassinated in 1968, and his widow, Coretta Scott King, died in 2006.
Bernice King, who was 5 when her father was assassinated, is acting as the "gatekeeper" to her father's property, said attorney William Hill, who represents the King estate.
According to the King brothers' complaint, King's heirs agreed in 1995 to give up their inheritance to the Estate of Martin Luther King Jr. Inc., but Bernice King has "secreted and sequestered" the items in question.
Bernice King and Martin Luther King III sued Dexter King in 2008, accusing him of converting "substantial funds from the estate's financial account at Bank of America" for his own use.
