"We believe that the lawsuit should be filed in another court and, therefore, the lawsuit that was on file was dismissed without prejudice," she told CNN.
John Doe #1, who said that Travolta sexually harassed him at the Beverly Hills Hotel, hired Allred on Tuesday, just hours after he withdrew from Okorocha's lawsuit.
That dismissal was "without prejudice, which means that he is still legally entitled to file a lawsuit against John Travolta if he chooses," Allred said.
"Mr. Okorocha's representations are false, outrageous and defamatory," Allred said Wednesday.
"Clients come to me," Allred said.
"If Travolta doesn't take responsibility, I'm going to file those cases," he said.
