The CDC is working to confirm the diagnosis.
Dr. Tom Frieden, the director of the CDC, told reporters Sunday that the health care worker who appears to have contracted in Ebola was infected because of a breach in protocols.
"With the Ebola virus, you never relax completely, but we think he has made great progress," said Dr. Phil Smith with The Nebraska Medical Center, where Mukpo is being treated.
"The NBC crew remains symptom-free, so there is no reason for concern of exposure to the community," it read.
"That screening went smoothly," Frieden said Sunday.
The numbers were reported from Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Spain and the United States.
Teresa Romero Ramos, a nurse's assistant in Spain who is the first person to contract Ebola outside Africa, "is conscious and talking" but was in "stable but serious" condition Saturday after taking a turn for the worse earlier in the week.
But the risk of spread, it said, is avoidable and extremely low.
