Yet there was brush-fire-level rage on and off the Internet -- see #OscarsSoWhite -- following Thursday morning's announcement of this year's Academy Award nominations over the fact that "Selma," the critically acclaimed drama about Martin Luther King Jr.'s epochal campaign for voting rights in the South, received only two Oscar nods, one of them for best picture.
David Oyelowo's performance as King was likewise snubbed for a best actor slot while neither Paul Webb's original screenplay nor Bradford Young's cinematography, both deemed worthy competitors by movie critics, received the Academy's acknowledgment in both their respective categories.
And many blamed Joseph A. Califano Jr.'s opinion piece in The Washington Post, which excoriated "Selma's" depiction of his former boss, Lyndon B. Johnson, as an impediment in King's campaign.
With Hollywood, one never knows.
That best picture nomination could very well become a best picture win.
