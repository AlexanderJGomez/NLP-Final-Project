Restarting the Large Hadron Collider -- the $10 billion research tool's full name -- has been "a herculean effort," CERN's director for accelerators, Steve Myers, said in a statement announcing the success.
Now that a beam is circulating, the next step is low-energy collisions, which should begin in about a week, CERN said.
Had the machine been going, there would have been no damage, but beams would have been stopped until the machine could be cooled back down to operating temperatures, she said.
"There was certainly frustration and almost sorrow when we had the accident," he said.
"It's a horribly complicated piece of equipment, it's not like there's not going to be problems along the way," he said.
The as-yet theoretical Higgs boson, also called "the God particle" in popular parlance, could emerge within two or three years, Myers said.
"When push comes to shove, the name of the game is 'what is nature,' and we're not going to know until our experimental colleagues tell us," Wise said.
