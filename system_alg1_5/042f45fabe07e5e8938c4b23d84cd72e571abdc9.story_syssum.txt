"Any future meetings between Hamas and Jordan open a new page between the two sides and serve the Palestinian cause," said Meshaal, who announced earlier this month that he would not seek another term as president of the movement's governing body.
Abdullah reaffirmed his support for a Palestinian state based on the borders drawn before the 1967 Middle East war, "with East Jerusalem as its capital," Petra reported.
Hamas personnel and their families have left Syria in recent weeks, and Ismail Haniya, the Hamas leader in Gaza, did not stop in Damascus during a recent regional trip.
But Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which controls the West Bank, spent Sunday blaming each other for the latest lack of progress.
"But, unfortunately, Israel did not accept to freeze settlement construction, which we consider as destroying confidence measures and an illegal and provocative act which led to the collapse of the talks."
