(Mental Floss) -- Investigators are trying to figure out whether the financial fraud allegedly perpetrated by Bernard L. Madoff was, in fact, the largest Ponzi scheme in history.
Ponzi pulled it off, though.
Thus, if you sent your buddy in France a letter, you could include a coupon so he could respond.
As exchange and postal rates fluctuated, though, there was an opportunity to make a profit.
Investors would pay their cash in, and sure enough, Ponzi would get them the promised return.
At his peak, Ponzi was raking in $250,000 a day, which enabled him to collect such necessities as gold-handled canes.
In fact, Ponzi didn't even need to pay off the old investors, since many of them wanted to reinvest their returns in this wonderful business.
Eventually, though, smarter financial heads started looking at Ponzi's business.
Ponzi was such a charismatic force of nature, though, that many people chose not to believe the paper's report.
Few believed that their hero, the man who had "tripled" their life savings, was anything less than 100 percent legitimate.
Of Ponzi, McMasters said, "The man is a financial idiot.
The next month, regulators raided Ponzi's office and discovered that he didn't have a huge quantity of postal reply coupons.
Eventually, though, his time on the lam ran out, and he served his whole sentence.
