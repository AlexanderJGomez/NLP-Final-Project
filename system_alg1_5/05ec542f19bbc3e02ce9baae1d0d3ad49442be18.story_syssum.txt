The red and black jacket, winged shoulders and all, that the late pop star wore during his zombie-ridden "Thriller" video fetched a $1.8 million bid at this weekend's Julien's auction in Beverly Hills, California, according to the auctioneer's website.
It includes an inscription to them on the jacket's lining, and the sleeve is signed, "Love Michael Jackson."
"Michael Jackson has an unbelievable fan base," Darren Julien, the auction house's president, told CNN earlier this month.
A signed postcard from Liverpool's finest sold for $5,504 and Paul McCartney's bass guitar fetched $14,080.
