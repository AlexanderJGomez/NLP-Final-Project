Sean and Carolyn Savage with daughter Mary Kate (now 18 months) and sons Ryan, left, and Andrew.
"The doctor told me in one sentence, 'Carolyn is pregnant, but we transferred the wrong embryos,'" he said.
"He walked in and was as white as a sheet," Carolyn said.
"I don't think I've ever cried so much in my life," said Carolyn.
"It was such a nightmare and, in a way, I felt violated."
Eventually, Carolyn became pregnant with the couple's third child, resulting in another difficult pregnancy and premature birth.
Cases like these, while tragic, are exceedingly rare, said Dr. David Adamson, a reproductive endocrinologist and past president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.
"They didn't choose this path either," Carolyn Savage said of the DNA parents, who declined to speak with media.
The Savages are not releasing the name of the clinic where they underwent the IVF procedure, but provided CNN with proof of their reproductive predicament, including results of amniocentesis, a genetic test, indicating the baby Carolyn is carrying is not  theirs.
"As the process has gone along, it has been exceptionally difficult imagining this playing out," Sean Savage said.
"I know that tug will be there every day wondering if the baby's happy, healthy and OK," said Carolyn.
