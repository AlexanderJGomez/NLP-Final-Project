Ciancia, 23, of Los Angeles, is charged with murder of a federal officer and commission of violence in an international airport.
On Friday, Ciancia burst into a roommate's room and demanded a ride to the airport immediately, said the source, who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity.
Around the same time, Ciancia was sending text messages to family members in Pennsville, New Jersey.
"At this point, we weren't connecting the dots," he said.
Ciancia was already gone.
According to the LAPD account, they arrived 52 minutes after the shooting, which began about 9:20 a.m., according to police.
"And he kept going."
"I turned around and there was a gunman," he said.
A traveler who was shot in the leg, 29-year-old Brian Ludmer of Lake Forest, Illinois, was in fair condition Sunday.
"The responsibility for protecting airport security is not a TSA function but something that I think we need to certainly examine, given what happened in Los Angeles," he said.
On Saturday, an additional 40 flights were affected, including 30 that were canceled, involving about 4,000 passengers, according to Los Angeles International Airport.
"It is most important for us as a family to express our deep and sincere sympathy to the Hernandez family," the Ciancia family said.
"We wish to convey, too, our hopes that those who were wounded during this incident will experience quick and full recoveries.
While we do not mean to minimize the grief and distress experienced by many other families, we hope that the public will understand that this is a very difficult time for our family, too," the family said.
"It's almost like an open shopping mall," he said.
