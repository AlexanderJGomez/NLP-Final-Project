It was his 15th goal in the world's biggest sporting event, breaking the German record he had held with Gerd Muller.
It was his fifth goal in World Cup finals, equaling the African record held by the great Roger Milla of Cameroon.
Muller scored 68 in just 62 games, his final goal for his country being the winner in the 1974 World Cup final against the Netherlands.
Boateng's half-brother Jerome was in the Germany side, only the second time in World Cup history this has occurred.
