The Republican from Janesville, Wisconsin, has successfully appeased House Republicans and engaged President Barack Obama in as little as 48 hours.
Then, the 2012 Republican vice presidential candidate stepped in.
The Republican's chief negotiator, House Speaker John Boehner, has been unable -- or unwilling -- to reach a deal with the President amid the shutdown.
Ryan and Obama, on the other hand, have a completely different relationship.
Even after, they remain political foes.
Southerland said, adding that "the communication between Paul and the President, I think, was an important part of the conversation."
"They respect each other," Borger said.
During the last budget battle in March, Obama invited Ryan and his Democratic counterpart on the Budget Committee, Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, to lunch.
"And by the way, in case he's going to get a Republican challenge, I didn't mean it.
Don't want to hurt you, man."
