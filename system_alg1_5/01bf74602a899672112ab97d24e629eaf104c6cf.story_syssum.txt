By looking at a total population sample in South Korea, the study authors estimate that 1 in 38 children in the country -- or 2.64% -- has some form of autism.
In this new study, researchers looked at all 55,000 school children in a large metropolitan community of Seoul, which they say is representative not only of South Korea, but also many other developed nations.
Using mathematical algorithms, researchers estimate 1 in 38 children in South Korea have an autism spectrum disorder.
The study doesn't mean that suddenly many more children have autism, Kim said.
What these estimates tell us, he said, is that "autism is more common than we think it is."
She said there are different ways to determine prevalence and that the CDC is considering a total population study of autism, but that it is not yet under way.
But Dr. Zachary Warren, who did not participate in the study, also said, "In the current study the authors sampled from a population, noted that many folks from this sample did not participate, and performed diagnostic evaluations on a relatively small number of children.
Many of the children who were identified with an autism spectrum disorder through this study were found to have a higher IQ, but had poor socialization skills, one of the hallmarks of autism.
Autism Speaks is funding similar research in India, South Africa, Mexico and Taiwan, Dawson said.
