(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia's quest for a fourth Asian Cup title, and first since 1996, is over after they slumped to a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Jordan in Doha on Thursday.
"We played very well and we created opportunities to score, especially in the second half," he told reporters.
Japan were never at their best against committed opponents, who would have qualified for the knockout stages with another victory, and a tense encounter saw both teams finish with 10 men.
Japan only need to draw with Saudi Arabia in their final match to qualify for the next stage, while whoever wins the match between Jordan and Syria will join them, although Jordan also just need a point from that fixture.
