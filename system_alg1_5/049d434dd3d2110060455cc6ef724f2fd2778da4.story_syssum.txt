Phew.
At least, in a 98-to-1 vote, they said, in public, that climate change is not a hoax.
Among them is Jim Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, who is perhaps Washington's most vocal climate denier.
"Climate is changing, and climate has always changed, and always will, there's archaeological evidence of that, there's biblical evidence of that," Inhofe said on the Senate floor, according to Bloomberg News and others.
But among the no votes was Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who said her reason for voting no simply was the word "significantly," according to The Hill.
They're the climate scientists, who have been saying for years that the climate is changing, that human emissions of greenhouse gases are the driving cause, and that we need to act urgently to cut emissions.
Congress should debate how to respond to climate change, not its very existence.
Congress could take note, and so should we.
And skip the rest.
