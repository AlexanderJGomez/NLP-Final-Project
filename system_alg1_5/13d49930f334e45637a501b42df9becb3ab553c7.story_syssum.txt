Monsanto claimed that the seeds could only be used for one growing season, meaning their offspring could not be saved and replanted without compensation.
"Bowman planted Monsanto's patented soybeans solely to make and market replicas of them thus depriving the company of the reward patent law provides for the sale of each article," said Justice Elena Kagan.
This allowed farmers to plant with reduced risk of weeds, insects, and disease.
Bowman grows corn, wheat, and soybeans on 300 acres in Sandborn, Indiana.
Mark Walters, Bowman's attorney, said farmers take all the risks when they plant, while the company can sit back and control how its products are used in perpetuity.
But Kagan, writing for her eight colleagues, was not convinced.
But it was Bowman, and not the bean, who controlled the reproduction (to the eighth generation) of Monsanto's patented invention."
The case is Bowman v. Monsanto Company (11-796).
