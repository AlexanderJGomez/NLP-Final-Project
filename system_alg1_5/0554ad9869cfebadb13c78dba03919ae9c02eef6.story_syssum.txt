Within the hour, Chamberlain, who is black, lay dying -- from two rounds fired into his upper body by a white police officer.
The petition, started by Chamberlain's son, Kenneth Jr., calls for Westchester District Attorney Janet DiFiore to charge the officers involved in the shooting with murder and civil rights violations.
Chamberlain's niece, Tonya Greenhill, who lived next door, said she heard police banging on her uncle's door that morning.
Greenhill, who has been called to testify before the grand jury, said she told police that her uncle accidentally set off his medical alert device and that they should allow his family to talk to him, to calm him down.
A video tape recorded by a surveillance camera in the hallway outside the apartment, and another recorded by a camera mounted on a Taser -- both shown to the family by the district attorney -- show that he is unarmed, Chamberlain's son said.
"The officers first used an electronic Taser, which was discharged, hit the victim, and had no effect.
"We trust that the grand jury will rightfully determine that Officer Carelli's actions, while perhaps not understandable or acceptable to the family members, attorneys and other emissaries of the Chamberlain family, were justified under our laws," Carelli's attorney Andrew C. Quinn told CNN in a written statement.
The shooting death also prompted Westchester County residents to start a "Network for Police Accountability," which calls on the police department to publicize how and when its officers may use deadly force.
