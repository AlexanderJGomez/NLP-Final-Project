Judge says Grace Mugabe, pictured with her husband, effectively took his farm by force.
In an affidavit, filed at the High Court in Harare, the judge said the "unlawful conduct" by Grace Mugabe's company, Gushungo Holdings, amounted to spoilation -- or taking of the farm by force.
Hlatshwayo said he had been operating his farm in "quiet, undisturbed, peaceful possession, occupation and production" since it was allocated to him.
The delay comes a day after the MDC accused Mugabe's ZANU-PF of backtracking on the implementation of a power-sharing deal the party signed with Tsvangirai in September.
The country is also facing its worst humanitarian crisis, with acute shortages of all essentials such as fuel, food, electricity and public-health delivery system.
