But before a bomb squad can arrive, the device goes off, killing 46-year-old Brian Wells.
But Wells' family still believes he was a blameless victim -- "innocent 100 percent," his sister, Jean Heid, told CNN.
In particular, she said, one of the plotters escaped justice.
The FBI believes a Stockton associate, William Rothstein, was the mastermind of the heist and likely made the bomb, the affidavit says.
According to an FBI agent's court affidavit, Barnes told authorities that Wells had been discussing the hold up about a month before it took place.
And he carried a cane, which turned out to be a homemade shotgun.
Because it was a bank robbery, the FBI became the lead investigative agency.
At first, the FBI saw Wells as a victim.
On September 21, Rothstein called Pennsylvania State Police to report that there was a body in his freezer -- the body of a man named James Roden, whom he said was killed because he was going to report the bomb plot to authorities, according to the FBI affidavit.
"He didn't deserve immunity, "Heid said.
And Jim Fisher, a retired FBI agent and writer, told CNN that he believes Wells was murdered as part of the plot.
"It was a first-degree murder," Fisher said.
