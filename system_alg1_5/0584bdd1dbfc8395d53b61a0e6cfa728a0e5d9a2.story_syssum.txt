Maui's culinary landscape is heavily influenced by fresh, local and 'ono (delicious) flavors.
Those and some of the founding chefs' more recent ventures -- including Ellman's newest, Honu, in Lahaina, Gannon's eponymous Gannon's and Merriman's Monkeypod Kitchen in Wailea -- are among the best places to get a sample of Maui flavor, straight from the farm to the table.
Markets are an easy way to showcase Maui's farms and ranches and the food they produce.
In Upcountry Maui on the slopes of Mount Haleakala, the Kula area takes advantage of its rich volcanic soil and cool climate, and has been central to the island's culinary resurgence.
The Maui Cattle Company produces meats from six ranch partners throughout the island, from Hana to the slopes of Haleakala.
While every day is a celebration with island cuisine options, Maui food festivals offer an opportunity to get immersed in a particular food item, like the Maui Onion Festival or the East Maui Taro Festival.
