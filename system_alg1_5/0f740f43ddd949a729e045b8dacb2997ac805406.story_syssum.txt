The new Nexus 7, made by Asus, has undergone some subtle physical changes.
The streaming-video company's new Android app will stream movies at 1080p on the Nexus 7.
The device will run Android Jelly Bean 4.3, a new version of Google's Android operating system.
A new app, called Google Play Games, is similar to Apple's Game Center.
In it, Android users can see what games their friends are playing and go up against other users, checking out their accomplishments on leader boards.
