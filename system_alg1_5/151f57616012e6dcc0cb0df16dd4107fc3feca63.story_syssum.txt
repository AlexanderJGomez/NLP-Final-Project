The University of Kentucky's solar car races along the road, on its way to the finish line.
But for some students, this summer was the culmination of years of hard work in a 2,400-mile solar car race from Plano, Texas to Calgary, Alberta.
Bochum's car took about two hours more, but the University of Waterloo Midnight Sun Solar Car Team was a very close fourth, taking about fifteen minutes longer.
"It's unique, I think, for their college to field a team, (because) they don't have an engineering school," said Dan Eberle, NASC's organizer.
"The streets were lined with people," he said.
"Reliability is one of the key things," said Steve Hechtman, Michigan's project manager and a driver.
"There's two things that really make a team," he said, discussing Continuum's crew.
"We do limit the surface area of the gallium cells," Eberle said, but added, "the people who came in first are the people with the high-performance cells."
"There's not anything that I hold against any other teams that did use gallium cells," he said.
"I really don't think that would have been a deciding factor," she said.
Its car didn't, in fact, finish the 60 laps on a closed race track in Plano, Texas necessary to qualify for the race.
"I think we did exceptionally well with what we had," Martz said.
"Everyone's sympathetic to each other and wants to see all the other teams cross the finish line," she said.
