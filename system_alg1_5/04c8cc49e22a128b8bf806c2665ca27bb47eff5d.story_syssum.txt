Ayman al-Zawahiri, al Qaeda's leader since the death of Osama bin Laden, will chide this great country again for abandoning its values and principles.
If he was known to be involved in the 9/11 attacks, why was he a guest of the Pentagon, of all places, in 2002?
Before him, al-Zawahiri was tortured in Egyptian prisons, and during his trial in 1982, he addressed a gallery of Western journalists in English and declared, "So where is democracy?
Without a doubt, al-Awlaki and al-Zawahiri were already radicalized before prison, but the tipping point toward violence came with their prison experiences.
In Egypt or Pakistan, al-Awlaki is not well-known.
Al-Awlaki could have been discredited before his prison experiences or, now, his perceived martyrdom.
Violence breeds more violence and, in this case, literally creates martyrs out of al Qaeda's murderers.
