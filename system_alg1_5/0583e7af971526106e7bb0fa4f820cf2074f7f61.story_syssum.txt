My mother, who was a big fan of the Seven Sisters colleges, had come with me.
Doc, as we all know, was 6 feet or taller.
And laughed again.
When Doc moved to Winston-Salem, North Carolina, she was not far from me in Virginia, so I got to see a lot of her.
She was a great cook, and I think of myself as a good one.
Jo is a great cook, too.
She inspected the lamb, checked the veggies, tasted everything and praised Joanne.
We both laughed.
She would always seek the good in any situation, or she avoided the question.
I will remember her as a courageous woman who always wanted to love, and wish her a rightful place in literature.
