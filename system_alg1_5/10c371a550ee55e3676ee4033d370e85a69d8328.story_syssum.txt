Zero.
Shit.
My mother, Catherine, was diagnosed when I was in high school and has been living with this disease for 13 years.
I started a wedding photography business.
After a wedding, I felt like I was hit by a bus.
On January 27, 2014, at 26 years old, I was diagnosed with ALS.
Somehow, I summed up the courage to tell my mom the same day.
It sucks, but I try to be grateful for the abilities I haven't lost yet.
My family included.
One voice can and will make a difference.
Priceless.
Let's change the course of ALS.
