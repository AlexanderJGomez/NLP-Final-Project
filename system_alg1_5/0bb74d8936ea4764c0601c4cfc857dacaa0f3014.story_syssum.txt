"It's really hard to get placed," says Candy Kwok, Angel's stay-at-home mother.
With an estimated 12,000 students across 21 pools, it's Hong Kong's largest private swimming institution.
A majority of Hong Kong's citizens can't swim, says Alex Kwok, General Secretary of the Hong Kong Kowloon Lifeguards Union.
"I feel shocked," he says, "because Hong Kong is surrounded by water and it's a big city."
"Most Chinese, especially Hong Kongers, are not as focused on swimming or sports because they think it's useless.
he adds.
"Since Angel can swim, she won't panic and can save herself.
Even if they increase (public classes by) 700% it is not enough for Hong Kong's children."
So for now, parents like Candy will go where the supply is -- at private schools -- if they can afford it.
