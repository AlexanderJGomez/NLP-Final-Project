No one lives here, a place where 78,000 people once lived.
That's what strikes you first about the exclusion zone -- what you can't see, the people.
These communities are complete ghost towns, frozen in time.
They stare at us, the visitors, and then return to grazing, as we drive off.
Tomioka, in the southern end of the exclusion zone, has a lower level of contamination than towns to the north and northwest of the plant.
On the pavement, the surface reads a radiation level of 0.042 millisieverts per hour, which is 10 times what you're exposed to in a dental x-ray.
But the rest of Tomioka sits empty, of people, of progress and an apparent future.
