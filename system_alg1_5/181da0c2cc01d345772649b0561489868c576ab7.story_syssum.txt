To entertain waiting passengers, Dalian International Airport recently recruited a squad of cheerleaders to perform kicks, jumps and splits in the airport's main hall.
Zhen did not discuss the daily schedule of cheerleader shows, but the airport has staged at least one performance every day in the past week, each lasting two to three hours, with breaks.
That's good, because we're not sure we'd pay to see them, anyway.
However, that only measures the time a plane's doors are closed, not when the aircraft actually took off.
