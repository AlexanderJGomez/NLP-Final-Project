But they agreed on the second point, saying TSA must now go through proper procedures -- though the court, significantly, did not order the agency to stop using the machines immediately.
"This is not over by any means," said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center.
But, the court noted, "many passengers ... remain unaware of this right, and some who have exercised the right have complained that the resulting pat-down was unnecessarily aggressive."
"The balance clearly favors the government here," the court said.
Rotenberg, meanwhile, called the court's decision important and said it "pins" down TSA to a policy in which body scans are optional.
