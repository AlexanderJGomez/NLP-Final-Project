Russell Armstrong's lawyer said he's "100% convinced" Armstrong's role in the reality show created his depression, but he does not blame the Bravo network for his death.
"Now, there's some sense of peace."
"He did not want the divorce at all, but he was willing to accept her decision," Richards said.
Armstrong, who was defending himself against a multimillion-dollar lawsuit, was financially drained, Richards said.
"That's what they were dealing with here," he said.
The sudden celebrity that followed the Armstrong's appearance on "Real Housewives" was overwhelming to the couple, he said.
The adults that allowed this to happen to them are responsible," the attorney said.
Our sympathy and thoughts are with the Armstrong family at this difficult time."
