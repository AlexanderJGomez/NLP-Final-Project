The explosion, reported about 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, caused sections of the roof to collapse.
"There was no warnings, no signs," Garner Mayor Ronnie Williams said.
More than 300 people were in the plant when the explosion happened, authorities said.
The search crews were moving slowly in part because the building is very unstable, officials said.
Gail Ruffin, a ConAgra worker who was in the plant when the explosion happened, told WRAL she heard a boom.
"The ceiling start coming down, and we all start running," Ruffin, who wasn't injured, told WRAL.
