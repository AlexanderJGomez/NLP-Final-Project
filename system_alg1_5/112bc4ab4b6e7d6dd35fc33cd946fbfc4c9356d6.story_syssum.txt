President Bush speaks with Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda at a Sunday news conference in Toyako, Japan.
Bush assured Japan that the issue of North Korea's past kidnappings of Japanese citizens will not be ignored by the United States.
Fukuda, who is chairing the G-8 meetings, said global warming would be high on the agenda but that he could not predict what might result from this week's talks.
"Our views are gradually converging," he said.
"What's essential in this summit for George W. Bush is to make sure the world economy does not spin downward," he said.
"One thing we need to make clear when I'm with our partners is that we're not going to become protectionists, that we believe in free trade and open markets," Bush said Wednesday.
