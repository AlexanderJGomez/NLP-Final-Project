McCartney's lawyer Fiona Shackleton, left, pictured after it is alleged Mills threw water over her.
A summary of Bennett's decision was released Monday, but Mills had sought to keep the full ruling under wraps.
Mills opposed the full ruling's publication because it contained private details about her and her 4-year-old daughter with McCartney, Beatrice.
He ruled that Mills earned far less before marriage than she claimed, and far more while married -- and at several points in his decision, he wrote that Mills' ideas about their marriage were "make-belief."
In one instance, the judge pointed out McCartney's company loaned Mills money to buy a home in Hove, England -- money that she would not have needed had she had such an amount in the bank.
"She has conducted her own case before me with a steely, yet courteous, determination."
"The wife's evidence that in some way she was the husband's 'psychologist,' even allowing for hyperbole, is typical of her make-belief," the judge wrote.
Mills and McCartney failed to agree on a divorce settlement in six days of hearings in February, leaving the judge to decide the terms.
