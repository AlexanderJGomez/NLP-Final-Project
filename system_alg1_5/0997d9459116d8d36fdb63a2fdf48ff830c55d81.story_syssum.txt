Christie, a Republican, was criticized last year for appearing with Obama after the devastating storm at the height of the 2012 election campaign and praising the Democratic president's response.
Both Obama and Christie emphasized that Asbury Park, made famous by Springsteen's roots there, and the rest of the Jersey Shore was open for business.
To drive home the point, Obama and Christie visited the Point Pleasant boardwalk and even engaged in a "Touchdown Fever" football toss, with Obama missing his throws while Christie's first effort was a winner, sailing through the tire.
Obama toured tornado-inflicted damage in Moore, Oklahoma, on Sunday and encouraged further congressional support for programs that bolster emergency management systems for municipalities.
