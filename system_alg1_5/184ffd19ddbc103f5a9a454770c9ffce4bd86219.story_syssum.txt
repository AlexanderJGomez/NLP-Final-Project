TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- Iran's supreme leader on Friday rejected opposition claims that last week's presidential elections were rigged, describing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's win as "definitive" and demanding an end to days of protests.
The legal structure in this country does not allow vote-rigging," Khamenei said, in his first address since the elections.
The Ayatollah's speech was likely to come under heavy scrutiny in Iran, amid expectations that, despite conciliatory comments, his strong endorsement of Ahmadinejad will do little to appease Moussavi's emboldened supporters.
Khamenei described the dispute over the election outcome as a disagreement within Iran's establishment, accusing "foreign enemies" and "Zionists" -- including the United States, Britain and Israel -- of fomenting violence, and criticizing international media coverage of the unrest.
They forgot about morality and law," he said.
With restrictions on reporting the unrest, much of the news, video and images emerging from Iran have come via social networking sites, often bypassing authorities' attempts to block applications such as Facebook and Twitter.
"That's the all important question.
It will be intersting to see after this call from the supreme leader, from whom all power in Iran flows."
In discussing Iran's support of human rights, Khamenei slammed U.S. policies in Afghanistan and Iraq .
"We have raised the flag of human rights through Islam," Khamenei said.
