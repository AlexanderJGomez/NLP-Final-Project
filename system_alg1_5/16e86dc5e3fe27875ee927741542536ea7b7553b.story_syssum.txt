Additional arrests are possible, Parker said.
Taylor, 24, died Tuesday, a day after he was shot during an apparent burglary at his Miami home.
At 1:45 a.m. Monday, Taylor's girlfriend, Jackie Garcia, called 911 and said someone had been shot.
There was no evidence the line had been cut, Parker said Wednesday.
Taylor was home unexpectedly because of an injury, his former attorney, Richard Sharpstein, told reporters Tuesday.
He played at the University of Miami, where he was an All-American in 2003, and was also a high school standout in the city.
