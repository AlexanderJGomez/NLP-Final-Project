"At this stage, the reason for the strike remains unclear, but we hope to gain clarity as soon as possible," said a statement from Peter Turner, a Gold Field executive vice president.
The violence in August erupted after negotiations between striking workers and Lonmin broke down and police decided to fence in the machete-armed miners with barbed wire, police said.
However, a national prosecutor has said that authorities would dismiss the provisional charges and release the miners, pending further investigation.
Clashes also erupted last week between protesters and security officers outside Gold One's Modder East gold mine in Springs, about 24 miles (39 kilometers) east of Johannesburg, police said.
The protesters had been fired for participating in an earlier illegal strike, the company said.
