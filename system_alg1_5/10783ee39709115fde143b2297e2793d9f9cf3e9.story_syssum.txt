New Orleans (CNN) -- When Kenneth Purcell emerged from his New Orleans home after Hurricane Isaac churned through the city in August, he couldn't believe what he saw.
He moved his company, iSeatz, a travel-and-entertainment booking engine, back to New Orleans in January 2008 after relocating to New York post-Katrina.
"The new people that I hired were here because they wanted to be," Purcell said.
"I've practiced in New Orleans for almost 40 years and I'm more excited about the future of the city today, than I ever have been," said Marcel Wisznia, owner of Wisznia Architecture and Development and a veteran entrepreneur.
"What Hurricane Katrina did is move a whole new generation of young people that didn't have ties to the community, that weren't complacent, that were aggressive, that were entrepreneurial, that wanted to make a difference, socially and financially," he said.
Boyd, a Louisiana native, asked city business insiders whether New Orleans could be a viable home for his company.
"And the answer was yes, absolutely.
"As companies start to scale, they need high-level management to help grow," said Tim Williamson, co-founder of the Idea Village, a nonprofit that nurtures New Orleans entrepreneurs.
On the surface, Williamson said, New Orleans would seem to be at a competitive disadvantage compared to other cities.
It's why Jennifer Medbery chose New Orleans as home to her startup.
And so as a community, business leaders here are very committed to each other's success, because it's all part of New Orleans redefining itself."
