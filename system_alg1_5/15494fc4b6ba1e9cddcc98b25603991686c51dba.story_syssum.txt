Atletico manager Diego Simeone, however, remained tight-lipped about the pair's chances of making his starting lineup in Lisbon on Saturday.
"Costa and Arda are important players but they are just names, it will either be them playing or two others who know who they are," Simeone told reporters.
"We don't know how Madrid will play, we've worked with different possibilities and we will try to block them and find a way to control the match the way we need," Simeone said.
Speaking to reporters Friday, Real boss Carlo Ancelotti said: "we will assess the injuries at training.
Real defender, Sergio Ramos, accompanied Ancelotti at Friday's press conference and spoke effusively of his manager.
"Since Carlo Ancelotti arrived he has emphasized hard work and intensity and now that is what Real Madrid are associated with," Ramos said.
