The Iowa caucuses are low-turnout, high-intensity elections.
Instead, 88% of GOP caucus voters in 2008 identified themselves as "conservative," and only 11% described their views as moderate.
Conventional wisdom states that the top three finishers in the Iowa caucuses are all winners, with a chance to win the nomination, especially if they exceed expectations.
Michele Bachmann's campaign, which once was strong enough to win a straw poll in the state, has collapsed under the weight of the candidate's considerable overreach, marked by high-level defections and rock-bottom polls.
Mitt Romney basically dissed the state for the first 10 months of 2011, still stinging from his expensive rejection in 2008.
If the deck is shuffled just right, with a number of other candidates in the mid-teens, Romney can win Iowa in this crowded conservative field.
His supporters are by far the most dedicated, if not the most numerous.
The countdown to the Iowa caucus can now be measured in hours, instead of weeks or months.
And on Tuesday night, the race for the White House will really kick off.
