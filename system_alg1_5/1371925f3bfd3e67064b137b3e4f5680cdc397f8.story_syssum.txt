Introducing MS Turanor Planet Solar -- the world's largest solar-powered boat.
Heading off from Miami in June, the boat's team of scientists examined water and air samples, as part of their research into climate change.
"The fact that the boat doesn't create any pollutants means what we measure is as natural as possible," said Beniston.
"The boat has a very special look, with her expandable deck," said d'Aboville.
"Turanor" was named after the word for "power of the sun" in J.R.R Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings" trilogy.
