I dialed the number and signed up with a private cord blood storage bank on the spot.
Each private cord blood bank charges different fees.
Otherwise, families are encouraged to donate their newborn's cord blood to a public bank (if accessible in the area) for free, much like donating blood or an organ; in other words, the donated unit is not reserved for the family who provided it.
If you do decide to store or donate your baby's cord blood, you should notify the bank or hospital by at least the 34th week of your pregnancy.
