For the moment, uncertainty rules.
Who is in charge right now really depends on where in Yemen you are, she said.
But there has already been resistance to their attempted takeover of national government institutions from different groups in Yemen, particularly in the south, where there's a long-running secessionist movement, and in the oil-rich province of Marib to the east of Sanaa.
Despite their takeover of Sanaa, it's unclear whether the Houthis really want to take charge of the country.
The government only finally got parliamentary approval in December, said U.S.-based Yemen analyst Sama'a Al-Hamdani.
And in September, Houthi fighters suddenly descended on Sanaa, where they took over government buildings, the main airport and a share of power.
This facilitated the Houthis' southward expansion, but the alliance is fragile, she said, not least because Saleh in the past waged military campaigns against the Houthis.
Besides battling the Yemeni government and Houthis, it has been involved in international terror attacks, including the failed 2009 attempt to bring down an airliner over Detroit.
As part of those efforts, the United States has several hundred American diplomats and military personnel in Yemen.
There are currently no talks with the Houthis, but there are discussions about whether to talk to them, according to U.S. officials.
Al-Hamdani, the Yemen analyst, said she didn't see an immediate need to pull U.S. personnel out of Yemen.
Since Hadi's resignation, there has been a lot of anger against the Houthis in parts of the country, said Al Rowas, the IHS Country Risk analyst.
Large-scale protests have also been seen in Aden, the main seaport in the country's south, where the current chaos plays into the hands of the secession movement.
