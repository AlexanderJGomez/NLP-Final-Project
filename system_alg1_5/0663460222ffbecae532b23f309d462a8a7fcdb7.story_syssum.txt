"Thirty-four million women demand to have female Cabinet ministers; 34 million women demand to be eligible to run for president," Zahra Rahnavard, wife of reformist candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour.
"I am here to say that men and women are equal," Rahnavard said.
"We have made this promise to the women, and we will stand by it," she said.
"For Ahmadinejad's government, women are just living things," Eshraghi said.
Mehdi Karroubi, the only cleric in the presidential race, has promised to campaign for women's rights.
"If Ahmadinejad does well in the debates, I don't think anyone will be able to defeat him," Marandi said.
"And this is why we're so happy, because we can have a first lady."
