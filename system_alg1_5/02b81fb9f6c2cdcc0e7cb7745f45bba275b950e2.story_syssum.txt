Colombian Gen. Freddy Padilla, the armed forces chief whose arrest is sought, canceled a meeting scheduled for Friday with Ecuadorian Gen. Fabian Varela.
"That's the history of Ecuador, unfortunately," said Peter Romero, ambassador to that nation from 1993 to 1996.
"It's absurd that these things happen," he said Friday.
At least 25 people were killed, most of them said to be FARC guerrillas.
After the meeting, Colombia signed a statement saying it would never attack inside Ecuador again.
Falconi quickly pointed out that the nation's judicial branch, not Correa's administration, decided to issue the warrant.
"That's not a very coordinated government," said Frechette, the former envoy to Colombia.
They have done that (promise)," Santos said.
"It's usually convenient to remind everyone that Correa is fighting for Ecuadorian sovereignty," Esteruelas said, adding that such nationalism "resonates very broadly" across the political spectrum.
"This has been developing for many years," Moeller said.
Said Spurrier, "For Colombia, Ecuador is an important market.
Also, Ecuadorian importers have to look for other sources."
"We have to close the parenthesis," he said.
