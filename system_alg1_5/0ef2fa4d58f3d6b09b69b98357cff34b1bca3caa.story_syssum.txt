"Jade Rabbit has fully resurrected and is able to receive signals, but still suffers a mechanical control abnormality," China's lunar program spokesman Pei Zhaoyu told Xinhua.
The rover stands a chance of being saved as it is still alive."
"China's first lunar rover, Yutu, could not be restored to full function on Monday as expected," the report stated.
Should Jade Rabbit make a full recovery, it would cap another success for space exploration, which has seen NASA's Opportunity Mars rover, currently exploring the red planet, far outlast its expected lifespan.
