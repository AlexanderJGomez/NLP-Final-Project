Hadiya was only 18 years old when she became interested in Hizb ut Tahrir, a radical Islamic group.
As a member of Hizb ut Tahir, Hadiya held regular talks and tried to recruit others to the group.
Hesitant to speak of her relationship with her family, Hadiya reminisces, "at the end of the day I was still a loving daughter towards them, and that's what they saw of me."
Recollecting the images of 7/7 bombings, Hadiya adds, "I think it was wake-up call for anyone in [Hizb ut Tahrir] who is living in Britain, whether they wanted to admit it or not."
Both Hadiya and her husband, Dawud, who also is a former member of Hizb ut Tahrir, now work toward building better understanding among religions and communities.
