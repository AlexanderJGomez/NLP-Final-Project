To mark the anniversary of the shooting, her memoir, "I am Malala," came out Tuesday.
Her public fight to get that education and for the right of girls to get one, too, is what put her at odds with the Pakistani Taliban.
"Taliban are not opposed to girls education, if it's within the ambit of Shariah and Islamic education, but they could not support anti-Islamic agendas and Westernized education systems," Shahid said.
Fighting the Taliban is important, but through peace, dialogue and education, she said.
Malala was left in critical condition.
After surgery, she was unresponsive for three days.
An avalanche of support poured in, including from world leaders.
This year, the Malala Fund was created to support education for girls around the world.
