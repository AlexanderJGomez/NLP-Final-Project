To start, protesters say they're looking for answers about what happened to Freddie Gray, and why.
"There is a Supreme Court case that states that if you are in a high-crime area, and you flee from the police unprovoked, the police have the legal ability to pursue you, and that's what they did," he said.
Police say they spotted Gray, gave chase, caught him, cuffed him and requested a "wagon" to transport him in less than four minutes.
Protesters want to know exactly what happened in those 30 minutes, and say it's clear police used too much force when Gray was in their custody.
Five of the six officers involved in Gray's arrest have provided statements to investigators, the Baltimore Police Department said Wednesday.
Police say doing that would violate the law.
Some protesters say the officers should be charged with murder for Gray's death.
Long before they took to the streets to demonstrate over Gray's death, some of them had already been at city hall, voicing their concerns over other cases.
They feel it's us versus them," Baltimore City Council President Jack Young said.
