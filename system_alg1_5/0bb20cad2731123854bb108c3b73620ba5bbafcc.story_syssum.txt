(CNN) -- A Texas court granted a stay of execution for convicted murderer Henry "Hank" Skinner on Monday, giving Skinner time to pursue DNA testing his lawyers say could prove his innocence.
Owen requested a 30-day reprieve from Perry's office Monday afternoon, shortly before the appeals court issued its ruling, arguing that "substantial new evidence" has come to light since his trial to support Skinner's claim of innocence.
"Since the trial, I and many of my fellow jurors have grown increasingly concerned that key pieces of DNA evidence from the crime scene remain untested," the foreman, Danny Stewart, wrote.
"All the district attorney has got to do is turn over the evidence and test it, and let the chips fall where they may," Skinner told CNN's Kate Bolduan in 2009 in an interview from death row at the Polunsky Correctional Institution in Livingston, Texas.
In May 2010, two months after halting Skinner's execution, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that Skinner has a basic civil right to press for DNA analysis.
Forensic evidence gathered at the scene, as well as witness statements, points to Skinner as the killer, they maintain.
Some DNA testing was done, which implicated Skinner, but not on the items he now wants tested.
Busby's family, including Busby's surviving daughter, believes Skinner is guilty.
