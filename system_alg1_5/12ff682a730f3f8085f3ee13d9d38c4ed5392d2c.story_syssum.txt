It's a small dot on the map between Coos Bay and Newport, but slipping by Florence, Oregon, and all this historical city offers, would be a shame.
Florence has a charming old-world downtown, the Siuslaw River curves along its edges, offering spectacular natural views, and it is located along what is arguably the most beautiful and diverse section of the Oregon Coast.
A quick right turn at the end of the bridge will spool you down into Florence's Historic Old Town District, a small but charming collection of restaurants, curio shops, coffee shops, art galleries and B&Bs.
This intimate enclave featuring a small dock, a bench, and, you guessed it, a gazebo is about as romantic a getaway as you'll find in these parts.
One of the best times to explore Florence is in May, when the city celebrates its annual Rhododendron Festival, a tradition for more than a century.
Here, toast-colored sand dunes tower some 500 feet above sea level, and, in select areas, off-highway vehicle rentals zoom around and over the dunes at dizzying speeds.
For a closer look at some of Oregon's favorite residents, tour the Sea Lion Caves, a privately owned nature preserve just a few miles north of Florence up Highway 101.
Be aware that the sea lion trademark "barking" can be loud and, while they are cute, their collective odor is less than adorable.
In the evening, as the light begins to soften, make like a local and gather a bucket, headlamp and some waders and search the soft sands of the riverbeds for mussels and clams.
Your vacation has officially begun.
