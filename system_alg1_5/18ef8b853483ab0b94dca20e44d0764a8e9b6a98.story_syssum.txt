The aircraft then climbed to 39,000 feet, just short of the Boeing 777-200ER's 41,000-foot safe operating limit, and maintained that altitude for about 20 minutes over the Malaysian Peninsula before beginning to descend, the source said.
The ELTs were at the plane's front door, its rear door, in the fuselage and in the cockpit, said the source, who was puzzled over why they appear either not to have activated or, if they did activate, why they were not picked up by the satellite.
Besides this probe, the plight has spurred an expansive, expensive search to find the aircraft.
"There's a lot of resources being expended there; it's turned up nothing," he said.
"This is a very complex operation," ocean search specialist Rob McCallum said.
Officials might consider searching along a large portion of sea highlighted by a partial digital "handshake" between the jetliner and an Inmarsat PLC satellite, said Martin Dolan, Australia's top transport official.
They have drawn up 26 questions that they want addressed by Malaysian officials, who are to meet with them next week in Beijing.
"The most difficult part of any investigation of this nature is having to deal with the families," he said.
