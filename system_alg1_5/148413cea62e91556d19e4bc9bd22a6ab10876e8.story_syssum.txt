It has become almost a clich√©, yet people, including Irish rocker Bono, continue to wield King's name when they bemoan the alleged absence of his like among the Palestinians.
It seems no matter what Palestinian activists do, they are condemned as terrorists.
These recent crackdowns make even more ironic the hope expressed by Bono last month in The New York Times "that people in places filled with rage and despair, places like the Palestinian territories, will in the days ahead find among them their Gandhi, their King, their Aung San Suu Kyi."
I believe that Bassem, like many others, was following in Gandhi's path.
In fact, this repression becomes a means not of suppressing violence, but of suppressing all resistance to injustice.
While King believed in peace, he was more importantly a person of action, and one completely intolerant of injustice.
And, when that was not enough, and his following did not disappear into the night, he was harassed and faced repeated death threats, ultimately leading to his murder.
When we celebrate the courage and vision of freedom fighters such as King or Fannie Lou Hamer and the countless others who are remembered during Black History Month, we should think of those Palestinian Kings and Fannie Lou Hamers whose nonviolent struggle for freedom, justice and equality continues.
