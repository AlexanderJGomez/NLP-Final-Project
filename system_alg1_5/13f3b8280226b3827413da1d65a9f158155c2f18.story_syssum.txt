Catherine, 30, grew up in a small village of thatched cottages in Bucklebury, around 45 miles west of London.
It was there that she met Prince William, then the 19-year-old son of Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, and Princess Diana.
In his testimony, The Sun newspaper's royal photographer Arthur Edwards described the duchess's frequent run-ins with the paparazzi.
At the time, photographer Arthur Edwards told CNN that the couple's ages and constant media attention took their toll.
Now, that's a few years off yet and I don't think she wants to put up with that for the next four or five years, every morning coming out of her house going to her office having those problems, and I think she just thinks enough's enough," he said.
In July 2007, Catherine sat in the royal box at Wembley Stadium in London for the Concert for Diana, a massive charity concert to remember Prince William's mother, Princess Diana, 10 years after her death in a car crash.
Then finally, on April 29, 2011, Catherine married Prince William in a televised ceremony at Westminster Abbey in London, becoming Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge, before an audience of millions.
The couple took legal action action the magazine, French Closer, in September, which was also fined by a French court and ordered not to distribute the edition in print or online.
Prince William and Catherine's child will be next in line to the throne after William regardless of whether it is a boy or a girl, the British Cabinet Office said Monday.
