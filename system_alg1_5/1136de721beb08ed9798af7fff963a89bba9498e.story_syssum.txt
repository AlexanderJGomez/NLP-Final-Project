If convicted on all charges, Schettino could face a sentence of about 25 years in total.
But the prosecutor voiced his opposition to the request, which means it is almost certain to be turned down.
Schettino was in court with his lawyers for Wednesday's hearing, the start of a process that will be closely watched in Italy and elsewhere.
Given the complicated nature of the case, the trial could drag on for a year or more.
The first hearing, devoted to preliminary questions, was held in a theater to accommodate the dozen of lawyers involved.
"I thought 'we'll all die,' it was all dark and cold," he said.
However, many of the civil parties and Schettino's own lawyers argue that Costa and its parent company, Carnival, should be considered as criminal defendants in the trial.
I'm very disappointed that Schettino is the only defendant," Domnica Cemortan, a Moldavian dancer who was on the bridge the night of the shipwreck and is a civil plaintiff in the case, told CNN outside the court.
Meanwhile, the Costa Concordia lies half-submerged on its side on the shore of Giglio Island, rusting and rotting in the waters off Tuscany's coast.
