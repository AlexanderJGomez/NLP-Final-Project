Coincidentally, both the donor and the recipient who died are members of the military.
Doctors knew the donor had encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, when they harvested the organs.
Dr. Matthew Kuehnert, director of the CDC's Office of Blood, Organ, and Other Tissue Safety, said the recipients' doctors were shocked to learn the donor's organs were tainted with rabies.
One reason is rabies is extremely rare, with only one to three cases a year nationwide, according to Dr. Richard Franka, the CDC's acting rabies team lead.
Only three or four facilities in the country are capable of testing for rabies in humans, Franka said, which means most hospitals would have to ship a potential donor's blood or tissue.
But she added that she does kidney transplants, and her patients can survive, at least in the short term, on dialysis.
"Statistically it's quite likely the organ could be fine, but if it's not, everybody has trouble," she told CNN.
