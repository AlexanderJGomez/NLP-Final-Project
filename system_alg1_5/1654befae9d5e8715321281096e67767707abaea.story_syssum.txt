In between acceptance speeches, the three-and-a-half hour ceremony will be filled with performances from Justin Timberlake, Rihanna, Bruno Mars and Sting, the Black Keys, Taylor Swift, Frank Ocean, the Lumineers, Fun., Mumford & Sons, Dierks Bentley and Miranda Lambert, and Jack White.
This category is tough to call because it's crowded with possibilities, from industry favorite Frank Ocean to don't-count-'em-out contenders the Lumineers and Fun.
The contenders here had some of the hottest tracks of the past year: Taylor Swift's "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together," the Black Keys' "Lonely Boy," Kelly Clarkson's "Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)," Gotye's "Somebody That I Used to Know," Fun.
If you go with what's most popular with the listeners of Spotify, Gotye's "Somebody That I Used to Know" will be crowned record of the year on Sunday.
But from the lay of the land, this is Fun.
Among critics, it's coming down to Frank Ocean, the Black Keys and Mumford, with Fun.
But with Mumford being the safer bet and a fantastic album to boot, all eyes are on them to win.
