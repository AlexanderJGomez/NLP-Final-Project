Because of the way I looked, I was often bullied by gang members verbally and at times physically, with others hitting and shoving me.
I felt different, powerless and socially isolated.
I was lost, troubled and crying my heart out but nobody heard, no one seemed to care.
My mentor taught me that if I struck back with revenge against those who harmed and threatened me, it would just worsen my situation.
Our main purpose is the exact opposite of that of the bullies and gang groups -- to care, show love and acceptance by making a small yet significant difference in school, in our family, toward our friends and the people around us, and to use our time, skills, talents, strength and energy in more productive activities.
And, even though we may feel helpless sometimes, there are a lot of things we and others can do to help stop bullying and gang violence.
Education and learning is not the sole responsibility of the school, but a concern of the family and society as well.
We want to create an environment where children can express themselves in a conduct that is loving, accepting and respecting of others, so that they may grow up to be assets and not liabilities to society.
