"The Newark Police Department was not involved in joint operations with the New York Police Department as was described in the disclosed NYPD report," Mayor Cory Booker said Wednesday, referring to a leaked internal New York police document that allegedly detailed police surveillance of Muslim-owned business and mosques across the city.
"We have to keep this country safe," the mayor told reporters, addressing questions about a separate report, also leaked to AP, that indicated the New York police were closely monitoring Muslim student associations in schools across the Northeast.
"The police department goes where there are allegations," Bloomberg said.
"In any case where you see an NYPD officer present, it's an indication that we were looking at an individual," he said.
The CIA later announced its internal watchdog found no issue or evidence of wrongdoing in the spy agency's partnership with New York police.
