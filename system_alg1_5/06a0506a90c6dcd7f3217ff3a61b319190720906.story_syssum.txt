In 1988, Nicotero co-founded KNB EFX group, a popular effects studio for film and TV, and went on to establish a reputation in Hollywood.
Long before he joined Robert Kirkman, "Walking Dead" comic book creator, and Frank Darabont, show creator, Nicotero launched his career as a student of zombie icons George A. Romero and Tom Savini.
We have the opportunity to play with the concepts, the designs, the sculptures.
There have been things they've done that I've been like, :Wow, that's really smart, I wish I'd thought of that."
I am really proud of Season Four and where the show is going.
Nicotero: No, as a matter of fact, it was quite the opposite.
You get to walk through the hallways of the prison, see Hershel's barn, all these really exciting moments.
In a few instances, like with Michonne's pets, I sent them actual prosthetic pieces used on the show so their sculptors could duplicate, as close as possible, the work we did on the show.
They're going to connect themselves to the experience, and they now know what it's like to be on the set of "The Walking Dead."
The guy, in my opinion, is a genius.
As far as I'm concerned, "The Walking Dead" wouldn't exist without George Romero.
When I saw him two weeks ago, I was still geeking out.
I love doing that.
It really is the ultimate position, creatively, for me.
