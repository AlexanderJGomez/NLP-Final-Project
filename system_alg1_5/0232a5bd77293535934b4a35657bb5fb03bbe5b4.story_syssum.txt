Claudia Aderotimi, 20, died early Tuesday, shortly after receiving buttocks enhancements in a hotel room near Philadelphia International Airport, according to police.
She was rushed to a hospital, where she later died, police said.
The preliminary cause of death has been linked to the injection, according to the affidavit.
Tan has heard reports of caulk and other products being used in the injections, as well as injection substances being purchased outside of medical supply stores, she said.
"In our cluster, these patients had to be hospitalized," she said, adding that injection procedures should be performed by licensed health providers.
