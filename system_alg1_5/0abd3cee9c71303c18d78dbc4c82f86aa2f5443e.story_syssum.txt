Yang, 22, from Beijing, China, was killed at the Au Bon Pain restaurant in the Graduate Life Center at around 7 p.m., school spokesman Larry Hincker said in a written statement.
"There was blood on him," Flinchum said.
"Based on emergency contact records maintained by the university, it is known that Zhu and Yang knew each other," Hincker said.
Authorities say on April 16, 2007, Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 students and professors before killing himself.
