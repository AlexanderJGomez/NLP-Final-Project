In the east and the north of the city, water was at waist-level in some neighborhoods.
Massive runoff was flowing south to the sea through Bangkok, as high tides pushed the water in the opposite direction.
As floodwater entered homes, some Bangkok residents still in the city made plans to leave.
"Some families in southern Bangkok had their house flooded," said the 31-year-old worker at a furniture export company, which was shut after it also was flooded.
Another Bangkok resident said she was worried about abandoning her house, which has been flooded for five days, and would not leave.
In all, 1,356 people were under observation by health officials, the minister said, according to MCOT.
It noted that most tourist destinations, such as Phuket and Chiang Mai, were unaffected.
