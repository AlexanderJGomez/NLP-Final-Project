"Greg said, 'I thought I was going to lose my mind,'" his father said.
"One of his superiors came over and had Greg apologize to the guy," said the elder Buckley.
"No, in our base," Greg replied.
"It was only two days he had left there in Afghanistan," his father told CNN.
The gunman involved in Greg's death attacked from inside his outpost and killed two other fellow Marines, his dad said.
"It's not really day-by-day," said Greg's mother, Marina Buckley.
