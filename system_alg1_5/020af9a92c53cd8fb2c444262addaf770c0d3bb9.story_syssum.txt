Mike Mertz was driving home, an hour after finishing his run as a school bus driver in Glendale, Arizona.
Whatever the reason, whatever route he wandered, it brought Mertz not to the usual entrance of his townhome complex, but the back driveway.
Corey Ash, a UPS driver, was making deliveries that Wednesday afternoon, when he heard a terrible engine noise.
Racing over, Ash could see that the driver had his eyes closed and seemed to be unconscious.
As he listened to the ambulance siren, racing up the road from Glendale Fire Station 154 barely a mile away, Ash began to pump hard on Mertz' chest.
Mertz had that going for him, but he was also fortunate to have collapsed in Glendale.
Then came another two hundred compressions, then shock, two hundred compressions, then shock.
Surprisingly, that may be the real reason he survived.
Unfortunately, such help is rare.
Now, the reluctance can be overcome.
But how?
