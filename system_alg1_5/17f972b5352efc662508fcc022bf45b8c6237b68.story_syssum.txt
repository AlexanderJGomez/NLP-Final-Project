Using powerful optics, they have found a much larger planet-like body, J1407b, with rings 200 times the size of Saturn's, U.S. and Dutch astronomers said.
If J1407b were in our solar system, it would dominate Earth's nightly sky.
With the enormous size of the rings, the eclipse the astronomers observed lasted 56 days.
Some of J1407b's 30 rings are denser, blocking more light, and some of them are less dense, letting more light through.
It is called a brown dwarf, a size classification somewhere between a planet and a star, according to the California Institute of Technology.
