He beat her up.
But Rice's case is strikingly similar to that of Mark Fuller, a sitting federal judge in Alabama.
Please help me," she said.
"He doesn't have a drug or alcohol problem and never has," Barry Ragsdale, Fuller's attorney, told al.com.
As Fuller put it, "I also look forward to ... returning to full, active status in the Middle District of Alabama."
After Ray beat his then-fiancee, Janay Palmer, unconscious in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the couple married.
Fuller is also attempting, apparently successfully, to repair the breach with his wife.
Consider that last line: "my family, where they should be resolved."
Whether the Rices and Fullers stay married is their business; but whether Ray Rice and Judge Mark Fuller committed crimes should be a question for prosecutors, and ultimately, juries to decide.
All the rest of us can do is hope that the next prominent man who beats up his wife doesn't get off as easy.
