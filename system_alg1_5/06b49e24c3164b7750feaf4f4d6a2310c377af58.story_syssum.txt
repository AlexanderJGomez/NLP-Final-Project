"Friends that were on tour with me 20 years ago, 10 years ago, are now family guys married with kids," he said.
For Slater, it's a journey that began as a child growing up in the surfing town of Cocoa Beach, in Florida.
I wanted to be a comedian," said Slater.
"Surfing is my religion, if I have one," he said.
"For me it's sort of like time slows down.
"This section came at me, and I just launched myself, kind of a 'Hail Mary,'" said Slater.
"Big waves are a whole different ball game," said Slater.
Slater has been chasing waves his whole life.
That's what we do.
He may have been playing the same ball game over more than four decades, but when it comes to surfing, Slater's love is as deep as the ocean.
