To Walsh, that is more than a number.
"Far too often, we're leaving our veterans to fight their toughest battles alone," Walsh said.
Founded in 2004, IAVA is the first and largest organization for new veterans and their families, with 270,000 members nationwide.
About 25% of IAVA's members, O'Gorman said, have experienced a delayed onset of PTSD after getting out of the service.
Right now there are more than 1,000 open jobs at the VA for mental health care jobs, including psychiatric nurses, physician assistants and psychiatrists, among others, she said.
Currently, they use different drug prescription protocols, Walsh and military experts told CNN, and that can create a difficult situation.
It's unclear how much it would cost to do everything the bill lays out, according to Andrea Helling, Walsh's spokeswoman.
Walsh is waiting for the Congressional Budget Office to provide a figure, she said.
"There are difficult decisions ahead," he said.
The nonprofit think-tank RAND Corporation estimates a third of veterans likely have TBI, PTSD or depression, which puts the overall number affected at around 600,000.
Walsh's legislation, IAVA's O'Gorman told CNN, has bipartisan support.
Walsh said lawmakers must also address suicides amongst military family members, too.
The relatives have made "enormous sacrifices," he said.
