Randy George Scott, 25, walked into the Kelowna, British Columbia, police department Tuesday evening, identified himself, and said there was a warrant for his arrest.
"You can hear him accelerating even when it says 299 kph," Saanich Police Sgt.
Saanich police said Scott, if convicted of dangerous operation of a motor vehicle, could be sentenced up to five years in jail.
Since Scott surrendered in the same province where he was wanted, the extradition process is less complex, according to Royal Canadian Mounted Police Constable Kris Clark.
