Speaking briefly backstage, Ono expressed feeling that it was wonderful for Starr to be honored, "just sad John and George aren't here," referring to her late husband John Lennon and Beatles guitarist and fellow songwriter George Harrison.
"I'll remember this one," he promised.
Others receiving Rock Hall honors included Paul Butterfield Blues Band, early soul act The 5 Royales, singer Bill Withers, punk rockers Green Day, Lou Reed, Joan Jett & the Blackhearts and Stevie Ray Vaughan.
Withers sounded great, though he may have an even brighter future in stand-up.
Not only did Ricci slay, but Morello played a nasty scabrous solo that raised the hairs on your arm, it was so alive.
