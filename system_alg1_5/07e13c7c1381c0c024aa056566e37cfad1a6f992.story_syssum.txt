"It is a sacred thing to create a face," says Wallace Chan, 58, the Chinese artisan jeweler that produced the piece.
The work, Now and Always, is a depiction of Horae, the Greek goddess of the seasons.
Rather than cutting into the surface of the jewel, shaping it into a geometric form, Chan cuts into it from the back, carving out complex images from inside the gem.
"When you work from the back of the jewel, right is left, top is bottom and deep becomes shallow.
He puts his "soul and consciousness into the creation", he says, and becomes so absorbed that he "forgets [his] own existence".
"My mind is one with the work, and my physical self is removed from the gemstone," he explains.
After being commissioned by a Taiwanese art collector to make a jeweled "stupa", or Buddhist reliquary, Chan's focus shifted from sculpture to jewelery and he began to explore innovative techniques.
"It was the only way to satisfy the standard I wanted to achieve," he says.
This year, he showed "Vividity", a brooch featuring a deep pink, 64-carat Elbaite tourmaline surrounded by rubies and colored diamonds.
"Each piece can take me thousands of hours," he says.
