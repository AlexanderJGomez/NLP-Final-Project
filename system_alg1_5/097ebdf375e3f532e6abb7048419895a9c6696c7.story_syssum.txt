Xinhua said that Zhuang, who was considered one of the best players in the world in the 1960s, had met U.S. table tennis player Glenn Cowan at a tournament in Japan.
"We were all tense," Zhuang told CNN in 2008.
"I had no idea what was going on," he said.
Zhuang later returned to Beijing, where he coached table tennis to teenagers.
According to Xinhua, Zhuang had been suffering from colon cancer since 2008 and died in a Beijing hospital on Sunday after developing liver and lung complications.
