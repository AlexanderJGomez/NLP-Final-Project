According to the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, the U.S. foreign-born population represented about 12.5 percent of the population in 2008, down from 12.6 percent in 2007.
The American Community Survey collects data from about 3 million addresses each year, and provides one of the most complete pictures of the population, according to the bureau.
Mittelstadt noted, however, that those immigrants already in the United States appear to be staying.
Along with the decline in the noncitizen population, however, there was a notable increase in the number of naturalized citizens, Grieco said.
"Naturalizations grew at a record pace between 2006 and 2008, with a total of 2.4 million immigrants becoming new citizens in the United States," according to a DHS statement.
