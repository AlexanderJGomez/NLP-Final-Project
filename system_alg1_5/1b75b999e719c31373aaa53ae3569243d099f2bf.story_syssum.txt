I see Musk, a 40-year-old entrepreneur who made his fortune by co-founding PayPal, as a "visioneer."
When he finished college, he identified three areas that could change the world.
In 1977, when California hosted its first Space Day, O'Neill's ideas were discussed by scientists, aerospace executives and politicians, including then-Gov.
Many visioneers champion free markets, less government, fewer regulations and profits for those who test the technological envelope.
Musk may be the most prominent visioneer, but he is not the only one.
For someone like Musk, the present is merely a prototype -- a provisional plan for what may become a magnificent and perhaps less limited future.
