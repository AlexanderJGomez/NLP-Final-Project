Diane Dobbs and Robert Sandefur, both 51, are in jail pending the filing of formal charges in the case, said Beth Sandusky, victim services coordinator for the state attorney's office in Franklin County, Illinois.
Last week, authorities found Ricky Chekevdia, Dobbs' grandson, at her home.
"My grandson had the run of the house," she said.
"We were on our own and we had to do what we had to do and that was make sure our grandson was safe," Dobbs said.
He's a very, very social, very polite, very talkative little boy."
Wilfong and Dobbs had accused Chekevdia of sexually abusing the boy, but authorities have said those allegations are unfounded, the Post-Dispatch said.
"I was the best father I could be given the time that I had with him," he said.
"It was just a wonderful feeling to see a little boy that's been in that situation for so long enjoy himself," he said.
