Savage and her neighbors say they had no clue that Thurmond, 36, had a wife, let alone four kids; they were also oblivious that Thurmond may have held the five hostage in the three-bedroom mobile home for three years.
He's always in the backyard, and he don't recall ever seeing nobody over here," said Savage, 29, who also has a 4-year-old daughter.
"He was nice, polite, seemed like a normal guy," she said.
"I never saw them outside, never," she said.
Lt. Missy Collins, the investigator who had Thurmond arrested Tuesday after a two-week investigation, said her husband used to work with Thurmond at a pump-manufacturing facility in nearby Toccoa.
"They said they had a mother and four kids, and apparently they'd been kept at home, and there was some abuse allegations and the dad wouldn't let them leave," Collins said.
There is no indication Thurmond had any accomplices, but he was prone to bouts of rage.
"The entire family lived in fear of this man," the investigator said.
Collins said she is not certain exactly what emboldened the family to flee the filthy trailer, but the mother told police that Thurmond had said he was leaving her for another woman.
When Collins interviewed the family, all but one of the children were pale and thin, she said.
He returned disturbed and told Medina he hadn't entered the home, she said.
Heavy, brown stains covered both toilets.
Collins said she went behind an adjacent mobile home and vomited when she and another officer first opened the door.
Medina said she has to gut the entire trailer and replace the floor, walls and ceiling before she can rent it again.
As of Thursday morning, Thurmond still didn't have an attorney and no bail hearing had been set, Collins said.
"He didn't even ask until he was behind bars."
