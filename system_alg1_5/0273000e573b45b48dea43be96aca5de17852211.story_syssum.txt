Pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong that began Monday with students boycotting classes and demanding less involvement of China's Communist Party in Hong Kong's future continued Sunday and are growing into a wider movement.
They want to speak directly to Hong Kong's leader, Chief Executive C.Y.
They confiscated his computer, two SD cards, his phone and a thumb drive, they said.
"The future of Hong Kong is ours," said 16-year-old student Phoebe Leung.
