Woodall said the decision was based on Nyang'oro's cooperation, both with the criminal investigation, which is over, and the university-sanctioned investigation being done by former federal prosecutor Ken Wainstein.
"Even though it's a noncriminal investigation, that is more important than this," Woodall said, referring to Wainstein's review.
"That's not just Julius Nyang'oro," Willingham said.
Wainstein said Nyang'oro's cooperation has been very valuable.
It's egregious.
"It's quite likely that if it is shown that this is a long-term systematic scheme on the part of the university that UNC will need to vacate wins," Gurney said.
