For a hardcore criminal, illicit wildlife trafficking is a low-risk, high-reward bonanza.
An analysis released Tuesday and commissioned by the World Wildlife Fund -- based on interviews with governments, military and civil society leaders -- underscores that illicit wildlife trafficking is not just an environmental problem, but a transnational crime issue.
For years South Africa boasted low rates of rhino poaching, with approximately 20 rhinos killed annually.
After China, the United States may be the second largest market for wildlife products in the world, a significant percentage of which is illegal, including illicit ivory trinkets being sold in Manhattan and international rhino horn trafficking rings operating out of Los Angeles.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has made this a strategic imperative for U.S. interests around the world, emphasizing it as a major national security issue, and we are beginning to engage other governments in this discussion.
Across the world, we need to strengthen criminal investigation, prosecution and sentencing on wildlife crime.
That means more money and resources for law enforcement to support, for example, specialized investigative and forensic methodologies.
There are promising signs but we will need a sustained tenfold increase in efforts from consumers, communities, the private sector, and most importantly, from governments to stop the slaughter before it's too late.
