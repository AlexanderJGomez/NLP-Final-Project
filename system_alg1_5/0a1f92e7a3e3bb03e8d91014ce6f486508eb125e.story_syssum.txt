Kryzie King, 27, was indicted in connection with the boy's death in Manhattan criminal court Wednesday.
In a statement last week, King's attorney, Bryan Konoski, said: "My client is not charged with homicide at this time and she is presumed to be innocent of allegations against her.
"We're trying to get this child buried with dignity and respect," said Tony Herbert, a spokesman for Dobson.
The child appeared malnourished, the complaint said.
No.
"In fact, she consented to have the father be Myls' custodian, as did the child's lawyer and the Administration for Children's Services."
At the New York family court hearing, it was mentioned that Ashlee Dobson was arrested after an emergency room nurse at a South Carolina hospital spotted lacerations on the boy and called the police, according to an April 8, 2011, police report from the Colleton County Sheriff's Office.
In tears, she said, "I love my son.
King, the baby-sitter, told police that on December 29 she removed a hot rack from an oven with a glove and allegedly placed it against the boy's right leg, leaving linear burn marks, the complaint said.
On January 7, during subfreezing temperatures, King told police she allegedly locked the child, wearing only a T-shirt and shorts, outside on a balcony from 20 minutes to an hour, the complaint said.
After arriving at King's home on December 17, the complaint said, Myls Dobson lost 20 to 25 pounds.
"Each one of these tragedies, it's our job to try to stop," he said.
