As a music style, heavy metal has completely passed me by.
While the thought of spending the evening head banging leaves me longing for an expensive glass of merlot, slightly fruity, and perhaps a long sit down, I can't escape the feeling that I'm somehow missing out.
Even at the end of the 80s, when Iron Maiden was releasing its "First Ten Years" compilation of greatest hits, I would have been sixteen (or thereabouts), the perfect age to fall for the charms of a long-haired, rebellious rocker in tight leather pants.
"You can wear anything you want," Malcolm assures me.
"I've got eclectic tastes," he says.
"I'm happy to listen to Frank Sinatra, listen to AC-DC, to all sorts."
And that's what metal does.
The problem with heavy metal, Malcolm says, is that the mainstream media misrepresented it for years.
"You can understand people actually seeing what was being presented to them thinking 'I don't get it and I don't want to get it,'" Malcolm says.
However, it is not about killing people.
And strangely soothing," he adds.
As Malcolm says, it's not unusual for bands to have a career that spans decades.
"Absolutely not, no, no, no," Malcolm says, looking slightly shocked.
It's not too late for me then.
