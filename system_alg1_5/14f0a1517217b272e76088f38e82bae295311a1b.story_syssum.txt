(CNN) -- Three of the best-loved leaders in the history of the Roman Catholic church will be united this weekend when Pope Francis makes his predecessors, Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II, saints in a special ceremony in St Peter's Square.
John XXIII, already 76 when he was elected pope after a long career as a priest, professor and Vatican diplomat, had been expected to serve merely as a "papa di passaggio," or interim, caretaker Pope.
When John XXIII's death was announced, the crowds wept for "Il Papa Buono" ("The Good Pope"); more than 40 years later, when John Paul II died, thousands cried "santo subito!"
For John XXIII also, the rules have been changed; he is credited with just one miracle, rather than the two which would usually be required for him to "qualify" as a saint.
Karol Wojtyla -- who was to become John Paul II, but back then was simply a young bishop -- was at those meetings.
"It's official recognition that these were good popes and we will follow their steps now," he says.
