LONDON, England (CNN) -- London commuters crammed onto buses, scrambled for taxis, cycled or simply walked on Wednesday as a strike by Tube workers shut down most of the subway network.
"The RMT leadership says we were close to a deal," Hardy said in a statement.
"If that is the case, then they should call off the strike, return to talks ... and resolve this issue without any more disruption to Londoners."
"I think we'd all like to strike for more money, but unfortunately we can't," said one woman at Oxford Circus, where the Tube is closed.
Other unions including Unite and TSSA represent the rest, she said, and were not on strike.
