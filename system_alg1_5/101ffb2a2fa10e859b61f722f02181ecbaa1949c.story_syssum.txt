Over here in China, a tourist tout is trying to sell us North Korean currency.
And, in a way, that's what it has become.
Some pay a few RMB to borrow binoculars to peer across the river, while the more adventurous take speedboats and pleasure cruises out on the river, which acts a natural barrier between the two neighbors.
North Korea, which also describes itself as a socialist state, is still sealed and secretive -- almost.
"People can eat and have clothes on their backs, but not over there, even the North Korean soldiers have nothing."
"Don't say anything sensitive around the North Korean waitresses," he whispers to us.
And you can find them all across Dandong in North Korean themed restaurants, karaoke bars, and musical review shows.
And as the four-piece all-female North Korean band plays to the Chinese tourists drinking North Korean beer, I think how perfectly it sums up this city: extremely bizarre and perhaps a little tragic.
