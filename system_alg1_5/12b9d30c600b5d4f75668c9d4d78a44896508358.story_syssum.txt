Giglio, Italy (CNN) -- Francesco Schettino, the captain of the ill-fated Costa Concordia cruise liner, wants to get back on the ship.
Defense lawyers for Schettino agreed with lawyers representing more than 200 civil parties against the captain, including Giglio Island and several passenger and environmental advocacy groups, in asking for a new examination of the ship now that it is upright.
Led by Adm. Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, the maritime experts, including professors, ship engineers and ship captains, presented their independent analysis and fielded questions from lawyers on a number of issues, including whether or not Rusli Bin's misunderstanding of Schettino's commands played any role in the accident.
"The impact would have been the same," he said.
"In that moment, I asked the helmsman to turn the ship left, and he made an error and did not, and instead turned hard to the right," Schettino told the court.
The trial is expected to last through the fall with a string of witnesses, including passengers, crew members and islanders, who say they saw the captain on shore looking for dry socks before all the passengers had been safely evacuated.
