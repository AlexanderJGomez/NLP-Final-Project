So when a report surfaced this week that North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un had been named the 2012 "Sexiest Man Alive", the self-described mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party cheered its Korean comrade on its website -- only this "news" came from satirical U.S. website, The Onion.
"Exemplary reportage, comrades."
"The world was fooled by the People's Daily, because no Chinese believes this paper," wrote @Hai_Dao_Wu_Bian.
"A lot of Chinese humor is pun-based and probably always has been," said Jaivin, who speaks Chinese fluently.
"It draws strongly on international influences, down to the images, sounds, and texts used in video mash-ups," he said.
"Extremely," quipped Jaivin.
