Obama left Indonesia hours early, because volcanic ash from Mount Merapi could have grounded Air Force One, administration officials said.
Widespread protests are expected at the summit, for which South Korea has mobilized its largest security force ever, according to the Yonhap news agency.
In his speech, Obama reflected on the four years he spent in Indonesia as a child, referring to how he and his family were warmly accepted.
"America has a stake in an Indonesia that is growing, with prosperity that is broadly shared among the Indonesian people, because a rising middle class here means new markets for our goods, just as America is a market for yours," he said.
"We see the G-20 as fundamental not just to our international economic agenda, but to our ability to have a lasting recovery at home, because fostering balance, global growth is essential to fostering growth here in the American economy," Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications said ahead of Obama's Asia trip.
"If you look at the trend lines in the 21st century, the rise of Asia, the rise of individual countries within Asia, is one of the defining stories of our time," Rhodes said.
"Further economic integration [and] trade liberalization in Asia Pacific is vital to our own interests and our ability to export more and grow our economy here at home," National Security Advisor Mike Froman said ahead of Obama's Asia trip.
