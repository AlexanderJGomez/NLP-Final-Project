I had never met him, nor was I aware that he had even heard of me.
My housemate hung up on him, believing it was a hoax, but he eventually left a number for me to contact.
We discussed the song and many others that were favorites of his and, of course, I agreed to sing at the wedding.
We were all very proud of that, so when I got the call about singing at the wedding, the first person I told was my dad.
He was relaxed and happy.
I sang some songs during the ceremony, and then a few afterwards.
What a thoughtful gesture.
They came to see me play at the Birchmere, a music hall in Alexandria, Virginia, a few times.
He spoke to the kids about his first time in Washington and how his brother John, a senator at the time, showed him around.
He was playful, too, and told them lots of silly stories about his dog.
I will miss him, too -- even his singing.
