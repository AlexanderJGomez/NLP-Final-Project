Louay Shabana, head of the agency, said more than 22,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed.
Gaza is in need of humanitarian, economic, sanitary and social help as a result of the Israeli attacks, Shabana said.
Gaza's main border crossings, which Israel often closed in response to Hamas rocket attacks, were open Monday.
"This was not a war against the Palestinians," he said.
"We asked ourselves how to accomplish this, and the answer was to hit Hamas hard -- to strike the tunnels, the terrorists themselves, and all of their assets -- in order to prevent them from committing war crimes by firing rockets that target our civilian population," the officer said.
"We want to give this cease-fire a chance, but if Hamas chooses not to, we will utilize all of our means," he said.
