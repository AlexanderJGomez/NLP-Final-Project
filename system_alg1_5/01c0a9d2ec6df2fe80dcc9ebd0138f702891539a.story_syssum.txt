Her body was discovered Sunday in Lake Charles, west of Gary, Indiana, officials said.
There, the scent went cold.
The YouTube videos showed Patrick talking, cooing and singing to someone unnamed and apparently unknown.
"If you were here, this is what would be your plate," she coos.
There's no audio on the video, and it's not clear why Patrick failed to book a room.
In court documents, Sapp said Patrick "has claimed him as her husband, had moved from California to Michigan, joined his church, had contacted his children and had been to his home.
Carl Clatterback, a private investigator hired by Patrick's family, told CNN that investigators are looking into the videos.
