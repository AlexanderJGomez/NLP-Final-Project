My first game was in 1961 when Burnley were reigning league champions.
How did you keep up to speed with all things Burnley when you were in office at No.
I said to him: "Bertie, I've got to be at this game, these talks cannot drag on and on."
It's fantastic.
It has to be Leighton James, he coincided with the period when I was really fanatical.
There are loads.
The Orient game, obviously, was the most emotional for every Burnley fan.
