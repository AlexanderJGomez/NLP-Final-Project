Los Angeles (CNN) -- Dionne Warwick, one of the most recognizable pop voices of the 1960s, filed for bankruptcy last week, citing more than $10 million in tax debt dating back to 1991.
"In light of the magnitude of her tax liabilities, Warwick has repeatedly attempted to offer repayment plans and proposals to the IRS and the California Franchise Tax Board for taxes owed," Sasaki said.
Her monthly income was listed at $20,950, although she is eligible for a pension from the SAG/AFTRA union, the filing said.
She has been touring in recent months, singing her hits for fans in Europe and South America, according to her website.
