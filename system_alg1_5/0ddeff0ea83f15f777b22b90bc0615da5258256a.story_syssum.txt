Cairo (CNN) -- Predawn gunfire and clashes from a violent military crackdown on protesters in Cairo's Tahrir Square on Saturday left Egyptians feeling shocked, confused and angered in the hours that followed.
By morning, security forces withdrew from the square, leaving behind spent bullet casings and in one place, a pool of blood.
"It was a disaster," said protester Shadi Essam.
By daybreak, the military had withdrawn from Tahrir.
The clashes came a day after large crowds of protesters amassed at Tahrir Square, many of them angry with Egypt's new military rulers.
On Friday, some soldiers joined the protests in a direct challenge to Egypt's military rulers.
Military should not run countries," said Mohamed Ibrahim Garib, who makes a living importing and exporting clothing, on Saturday.
After several minutes, the confrontation subsided.
