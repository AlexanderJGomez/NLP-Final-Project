Its official name, and the name used by most residents of the UK, is Londonderry.
This weekend, however, Derry-Londonderry plays host to an event its organizers hope can help unite this divided city, at least for a few days.
"I don't exaggerate the power of what we do," Marriage told CNN during her recent appearance at the PopTech conference, an annual gathering of artists, scientists and thought leaders in Camden, Maine.
"But the way people are moved by the work, and the way it makes them feel about their town, is something that's hard to describe.
"You can imagine sitting in front of 25 gentlemen in various uniforms and suits, and saying, 'Hey guys, it's a kind of fairy story, about an elephant and a little girl.
"So I said, 'This is happening, on these dates.
The event, "The Sultan's Elephant," was a huge success in May 2006.
"People really took it to their hearts," she said.
Thanks to a fast broadband connection, people in London could peer into the "tunnel" and see a live feed of New York City, and vice versa.
The rules: Only one person would be allowed at a time, they could take up only what they could carry, and they couldn't do anything illegal.
Some played music.
"People used it in incredibly imaginative ways," Marriage said.
We work in the streets, using the buildings of the city, the architecture of the city, as the stage."
Whether the Derry-Londonderry festival, which closes Sunday night, has a more profound, lasting impact remains to be seen.
But Marriage is optimistic.
