"How kind of you to send me a cable of sympathy from New York on our safety," Duff-Gordon writes in a letter that will go up for auction Wednesday in Boston.
Rumors that the Duff-Gordons tried to deter the crew from making other rescues were never corroborated, but Lucy Duff-Gordon later said  her husband was "brokenhearted over the negative coverage for the rest of his life," according to a release from RR Auction, the house responsible for the sale of the letter.
Other artifacts also up for auction with Duff-Gordon's letter include a teacup from the Titanic that was, according to the auction house, "destined for the bottom of the Atlantic," a guitar belonging to Johnny Ramone of the Ramones, and a three-page letter by Civil Rights activist Malcolm X written from a Norfolk prison in 1950.
The historic Berkeley music venue would become a home base for the band, which would have celebrated its 50th anniversary this summer.
