"We have received reports that Aboud Rogo Mohammed has died," said Eric Kiraithe, the Kenya Police spokesman.
But Rogo's wife, Hania Said, claimed the shooters were Kenyan police.
She said she was shot in the leg and Rogo's father was shot in the hand.
Police tried to take away Rogo's body, but a group of supporters refused and took it away to be buried in the Muslim public cemetery.
