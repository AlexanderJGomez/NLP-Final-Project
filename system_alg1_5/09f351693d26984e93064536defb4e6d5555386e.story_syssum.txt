A woman in Argentina says the pope called her Monday and told her she could receive Communion, despite being married to a divorced man, reports say.
If the pope were to counsel a Catholic in this way, it would be significant.
Conservative Catholics, many of whom have been less than thrilled with the new pope during the first year of his papacy, are not happy with the latest news.
Despite all the brouhaha, this phone conversation was actually a private one, between "Father Bergoglio"-- as the pope allegedly identified himself -- and the woman.
Even if he is the pope, such a private conversation does not automatically change centuries of church teaching, as the most recent Vatican statement points out.
Since it's the Easter season, I'll remain hopeful.
