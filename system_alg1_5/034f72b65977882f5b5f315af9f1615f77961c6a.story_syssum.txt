Earlier, a senior administration official said Monday the United States will grant access if Iran formally requests it.
"Iran's Foreign Ministry reiterated that any delay by the United States in facilitating consular contact with the Iranian national would be contrary to the logic of international law and the United States' obligations," the Foreign Ministry said.
Two State Department officials said Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, met with Mohammad Khazaee, Iran's permanent representative to the United Nations.
"There were no kinds of negotiations between the two countries, and there was not such a contact," said Alireza Miryousefi, press secretary for the Iranian Mission to the United Nations.
"They (the U.S.) want to isolate Iran," Khamenei said over chants of "Down with America" in a speech Saturday before thousands in Gilangharb, Iran.
It's uncharacteristic," Aslan said.
Iran could more easily target Saudi diplomats in the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere, Aslan said.
