Play-Doh.
Teddy has food allergies that can cause anaphylaxis, a deadly condition that can cut off his breathing.
When we are in the grocery store, we have to read every label to see if the food contains something harmful.
There's still enough wiggle room in food labeling, apparently, to not have to list what's in that -- often milk -- or what's in "natural flavoring."
Teddy ended up in a hospital emergency room with hives all over his arms, legs, tummy and back.
Once we get food into the house, we try to label it.
School is tough, too.
Same for papier-mache.
Every time other parents send food in, we have to worry about whether Teddy will be safe.
If there is no warning, the school has a bin of Teddy-safe snacks.
So I have to be careful.
This is why it's nearly impossible for us to get Teddy food at a restaurant.
This month, we will be meeting with some staff members at Teddy's new elementary school, where he'll be entering kindergarten in August.
(If milk touches Teddy, he gets hives -- he doesn't even have to ingest it.
A milk allergy can be life-threatening.)
Despite some bumps, Teddy's been able to survive our stumbles and thrive.
