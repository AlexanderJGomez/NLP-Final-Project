Dunham, who had a second heart attack in 2002, wore red Friday to spread awareness about heart disease.
The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, promoted the red clothing day to spread the message that "Heart Disease Doesn't Care What You Wear -- It's the #1 Killer of Women," according to its Web site.
Robin Savage, 42, of San Juan Capistrano, California, said her grandfather, father and mother all had heart disease.
"It's such a huge void in your life, especially when you have your own kids and you don't have your mom around to, say, ask questions," she said.
"If everyone is wearing red at the same time, somebody is going to notice," she said.
Despite the nationwide movement, Dunham said she hadn't noticed anyone else in her town of Earlimart, California, wearing red on Friday.
