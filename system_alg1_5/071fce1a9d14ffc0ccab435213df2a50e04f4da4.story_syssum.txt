The former Florida governor last month went to South Carolina, which holds the first-in-the-South primary, to speak to graduates at the University of South Carolina, but he hasn't engaged in the traditional, on-the-ground retail politicking that's expected in some of these early states.
"You got to convince these donors that you're serious, and you have to have a pre-campaign vehicle to do it," O'Connell said, referring to the leadership PAC.
The former governor, however, already has an advantage over the other candidates thanks to name recognition and ties to the Bush family donor network.
Bush's spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell, did not respond to a request for comment from CNN about his travel schedule.
