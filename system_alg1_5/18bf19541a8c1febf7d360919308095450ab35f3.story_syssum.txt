While municipal water utilities are required to provide public reports of test results, bottled-water makers are not.
(On the other hand, well water, which is found in many rural areas, isn't regulated as water provided by towns and cities is.)
"We're really pushing for a consumer's right to know what's in their water," says Nneka Leiba, an environmental health researcher at the EWG.
"Some of the brands you think wouldn't be as transparent, like Walgreens or Sam's Club, scored higher than many of the popular brands."
In recent years, some reports have suggested that tap water could be contaminated by trace amounts of pharmaceuticals or other substances.
The FDA does require bottled water companies to test for contaminants and other problems, says Joshua Sharfstein, M.D., the agency's principal deputy commissioner.
"There's clearly a difference in disclosure between municipal water and bottled water, but the FDA's laws focus on safety of food more than on disclosure of information," says Sharfstein.
The proposed Food Safety Enhancement Act covers many aspects of food safety, including better preventive control measures by food manufacturers, more frequent inspections of facilities, and greater FDA authority over food recalls.
