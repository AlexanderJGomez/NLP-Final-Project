Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Sandiaga Uno is without doubt one of Indonesia's richest men.
Struggling to provide for his family, Uno decided against the odds to set up his own business and with four staff in a tiny office, Saratoga Capital was born.
So we started getting serious looking at those opportunities," he said.
Despite all this success, Uno believes the country's wealth is not being evenly distributed.
So we as businessmen need to make sure the wealth is spread more equally," he said.
But the speed and pace is not satisfactory, I think people want to see more," he said.
"I see all these paradoxical situations.
We should do better," he said.
I think in the next four to five years Indonesia must be able to generate that expertise."
