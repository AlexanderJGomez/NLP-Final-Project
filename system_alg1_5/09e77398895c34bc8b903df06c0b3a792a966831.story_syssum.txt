Ronald L. Homer, 30, was attending Monday night's Braves game against the Phillies.
An autopsy on Homer is complete, but authorities are not releasing details, citing pending toxicology results, Tami Sedivy-Schroder, an investigator with the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office, said Tuesday.
"I'm just sick," she said.
In a statement released Tuesday, the Atlanta Braves extended condolences to Homer's family.
In July 2011, a Texas fan died after falling 20 feet at the Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, Texas, while trying to catch a ball thrown to him by outfielder Josh Hamilton.
