Despite the girl's behavior, her family said police should not have been involved.
"I don't think she misbehaved to the point where she should have been handcuffed and taken downtown to the police department,"  Johnson's aunt, Candace Ruff, told CNN affiliate WMAZ.
"They don't have no business calling the police and handcuffing my child," said Salecia's father, Earnest Johnson.
"The student was never placed in a holding cell, or jail cell, and the student's safety was the utmost importance," Swicord said.

She was later turned over to her mother, who came to the school.
