If that isn't a wave out there on the horizon, it is, at the moment anyway, a big, Republican-leaning ripple.
"Yes, the Republican brand sucks, but it is the President's image that dominates midterm elections, not that of our party."
"I am now expecting a substantial Republican Senate wave in November, with a net gain of at least seven seats," the veteran prognosticator Stuart Rothenberg wrote Monday.
"I don't see any evidence of a wave like we had in '06 or '08," says Ayres.
Again, eight weeks is a long time.
But for now, the numbers are compelling: A weak President and a worried electorate are the trademark ingredients of a wave.
