Cheney's endless media appearances, including this remarkable interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, reveal a nearly sociopathic refusal to admit any error, express any remorse, apologize for any mistake.
"Richard Clarke was the head of the counterterrorism program in the run up to 9/11," Cheney said.
From there, it was off to the races, as Cheney did and said anything to drag America into a war with Iraq.
Wrong.
Wrong.
And that's just on Iraq.
But at a deeper level, it does not matter.
Cheney, however, has no room for such candid introspection.
He said, "My misspent youth."
Still, as a longtime quail hunter, I have no doubt Cheney was in the wrong.
But here's the thing: Even after Cheney shot him in the face, there's no indication he ever apologized to Harry Whittington.
