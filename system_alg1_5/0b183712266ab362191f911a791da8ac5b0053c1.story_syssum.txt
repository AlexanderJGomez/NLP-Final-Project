The Turkish TV show "constitutes the most serious level of incitement, and it is being done with state sponsorship," Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said in a statement.
"Such a series which bears no connection whatsoever to reality, presenting IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers as murderers of innocent children, should not be broadcast even in hostile states -- and certainly not in a state that maintains full diplomatic relations with Israel," Lieberman said.
Turkish lawmaker Suat Kiniklioglu, deputy chairman of the external affairs committee for the ruling Justice and Development Party, said that it isn't "state policy for Turkish television to portray Israel badly."
"It's probably some producer who is trying to tap into popular reaction against israel, trying to make money off it," said Kiniklioglu, who has not seen the program.
Alon Liel, Israel's top diplomat in Turkey during the 1980s, said he believes the relations between the two countries are in crisis.
