It's Huawei.
At company headquarters in Shenzhen in southern China, I talked to Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei's Consumer Business Group.
"We are growing."
"Gradually, step by step, more and more people will trust Huawei," said Yu.
"Huawei is going to be able to execute on smartphones at lower costs than some of its international competitors," he said.
But that's not good enough for Huawei.
Perhaps, if that's what you're after.
And that's the question Huawei has its designs on.
