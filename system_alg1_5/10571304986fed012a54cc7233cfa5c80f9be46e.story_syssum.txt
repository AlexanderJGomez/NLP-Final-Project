Following CNN's 2012 interviews with several voice actors, John DiMaggio (best known as Bender on "Futurama" and Jake on "Adventure Time") had been finishing work on a documentary that sought to pay tribute to those unsung famous voices behind animated icons.
Strong is also known for her work on "Rugrats," "Powerpuff Girls," and "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic."
"I Know That Voice" came from that.
It is a close-knit group of people, and it's a group of actors that really look out for each other.
The nice thing about the voice acting community is there's this camaraderie, we know there's work for everyone.
DiMaggio: People are starting to recognize me at these conventions, but as soon as I walk away from the convention, people don't really know who I am, which is great because I love flying under the radar.
Some people say, "I want to get into voice acting because I have an interesting voice," but there's so much more to it than that, bringing characters to life through your acting abilities.
Sure, but in the long run, kids don't really care who's doing the voice as long as it's good.
But if you're a producer, if you want to make money, you gotta spend money, I suppose, in that vein.
It's nice to see (voiceover actors) get more recognition, that's for sure.
