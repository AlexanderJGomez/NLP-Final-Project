(CNN) -- President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt is on a mission -- to return his country to its rightful place as the "indispensable" Arab state after what he saw as the dangerous chaos of Muslim Brotherhood rule under his predecessor, Mohamed Morsy.
Egypt's central role also is dictated by geography.
But el-Sisi's government does not see itself as an "honest broker" between Israel and Hamas.
The last thing el-Sisi wants is any sort of Hamas victory, imagined or otherwise, that would appeal to the Arab street.
El-Sisi wants to see Gaza demilitarized as much as Israel does, not just because of Hamas but because of other actors there such as Islamic Jihad.
But the attacks have continued.
One talk-show host, Mazhar Shahin, declared the Egyptian people were "not ready to sacrifice even a single hair from the eyebrow" in defense of Hamas.
Even so, Egypt cannot assume that the Palestinian Authority (PA) will be pliable negotiators.
But ultimately Hamas knows -- as do the other Palestinian factions -- that Egypt's is the only game in town.
El-Sisi inherited a mess, with fuel subsidies alone costing the state nearly $20 billion a year, tourism collapsing and foreign exchange reserves dwindling.
Exactly a year ago, el-Sisi gave an interview to the Washington Post, just after ousting Morsy.
I am the most aware of the size of the problems in Egypt," he told the Post's Lally Weymouth.
