Over a period of several hours, the officials said, the Chinese vessels repeatedly came close to the Victorious in what was described as deliberate maneuvers -- once coming within 30 yards of the U.S. vessel.
That vessel did shine a light on the small Chinese vessels but took no further action, the official said.
On March 6, a Chinese frigate approached the USNS Impeccable, another U.S. ocean surveillance ship, "and proceeded to cross its bow at a range of approximately 100 yards," the Pentagon said.
The crew of the Impeccable turned its fire hoses on the Chinese boats, which also moved in front of the U.S. vessel and dropped pieces of wood in the water.
He was there to discuss the safety of U.S. and Chinese maritime operations.
