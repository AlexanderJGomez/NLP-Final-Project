Until Gloria changed the rules.
I didn't get it.
Steinem, a founding editor, examined the myth that "Women Voters Can't Be Trusted."
I was hooked.
Like Gloria, I came from a working-class family where you didn't question authority.
"Gender roles are policed," Gloria taught us.
Other times it is subtle, but it can be just as effective.
When we have children, people double down on the pressure for women to conform.
Once again, Gloria had the answer.
I am still troubled by Anne-Marie Slaughter's 2012 Atlantic Monthly essay, "Why Women Still Can't Have It All."
"A feminist is anyone who recognizes the equality and full humanity of women and men," Gloria taught us.
"Whatever the question," Gloria said recently, "women are part of the answer."
