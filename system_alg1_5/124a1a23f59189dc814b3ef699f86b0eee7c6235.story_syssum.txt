MUMBAI, India (CNN) -- The last gunmen in a standoff at the Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai were killed early Saturday, the city's police chief told CNN sister station CNN-IBN, but another official said more attackers could be inside the hotel.
Dutt also differed from Gafoor on the number of gunmen involved, saying three, not two, had been killed.
It is still unclear who is behind the attacks, but the gunmen were men in their 20s who "obviously had to be trained somewhere," a member of the Indian navy's commando unit said Friday.
"From the very brief glimpse that I got of him, he was fairly young man of south Asian appearance, and he was wearing a smile on his face as he started to spray the bullets," Karim told CNN's Wolf Blitzer.
The 160 who died included Westerners and Asians of all walks of life, including Indian police and military, five Americans and a British yacht magnate.
Americans Alan Scherr, 58, and his daughter Naomi, 13, of Virginia died at the Oberoi.
After several hours of gunfire and explosions from inside, all went quiet, and CNN's senior international correspondent Nic Robertson said it appeared that the operation was over.
Throughout the day, there were explosions, some blowing out windows at the 105-year-old landmark.
A fishing trawler, however, remains in custody.
"Until the investigation is complete, it will be difficult to say where they came from and how they came," he said.
The Chabad-Lubavitch International group said Rabbi Gavriel Noach Holtzberg, 29, made a phone call to the Israeli Consulate to report gunmen in the house.
His wife, Rivka, 28, was also killed.
