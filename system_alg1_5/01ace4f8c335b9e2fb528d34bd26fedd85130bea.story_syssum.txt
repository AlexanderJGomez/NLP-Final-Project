LONDON, England (CNN) -- A series of major international sporting events, a weak currency and its perennially sunny perch on the tip of South Africa are making Cape Town one of the hottest sailing destinations of 2009.
As the focus strengthens on these international events, the Cape Town region looks set to benefit more than many from the expected surge in tourism.
Cape Town's picturesque Victoria & Alfred Waterfront, set against the backdrop of Table Mountain, has become South Africa's most visited tourist attraction.
Still, Cape Town has the capacity to cater for foreign visitors on super-yachts and international cruise-liners.
The Indian Premier League Twenty20 cricket, which starts this month, had been tipped to go to England, but ultimately South Africa was chosen for its sunny weather.
The eight-team Confederations Cup runs from June 14-28, and will take place across four cities.
It seems for Cape Town and the whole country -- this could not be more true.
