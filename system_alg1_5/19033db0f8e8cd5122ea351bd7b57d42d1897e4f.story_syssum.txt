Speaking at the Washington, D.C., VA Medical Center on Wednesday, Gibson said actions have been taken to recover the more than $9,000 in bonuses Helman received for 2013, but he did not know if she had paid back the funds yet.
Gibson said he expects to "take action" against officials at a particular VA medical center this week after receiving more information from the VA's Office of Inspector General.
Responding to CNN's questions about when long wait times will be reduced, Gibson said his top priority is to ensure veterans receive timely, high-quality health care, but he does not know exactly when all wait lists will be reduced.
"Retaliating against whistle-blowers is against the law," he said.
