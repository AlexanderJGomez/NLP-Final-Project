But the "bad man" got on, and killed the driver, his buddy Mr. Poland.
His mother hasn't asked Ethan what happened when he was there.
"I have not talked to Ethan about it," she said in an interview aired Wednesday.
"From the very beginning, I had already forgiven Mr. Dykes even though he had my child," she said.
"I could not be angry through this.
"That's my baby.
He's my everything," she said.
"I missed you, too," he answered.
Since then, Ethan has had no problem.
The child is beaming.
"Ethan is a loving, forgiving child," Kirkland said.
