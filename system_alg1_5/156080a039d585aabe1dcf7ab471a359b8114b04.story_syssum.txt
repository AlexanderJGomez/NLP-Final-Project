At least 19 veterans have died because of delays in simple medical screenings like colonoscopies or endoscopies, at various VA hospitals or clinics, CNN has learned.
"The problem was getting worse and I was having more pain," Coates said, talking about one specific VA doctor who he saw every few months.
"I told her that something needed to be done," said Coates.
Coates waited months, even begging for an appointment to have his colonoscopy.
And the only thing she could tell me was 'I understand that, sir, but I don't have any control over that.'
And the document shows 29 vets or their families were sent the disclosures, notifying them they had serious "adverse events" because of delayed care.
In the Florida region, five veterans are dead, and 14 vets or their families were sent the disclosures, notified that they suffered "adverse events" because of delayed or denied care or diagnosis, according to the exclusive document.
"I don't know what my outcome is going to be," said Coates.
"The fact that we've had veterans who have died in the very facilities that are supposed to be taking care of them, and not by natural means, by means that could have been prevented is egregious," said Miller, R-Florida.
Miller said the VA, from the top down, has consistently ignored his committee's requests to find out who is responsible.
"That's why we asked the question again today, with members of the South Carolina delegation and Georgia delegation, tell us exactly who was disciplined and how.
The requests have all been denied, or ignored.
He also stated: "As a result of the consult delay issue VA discovered at two of our medical centers, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) conducted a national review of consults across the system.
When a veteran is denied care, we are all dishonored."
"Someone needs to stand and face the person who suffered and the veterans who have died and say, 'Hey it was me, I let the ball drop,' " he said.
