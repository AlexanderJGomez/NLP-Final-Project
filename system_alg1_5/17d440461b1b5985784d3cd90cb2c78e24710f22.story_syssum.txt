Experts are not just individuals.
For now, Google is screening people and companies that want to offer their services through Helpouts.
People can have a counseling session, consult with a dietitian or get advice from a registered lactation support consultant over the video chats.
In addition to the website, there is an Helpouts Android app.
Payment is handled by Google Wallet, and all the prices are set by the experts offing the Helpouts.
