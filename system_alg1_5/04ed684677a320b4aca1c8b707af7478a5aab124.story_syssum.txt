But events in Japan, where two of the six spent fuel pools at the Fukushima Daiichi facility were compromised, have raised questions about practices at the nation's 104 nuclear reactors, which rely on a combination of pools and dry casks to store used fuel.
Currently, there is no maximum time fuel can remain in spent fuel pools, the NRC said Wednesday.
"Spent fuel pools are considered 'safety significant' systems, so they meet a lot of the same standards that the reactor itself would have to meet," said Greg Jaczko, chairman of the NRC.
"At many sites there is nearly 10 times as much irradiated fuel in spent fuel pools as in the reactor core," he said.
"We don't have a maximum time (fuel can stay in the pools)," he said.
A high-ranking energy department official, meanwhile, said a commission studying the issue of spent fuel will issue an interim report by July 29.
