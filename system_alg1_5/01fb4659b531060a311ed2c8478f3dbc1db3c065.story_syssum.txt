(AOL Autos)  -- At the 2009 Detroit Auto Show, Chrysler, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota and MINI showed the world what electric vehicles of the future will look like.
Three of the four electric vehicles Chrysler showed in Detroit, Michigan, were shown at other events and even to Washington bureaucrats.
To date, the ENVI group has developed four electrically powered models, each quite different from the other: a Dodge Circuit EV sports car (rear-wheel drive), a Chrysler Town & Country minivan (front-wheel-drive), a Jeep Wrangler Unlimited (all-wheel-drive), and now a Jeep Patriot (front-wheel-drive).
Every one of their vehicles uses similar electric drive motors (only varying in power output), advanced lithium-ion batteries, and a power management controller.
The Dodge Circuit carries a larger battery pack and no generator, so its range on the charge it carries is approximately 150-200 miles.
The Mercedes approach was to develop one efficient body style, and then equip it with three different electric drive packages.
The E-Cell Plus, with a range of approximately 360 miles, is the distance champion.
For the record, when you see photos of these cars together, the E-Cell is lime green, the F-Cell is mint green, and the E-Cell Plus is orange.
Important to this story, Toyota also committed to selling a battery powered electric car in 2012 for the U.S. market.
As Toyota releases more details, we'll bring them to you.
Performance from the 204-horsepower motor equals the gas-powered MINI, with a 0-60 mph run in 8.5 seconds.
After the leases expire, BMW will ship the MINIs back to Germany for evaluation.
