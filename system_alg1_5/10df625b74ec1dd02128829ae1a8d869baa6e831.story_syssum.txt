The shooter, Charles "Zeke" Sponaugle Sr., had been living at the property recently, Geller said.
Two people were killed and four were wounded, said Sgt.
"Based on evidence at the scene, as soon as deputies arrived they were in an active shooting situation," Geller said.
"Since 2000, deputies have been to this property 23 times," Lowe said.
