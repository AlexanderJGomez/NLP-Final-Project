As of Monday, the boy was still in Las Vegas, where his status will be discussed in court Tuesday, a spokesman for Minnesota's Hennepin County said.
Patrick Hogan, a spokesman for Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, said the crew "became suspicious of the child's circumstances" during the flight.
He was there the day before, the station reported, citing airport officials.
The incident is a first for the Minneapolis airport, according to Hogan.
However, he had a boarding pass.
But any Colosseum dreams were dashed.
