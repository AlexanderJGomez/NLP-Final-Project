At the same time, a new report about the Syrian civil war showed what appears to be convincing evidence of large-scale "systematic torture and killing" by the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Iran's top ally.
Under the deal negotiated in November, Iran suspended some of its nuclear enrichment operations, and Western governments started lifting some of the economic sanctions they have used to pressure Tehran.
At the urging of its Iranian patrons, Lebanon's Shiite militia, Hezbollah, moved its forces across the border into Syria, helping to turn the tide of the war and adding to its increasing radicalization.
Iran has not only saved al-Assad, it has changed the character of the fight.
In the eyes of Arab states, the U.S. was taking the first steps towards capitulating before Iran's aspirations.
But nobody thinks the deal, as it stands now, is a solution.
In the meantime, Iran's economy has already started recovering.
European, Asian and Arab businessmen are lining up to make deals with a resurgent Iran.
A stronger Iran would deepen the divisions separating Sunnis and Shiites, Arabs and Persians, Saudis and Iranians, Palestinians and Israelis, making them all but impossible to bridge.
Otherwise, the region will become an even more dangerous and desperate place, as we see today in Syria.
