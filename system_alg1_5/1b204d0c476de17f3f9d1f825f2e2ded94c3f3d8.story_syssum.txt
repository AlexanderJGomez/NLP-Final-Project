As Nel turned once again to the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, he repeatedly challenged Pistorius over his actions in the moments leading up to Steenkamp's death.
My firearm was pointed at the door because that's where I believed that somebody was," he said.
"You knew Reeva was behind the door, and you shot at her," Nel said more than once.
"That's not true," Pistorius replied in a low tone.
"You wanted to shoot," contended Nel, who on Thursday sought to build a picture of Pistorius as an arrogant hothead who is reckless with guns.
Nel also argued that it was "not possible" that Steenkamp would not have responded when Pistorius screamed to her about what he thought was an intruder in the house, as he has said happened.
Pistorius said he did not.
Pistorius replied that he didn't because he was sure about what he had heard.
... My whole body was fixated on the threat," Pistorius answered.
Pistorius became emotional as the cross-examination continued, prompting Nel to ask him why.
Pistorius, becoming emotional, replied, "I don't need time.
A little later, Nel made a mistake while questioning Pistorius, who pointed it out.
A day earlier, the athlete denied that he acted selfishly toward Steenkamp.
"Because it was all about Mr. Pistorius," Nel said.
The trial has gripped South Africa, where Pistorius is considered a symbol of triumph over physical adversity.
South Africa does not have jury trials.
