Another 100 or so have been injured, authorities have said.
"For the time being, there is no evidence suggesting that al Qaeda was involved," Interior Minister Muammer Guler told Turkey's state news agency, Anatolia.
Of the 50 people who remained hospitalized late Saturday, 29 were in critical condition, Guler said.
One Reyhanli resident, Abu Marwan, said Saturday that people began grabbing sticks and "going after Syrians" in the aftermath of the bombings.
"We almost have more Syrians here than Turks, and people are getting angry," he said.
"The windows, the cars, everything is burned around it, people are burned.
The Local Coordination Committees for Syria, an opposition group, has reported that Syrian government forces had fired several shells in the direction of Reyhanli, which is in Turkey's southern province of Hatay.
The conflict in Syria has repeatedly spilled across the border to Turkey, prompting Turkish security forces to reinforce the frontier.
