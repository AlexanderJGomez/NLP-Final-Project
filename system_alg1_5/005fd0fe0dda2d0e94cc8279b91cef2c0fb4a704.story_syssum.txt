Diane Sims, who said she loves her brother, said she supports a proposal that would expand his visits to their mother's home in Williamsburg, Virginia, and might eventually allow him to live there as a full-time outpatient.
"That's a concern to me," Sims said quietly.
Hinckley was staying at the home of his sister and her husband in Dallas on October 13, 1980, when, according to testimony in his 1982 trial, he went to a pawn shop to buy two .22-caliber revolvers, one of which he used to shoot Reagan and the others five months later.
Since his conviction, Hinckley has been living in St. Elizabeths, a government mental hospital in Washington.
Currently, he spends 10 days a month in Williamsburg.
Sims often spends time in Williamsburg when Hinckley is there and drives him back to St. Elizabeths.
Hinckley later ended the engagement, doctors have said.
Sims said that is the case.
The group was surprised to see Hinckley there, she said.
"In general, the people in town have been very tolerant," she said.
Hinckley's sister said she had accompanied him to bookstores and never saw him look at any books like that.
But in response to questioning by a prosecutor, she said she wasn't aware Hinckley had failed to go to the movies as planned on two occasions, in July and in September.
According to Sims, about midway through the trip to Washington, Hinckley's brother, Scott, got a call on his cell phone from an agent who said he had been late.
