And Everton's victory was no piece of luck.
Whilst Everton seemed to be tiring, they still held their own when Manchester United attacks came.
But after that, Everton sat back and frustrated Manchester United's attempts to try and get chances to the new signing.
Colombian midfielder Abel Aguilar, who normally plays for Hercules, struck in the 53rd minute of the game and the second came two minutes into time added on from Portugal striker Nelson Oliveira, who is on loan from Benfica.
Bayern then hit Regensburg with the final two goals 10 minutes before time when Croatia striker Mandzukic got his second and the man who replaced him, veteran Peru international Claudio Pizarro, scored number four in the 88th minute to mark the start of his second spell in Munich.
