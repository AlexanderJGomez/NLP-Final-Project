The eerie find was made after the owner of the site of the former Minus Funeral Home in Dover contacted authorities about 38 small containers left behind on the property, authorities said.
Nine of the marked containers held the remains of Jonestown massacre victims, Chandler said.
There was no evidence of criminality in the remains' disposal, Chandler said.
On November 18, 1978, Jones' idealistic dream of creating a socialist paradise turned deadly when his followers were ordered or forced to drink cyanide-laced punch.
But Jones sent gunmen to a nearby airstrip, where they killed Ryan, an NBC correspondent and his cameraman, a newspaper photographer and one of the departing family members.
A few escaped into the jungle.
It is not known who shot him or whether he shot himself.
