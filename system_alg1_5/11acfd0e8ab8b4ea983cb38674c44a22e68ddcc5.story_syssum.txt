There was something about seeing these behemoths stomp Tokyo to dust that made me absolutely giddy: the primal doomsday terror of a beast created by A-bomb radiation, the model-shop ingenuity, the laughable man-in-a-rubber-suit campiness.

Taking a cue from "Jaws," he wisely delays Godzilla's appearance, building suspense.
The MUTOs, who arrive on the scene after leveling a Japanese nuclear reactor, care about two things: feeding on the radiation that created them and mating with each other in...San Francisco of all places.
Godzilla is humanity's only hope for destroying the MUTOs.
In its handful of moments like these, "Godzilla" almost makes you feel like a kid again.
