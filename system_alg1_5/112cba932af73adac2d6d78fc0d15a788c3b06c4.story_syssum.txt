Canada has decided to shut down its side of the Whitetail, Montana, border crossing next year because fewer than five vehicles a day use the crossing.
The Department of Homeland Security has stressed the need for spending tens of millions of dollars in Montana to improve security along the border.
Even Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat who last year was one of the biggest supporters of the plan to spend millions on Montana's border crossings, is now backtracking.
Last year after CNN aired a report showing how little the state's border stations were used, the Department of Homeland Security announced it would review its plans.
It is not clear if anyone at Homeland Security discussed Canada's plans as part of that review.
