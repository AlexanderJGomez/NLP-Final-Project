Matt Breen, editor-in-chief of The Advocate and one of the most impassioned, trustworthy voices out there when it comes to politics and civil liberties, started a petition.
Benedict Cumberbatch, who so exquisitely plays Turing in the movie, said it best perhaps: "Alan Turing was not only prosecuted, but quite arguably persuaded to end his own life early, by a society who called him a criminal for simply seeking out the love he deserved, as all human beings do.
Indeed, part of what makes telling Turing's story so important is that thousands like him experienced the same cruelty as he did, enduring relentless discrimination simply for attempting to live complete, fulfilled lives.
The heroes of our movement, alive or dead, are there to remind us of what we still need to strive towards.
"The Imitation Game" and efforts inspired by it, like Matt's petition, guarantee that Turing and men like him won't ever be forgotten.
