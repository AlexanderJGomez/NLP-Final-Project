The suspect said there was "a bomb on board," Turkish officials said, and he tried to divert the plane to Sochi, Russia -- the site of the Winter Olympics.
The pilots tricked him by turning the plane twice, and the suspect calmed down once he thought his demand was being met, Lenko said.
"He thought for a while he was going to Sochi, but after a while he realized he was in Istanbul," he said.
Ukrainian Embassy officials in Istanbul were expected to meet the suspect who was taken into custody by Turkish authorities after the plane safely landed in Istanbul, Lenko said.
