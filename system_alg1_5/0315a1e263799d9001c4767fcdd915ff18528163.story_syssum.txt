You just do it.
Not so, my friend.
As a woman, I know this to be very true.
A man who is calm, cool, collected, comfortable and confident will trump an Abercrombie model every time.
Women do not sit around with their girlfriends and say "Oh, Marni, I can't wait to meet a lazy, unreliable jerk who treats me poorly and feeds on my insecurities."
Women want to be approached, as long as it's by the right person.
Until you get to know this girl, it's about you, not her.
Respect yourself first, and women will follow.
Sitting on your couch watching "Law & Order" is not going to bring you results with women.
