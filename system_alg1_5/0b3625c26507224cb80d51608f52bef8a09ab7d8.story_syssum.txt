LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Perhaps Ryan Seacrest said it best at the top of the "American Idol" Tuesday night when describing Adam Lambert and Kris Allen, the show's final two contestants.
"I think 'Mad World' is kind of symbolic," Lambert told reporters after the show.
"I thought it was too laid back for a night like this," said Cowell.
Cowell told the 27-year-old afterward that "you have been one of the best, most original contestants we've ever had on the show."
"There was a lot of lyric, and it was a big song," said Lambert.
"He's always giving me stuff to change about mine ... to make it better," Allen told reporters.
Allen and Lambert will return to the stage Wednesday night and find out, along with the rest of the world, who will be crowned the next "American Idol" at the two-hour finale.
