To this day, I can remember at the age of 8 dropping the needle on the disc and hearing Lennon's voice roar through the 10-inch speaker on my record player.
Just a couple of weeks earlier, we had reported on Lennon's comeback with the album "Double Fantasy," which marked his re-emergence after five years out of the music business as a self-proclaimed "househusband."
It was my executive producer, John Martin.
We gathered that night in our offices to sift through the material that we had: old Beatles footage, a Lennon documentary that my producer shot years earlier, and the famous D.A.
We collected the names of friends, collaborators and other acquaintances who could help us tell the Lennon story.
This weekend, CNN will examine the events leading up to Lennon's killing.
Ono told Rolling Stone she believes this rekindling of interest in Lennon "has to do with the social climate, with wanting some of John's energy, power and conviction."
Marc Roberge, the lead singer of alt-rockers O.A.R., was not even 2 years old when Lennon was killed.
Like Roberge, I've often wondered what would have happened had Lennon not been murdered.
