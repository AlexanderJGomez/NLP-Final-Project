Barnes, 37, was arrested Wednesday after police tracked him down using his car's GPS device.
Like in Philadelphia, the abduction in Virginia was brazen.
In both cases, their attacker held them for a few days.
She was taken to the home of the suspect's parents in Charles City County, where she was sexually abused, authorities said.
Two miles away, she stumbled onto a business, and employees brought her inside.
After all that her daughter suffered, the mother said, she changed and didn't look like herself.
During the struggle, her glasses and cell phone fell to the road.
"If it wasn't for him, I don't think we would have had the same outcome," Sloan said.
"I'm glad they got him," his former father-in-law, Anthony Meyers, told CNN affiliate, KTRK.
A day after the kidnapping, the suspect allegedly used her ATM card at a machine in Aberdeen, Maryland.
"She had injuries, but nothing life-threatening, fortunately," Ramsey said.
