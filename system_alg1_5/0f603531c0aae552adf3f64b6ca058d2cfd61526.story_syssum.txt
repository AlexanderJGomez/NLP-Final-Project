Regardless of the global profile and recognition, writing for Soyinka has always been, and always will be, a part of his life.
I was already writing short stories for the radio, and selling poems to poetry and art festivals, I was involved in school plays, I wrote essays, so there was no definite moment when I said, now I'm a writer.
"When I write plays, I'm already seeing the shapes on stage, of the actors and their interaction, and so on and so forth.
Soyinka spends his time between Nigeria, Europe and the U.S., much of it on the lecture circuit, but the need to write remains.
And once I've done that, no matter where, I'm satisfied."
