Eileen Brennan, who earned an Oscar nomination for her hilarious turn as the exasperated drill captain in 1980's "Private Benjamin," has died, CNN has confirmed.
Brennan was known for character roles as sassy, brassy women, the kind with a sandpaper surface but a light, pure heart.
Other TV appearances included guest shots on "Taxi," "thirtysomething," "ER," "Murder, She Wrote," "Mad About You," "Touched by an Angel" and six episodes of "Will & Grace."
"It was my only hope," Brennan told People magazine in 1985.
"Everyone hits bottom their own way," she said.
It just knocks me out to say that, but I mean it."
