Policy-makers in the UK have stepped in to protect bat populations, criminalizing any interference with their roosts, even if no bats are currently present.
"If you have bats roosting in your building, you can't disturb them in any way without getting a special license," says Kelly Gunnell, Built Environment Officer with the Bat Conservation Trust, a charitable organization in London, England.
"Only about half the bats here regularly use buildings as roosts, although nearly all of them will use them at some stage," says Gunnell.
English bats are tiny, with the smallest species, the pipistrelle, able to fit into a matchbox.
"It's very preliminary, but there seems to be evidence that when you put solar panels on your roof, it can increase the internal roof void temperature, which can be disturbing to bats," says Gunnell.
While demolishing a 100-year-old brick farmhouse in Suffolk, England, a maternity roost for brown long-eared bats was found in the attic.
"Or, if they do, it can take them up to five years."
That's quite a nicely designed bat house, but two years on, it's never been used by bats.
