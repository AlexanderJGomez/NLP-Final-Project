"If the Globe Theatre goes to North Korea, they should read up on the reality of the country before they get there," said Niall Couper, a spokesperson for Amnesty International.
"No tragic play could come close to the misery that the 100,000 people trapped in the country's prison camps endure -- where torture, rape, starvation and execution are everyday occurrences," Couper said.
"Like all the best works of art, 'Hamlet' instigates discussion and dialogue, and like any theatre, we wish to play to, and interact with, as many people as we possibly can, in as diverse a range of locations as possible.
"There's a dark irony in the fact that Hamlet focuses on a prince wrestling with his conscience," Couper said.
Sadly he shows no sign of wrestling with his conscience."
