(CNN) -- Fifty years after President John F. Kennedy's assassination, there are very few down-the-line defenders of the Warren Commission to be found.
-- Far worse was the behavior of the CIA, which coached some witnesses, hid others and withheld important information.
It was a chance to come clean, with lesser consequences, and the CIA didn't take it.
"The evidence does not establish a significant link," the commission asserted, but in fact, Ruby was in frequent contact with mobsters.
I interviewed some of them, still living after the passage of five decades, and to this day they cannot understand why the commission was uninterested.
So, it may come as a surprise that, despite everything, a large part of the commission's basic conclusion turns out to be correct.
The Dallas police found photos of Oswald holding a rifle, taken by his wife.
Oswald's rifle was found, and his palm print was identified on a box inside the sniper's nest on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository.
A homemade paper bag was left on the sixth floor, and the employee who gave Oswald a ride to the depository on the morning of November 22 testified that Oswald was carrying a parcel wrapped in brown paper that Oswald claimed was "curtain rods," but which just as easily could have been a disassembled rifle.
Oswald tried to shoot another officer at the Texas Theatre when he was captured a little while later, shouting, "It's all over now."
There is no question that many powerful individuals and groups, some with whom Oswald had personal association, possessed the means, motive and opportunity to kill President Kennedy.
After 50 years, it is absurd that anything is still hidden.
Supposedly, the documents will be made public in a few years, but there is no guarantee.
Transparency cannot bring President Kennedy back, but at long last it can help America to come to terms fully with November 22, 1963 -- and perhaps to prevent similar events in our future.
