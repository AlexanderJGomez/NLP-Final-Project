Just west of Misrata, in Dafniya, 14 rebel fighters were killed and 42 were wounded Wednesday during a firefight with Gadhafi forces, said Ibrahim.
On the western front, journalist David Adams said rebels were using Grad launchers, two Russian tanks and a number of other vehicles, rockets and guns.
Rebels, whose casualties included at least seven dead and 15 wounded, said their next target would be Al Assabiah, said Adams.
The rebels said they were moving northward, closer to the capital on the Mediterranean Sea.
France has acknowledged arming the rebels, saying the weapons were for self-defense.
In a contentious closed-door U.N. Security Council meeting Tuesday, Russia argued that, by sending weapons, France had violated the council's resolution that authorized the use of NATO force in Libya.
