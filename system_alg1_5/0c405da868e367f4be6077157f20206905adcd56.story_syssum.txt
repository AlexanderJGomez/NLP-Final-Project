But, of course, this is not all of us.
My son, still inside her, was slipping away from us.
"Let's end this," I said.
Thankfully, my son heard our voices, the same voices he had been hearing since he was able to hear while inside the womb.
Oh, there they are.
I am black, and she is Indian-American.
To do this, we had to be prepared.
But in truth, no one is ever "ready."
Second, my son is good.
Third, my son was born intelligent, as a whole human being, with the ability to express and understand human emotion.
Fourth, my son has rights and responsibilities.
Right now, my son is sleeping.
And we will do the best we know how, praying all along that it is enough.
