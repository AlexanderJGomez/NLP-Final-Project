While Chen's plight and dramatic escape have made top headlines around the world, news outlets in China, all of which are state-controlled, have mostly ignored the story.
One of the two, a young man who declined to give his name, said: "It was all over Weibo for a while before the topic was censored."
The obvious ones, like his initials "CGC" or "blind man," were caught by censors quickly and added to the search blacklist.
Other newly banned keywords include Chen's home village "Dongshigu," "U.S. embassy" and "pearl" -- nickname of Chen's friend He Peirong, who drove him to Beijing and was taken into custody after the news broke.
One of the tags for the video was "Chen Guangcheng."
By Monday afternoon, "StevenCNN" -- my Weibo name -- has become a banned search term.
