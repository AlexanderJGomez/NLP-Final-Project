An infant too young to have received the immunization may have transmitted measles to the initial Emeril's staff member, the health district said.
Measles starts with a fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes and sore throat, the CDC said.
People who dined at the restaurant on those days, as well as people who dined after 4 p.m. on February 4-7, should review their immunization status and contact their doctors if they are not fully immunized or haven't already had measles, the health district said.
The health district said a person with one of the newly identified cases visited two other Las Vegas businesses, a Walgreens and a Chili's Grill & Bar, on February 22.
