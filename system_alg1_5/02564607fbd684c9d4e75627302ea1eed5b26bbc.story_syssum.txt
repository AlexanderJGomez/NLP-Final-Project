All of it."
On Tuesday, Taliban militants stopped a van carrying three girls, including Malala, on their way home from school in northwestern Pakistan's conservative Swat Valley.
For Malala, it was touch-and-go for a while.
"I have the right of education," Malala said in a 2011 interview with CNN.
I have the right to speak up."
"When your people need you, you should come up," she told CNN's Reza Sayah.
"In attacking Malala, the terrorists have failed to grasp that she is not only an individual, but an icon of courage and hope," the general said.
"If the Taliban wants to fight, then they should pick on someone their own size," a girl said on a local news channel.
"The secretary-general, like many around the world, has been deeply moved by Malala Yousufzai's courageous efforts to promote the fundamental right to education -- enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights," a representative for Ban said.
Twitter, the closest thing to a barometer of public opinion, likewise lit up.
The valley, near the Afghanistan border and about 186 miles (300 kilometers) from the capital city of Islamabad, boasted the country's only ski resort.
"I was scared of being beheaded by the Taliban because of my passion for education," she told CNN at the time.
"During their rule, the Taliban used to march into our houses to check whether we were studying or watching television."
That's untrue, she said.
If the government doesn't talk about this latest issue and have justice served, it will be a "step back," she said.
