That's a big mistake.
This year, the stakes are big.
While Republicans will certainly retain control of the House, it is unclear whether Democrats will continue to control a majority of the Senate.
With control of the majority, Senate Democrats still have the power that social scientists call "agenda setting."
A Senate majority is also key to the future of the courts.
If Republicans gain control of the Senate, the White House will be in big trouble with its appointments.
If Democrats retain control of the Senate, it would have a very different effect.
Americans should not be complacent.
