You may have seen coverage of new discoveries about exoplanets, star formation, dwarf galaxies, cosmology and more.
Astronomical Society meetings are terrific for learning about the latest research, networking with colleagues, recruiting graduate students or forming new research collaborations.
Hundreds of thousands of scientists work in the federal government.
After all, budgets are tight and travel costs money.
Science is no different.
But every so often, you have to have a real conversation.
Science careers are attractive in many ways, but across the country, sequestration is devastating budgets for research.
Astronomy research experiences for undergraduates -- funded by the National Science Foundation, among others -- are an effective way to retain students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math, or STEM, majors.
My own research students study supermassive black holes billions of light years from Earth -- not exactly an issue in daily life, it's true, but while some of those students have pursued careers as astronomers, many have gone into other areas, including theoretical physics, high school science teaching, oceanography, energy, veterinary school, the financial industry and computing, contributing in important ways to the STEM enterprise.
