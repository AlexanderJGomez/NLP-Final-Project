Now that Republicans have control of both houses of Congress, they are going to have to do better -- and do right by all Americans, not just their fringe conservative base.
Then, as now, Americans say the economy is the most important problem facing the country.
Meanwhile, Republicans have touted a list of "more than 30 jobs bills" they have passed in the House but have failed in the Democratic Senate.
The American people have entrusted Republicans with control of Congress.
Leading, in this context, means passing laws that solve real problems and are in forms that both parties agree on.
Of course, no party should govern based solely on popular referendum.
That would be stupid.
But when asked, they place more blame with Republicans.
And if Republicans don't start learning how to lead in a responsible, bipartisan fashion, the American people will have no more patience.
