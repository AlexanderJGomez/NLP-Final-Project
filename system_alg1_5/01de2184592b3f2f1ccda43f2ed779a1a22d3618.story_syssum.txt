"In the first three months, I saw such a fast improvement, now I'm worried about plateauing," said Jason Dinant.
Dinant, a Las Vegas, Nevada, resident, is one of the three iReport contributors being followed by CNNhealth as they strive to meet diet and fitness goals they set at the beginning of the year.
Dinant was invited because,  the Naked Boy News is "a very popular act," said Maurice Michaane, director of the event.
To avoid looking like "a toothpick with abs," he started lifting weights.
"You can't see a six-pack through fat," Dinant said.
"It's hard to eat that much protein," Dinant said.
I'm alert more and I have more energy," he said.
"Plateaus are really a mental thing," Dothard said.
"Jason has to do something different or harder to maintain results to keep on the track that he's on," Dothard said.
The body is adjusting to what you're doing."
