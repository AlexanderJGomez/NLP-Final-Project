"I used monies that should have been used for campaign purposes," Jackson, 47, acknowledged to the judge.
At a separate hearing later on Wednesday, former Chicago Alderman Sandra Stevens Jackson, 49, also pleaded guilty in a quavering voice to one count of filing false tax returns in connection with the misuse of her husband's campaign funds.
Jesse Jackson Jr., a Democrat, won re-election to Congress last year despite personal problems, including a mood disorder, that caused him to drop out of sight for months during the campaign.
Jesse Jackson Jr. had drive the ability and the talent to be the voice of a new generation, but he squandered that talent.
"I fully understand the consequences of my actions," he said.
That is not an excuse.
"Mr. Jackson engaged in this scheme starting in 2005.
According to court documents, Jackson's campaign credit cards were used for $582,772 in personal expenditures.
As part of the plea agreement, Jackson is supposed to repay the $750,000 in improperly used funds.
But there are references to her as "Co-Conspirator 1," a former consultant and later the manager of Jackson's re-election campaign.
Jackson dropped out of sight last spring and his office later said he was being treated at the Mayo Clinic for a mood disorder, depression and gastrointestinal problems.
The elder Jackson had no comment after Wednesday's hearings, telling reporters, "not today."
