"As soon as we have concluded the recertification of the airline, if they are capable, then their license will be reinstated," said Sam Adurogboye, a spokesman for the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority.
"The plane pushed the wall of our building in, and it hit everything," said Kingsley Okeke, who was inside at the time.
The pilot declared an emergency as the plane was on final approach to Murtala Muhammed International Airport, and witnesses said it appeared the plane was having engine trouble, said Oscar Wason, Dana Air's director of operations.
According to witnesses, the passenger plane appeared to be approaching the vicinity of the airport in Lagos high, its nose tilted upward, when it crashed 11 miles (18 kilometers) north of the runway, hitting the ground tail first, Wason said.
It had undergone routine maintenance checkups after every 200 hours of flight, and it had been inspected three days before the crash, Wason said.
The airline, which is privately owned and based in Lagos, began operations in 2008.
