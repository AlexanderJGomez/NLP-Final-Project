Former president of Poland, Lech Walesa, was a founder of the Solidarity trade union group that helped bring about about the downfall of communism in Poland in 1989.
Sometimes, however, it's good to take a look back to learn a lesson from the past.
Not to be broken down.
We were not broken down.
We knew we had to work together.
Soon after, our tiny union had 10 million members all over Poland.
And the world was in solidarity with us.
His regular visits to Poland, although hindered by the communist authorities, played this role.
Before that, we had been scattered and divided.
Of course, when I look at it today, from the perspective of years, I wish I had done a few things differently, but as for the path we took, I wouldn't have changed it.
Regrettably, I was not with them.
Lech Walesa: We are now in a very different place, in a new era.
Today Poland is a truly beautiful, modern and open country.
Lech Walesa: Back in 1989, nothing was a foregone conclusion.
However, I regret that not everything worked out as it should have.
In Poland, however, it stood at 23%.
It's alarming.
We live in an era of intellect, information and globalization.
It's a task not only for Poland, but also for the entire population of contemporary Europe and the world at large.
Once such a universal basis is established, we will succeed in building lasting and safe communities.
Otherwise it may be hard to maintain the world as it is at present.
