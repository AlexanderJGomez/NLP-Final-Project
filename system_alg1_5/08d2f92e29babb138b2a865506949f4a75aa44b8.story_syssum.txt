Dumig met Sahra through a photo workshop at Refugio, a shelter in Munich, Germany, for refugees and torture victims.
"It really impressed me how she deals with everything," Dumig said.
"Apart Together" serves not only as a documentation of Sahra, but as a far-reaching story about people from all backgrounds.
"Every one of these (refugees) have strong stories, and in the bureaucratic system, they are just a number or a document," Dumig said.
"But they are a person, they are people with emotions and lives."
Many of Dumig's photos are not of Sahra herself, but instead show her surroundings.
That's up to the viewer," Dumig said.
"It was just something we both got something out of," Dumig said.
