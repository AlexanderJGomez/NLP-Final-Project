(CNN) -- Two employees at the Baltimore, Maryland, branch of the liberal community organizing group ACORN were caught on tape allegedly offering advice to a pair posing as a pimp and prostitute on setting up a prostitution ring and evading the IRS.
"Stop saying prostitution," the woman, identified by the filmmaker as an ACORN tax expert, tells Giles.
The conservative filmmakers unsuccessfully attempted similar ruses at the group's offices in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Los Angeles, California, and New York, Levenson said.
However, authorities said that under Maryland law, such undercover video may not be admissible in court as evidence.
Founded in 1970, ACORN calls itself "the nation's largest grassroots community organization of low- and moderate-income people."
