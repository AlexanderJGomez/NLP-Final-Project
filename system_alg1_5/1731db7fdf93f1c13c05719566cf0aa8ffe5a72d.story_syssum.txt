Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Demonstrations that began with quiet determination on the internet more than three weeks ago erupted into riotous jubilation Friday evening, moments after it was announced that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was stepping aside.
"I did not believe it at first,"  Egyptian-American Sarah el-Helewsaid.
On the front lines of the movement, protester and actor Khalid Abdallah, best known for his role in "The Kite Runner," expressed complete shock at Mubarak's decision to step down, but said Egyptians now feel like "destiny is in their hands," and he praised supporters of their struggle.
"Hold your head high," Abdallah said they chanted, "you're an Egyptian."
"We could hear people, even before the end of the statement I heard people outside of the window shouting and honking their horns," she said.
No one imagined this day would come," he said.
"I stopped writing -- as a journalist -- because I felt there was nothing to write about,"  said Salah Marakby, a 76-year-old retiree.
"I just want to say to Hosni Mubarak and to Omar Suleiman and to all those people who thought that being in power means you can oppress people, you know, hard-luck guys, you know, at the end of the day, we have a choice and we've made our choice," he said.
"Today, I am telling you Egypt is going to be a democratic state," said Ghonim, who is on leave of absence from his job at Google.
"We have achieved what the people wanted," he said.
"Today is our time," a 46-year old woman told CNN.
"Certainly the voice of the people has been heard loud and clear," Sameh Shoukry said.
