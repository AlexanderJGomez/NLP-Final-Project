The suspect's anti-gay remarks were noted before the shooting took place, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said.
They didn't know it, Kelly said, but the suspect followed them.
Police later identified the suspect as Elliot Morales, 33.
There were no words that would aggravate the situation, and the victim did not know the perpetrator, he said.
On May 8, another gay man was assaulted by two men shouting anti-gay slurs as he left a bar in Manhattan's West Village, New York Police said.
"There is no words to describe the pain, 'cause this was not an attack on us, this was an attack on all of us," he said.
