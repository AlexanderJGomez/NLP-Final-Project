Blaine Harden, author of "Escape From Camp 14," wrote on his website that Shin had admitted several inaccuracies, including the length of time he spent in Camp 14.
It will be wrong for their witness accounts to lose credibility because of this incident," said Ahn Myeong Chul, a former North Korean camp guard who knows Shin.
While "Escape From Camp 14" was not the sole reason for the creation of the commission, Navi Pillay, then the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, urged the probe after meeting Shin and another North Korean prison camp survivor in December 2012.
Michael Kirby, chairman of the Commission of Inquiry into North Korea, said that Shin's testimony consisted of only two paragraphs in the 400-page report and that he was only one of hundreds of North Korean witnesses.
In a reversal of his story told for years, Shin told Harden on Friday that he had been transferred to another prison, Camp 18, when he was 6, instead of spending his entire life inside North Korea at the total control zone Camp 14, the author says on his website.
And Harden noted in his book that during the interview process, Shin at times was unreliable and "in many crucial instances, corrected his Korean memoir" -- an autobiography that Shin wrote in 2007, called "Escape to the Outside World," which was only published in Korean.
Ahn, the former prison camp guard who has known Shin for seven years, said he believes the crux of Shin's story is true and that torture in either camp is still the same.
