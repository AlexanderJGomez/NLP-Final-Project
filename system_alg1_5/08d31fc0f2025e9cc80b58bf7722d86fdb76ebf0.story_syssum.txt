The judge ordered that Couch's parents pay for the treatment facility, which was not identified.
If Couch violates the terms of his probation, he could face up to 10 years behind bars.
"Had he (Couch) not had money to have the defense there, to also have the experts testify, and also offer to pay for the treatment, I think the results would have been different," he said Wednesday after the proceedings.

No doubt about it, it would have helped," said Boyles.
"This has been a very frustrating experience for me," said prosecutor Richard Alpert.
