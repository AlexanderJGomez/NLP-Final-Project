Sawyer's father, Matthew Jones, said he was sure the tigers couldn't escape from their zoo exhibit.
"I assured him they couldn't," Matthew Jones said.
"We couldn't believe that we were there just a few hours earlier," Matthew Jones said.
"When we were there, we were discussing how it wasn't much of a stretch that they could jump over that gap," she said.
"It's always scary when you go someplace where there's large animals in captivity," she said.
"They're pretty spectacular animals when you see them up close," Arnold said.
"[Zookeepers] feed them raw meat," Arnold said.
"I guess it's just a risk you take, but it's very sad."
