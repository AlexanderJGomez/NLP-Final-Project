London (CNN) -- Seven men have been arrested in the United Kingdom on suspicion of terror offenses, West Midlands police said Friday.
Those arrests were not related to the Olympic or Paralympic Games, police said.
The firearms, which were not loaded when they were found, are being tested, and police are searching a number of addresses, the statement said.
The next level up is "severe," which means an attack is "highly likely," and the highest is "critical," meaning an attack is "expected imminently."
The Metropolitan Police is leading the "largest peacetime operation" seen in the United Kingdom as it seeks to keep the public safe, it said, with up to 9,500 police officers from London and elsewhere to be deployed on the busiest days of the Olympics.
"We were all in it together and when you're faced with armed police you can't really do anything else other than follow their instructions."
