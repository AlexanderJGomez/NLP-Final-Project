But the family of 85-year-old Merrill Newman of Palo Alto, California, has said he has been detained in North Korea since October 26.
"He has been detained somewhere in North Korea since that time," Newman's wife said in the statement.
The day before Newman was to leave North Korea, he and his tour guide met with "one or two Korean authorities," his son said.
"The tour arrangements were handled by the Korea International Travel Company," Thompson said.
The 10-day private tour, which included the use of a tour guide, was the culmination of months of planning, Newman's wife said.
North Korea has not publicly said why it is holding Newman.
It is also possible North Korean authorities mistook him for another Merrill Newman, a Korean War veteran awarded the Silver Star for valor in combat.
I didn't think much about it," Merrill Newman of Beaverton, Oregon, told CNN.
Newman's detentions bring to at least seven the number of American citizens who have been detained by North Korea, including four who allegedly entered the country illegally, according to the State Department.
Richardson's spokeswoman, Caitlin Kelleher, said he has been "in touch with his North Korean contacts" regarding Newman's detention.
