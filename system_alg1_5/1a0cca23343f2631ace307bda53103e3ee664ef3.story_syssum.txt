Kathleen Sebelius dives into discussing the swine flu at the White House after being sworn in.
Until her confirmation, the White House, which declared a public health emergency Sunday, was dealing with its first crisis without a secretary.
Sebelius met several obstacles during her confirmation hearings.
Sebelius, 60, is the daughter of former Ohio Gov.
A number of leading social conservatives have criticized Sebelius for her record on abortion, citing, among other things, her veto as governor of legislation that would have tightened abortion regulations in Kansas.
Some Republicans, however, have strongly defended Sebelius.
Former Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, Obama's first choice for secretary of health and human services, withdrew on February 3 after controversy erupted over his tax records and over his work in a field that some consider lobbying.
