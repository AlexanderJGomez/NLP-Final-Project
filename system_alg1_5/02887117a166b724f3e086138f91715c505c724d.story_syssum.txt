Lohan called his girlfriend again while she was talking with police, and she put him on speakerphone, it said.
After prosecutors authorized Lohan's re-arrest, officers went to a hotel, the Tahitian Inn, where he was staying.
"I did not hurt her," he said.
Lohan, 51, was arrested in Los Angeles in March in connection with alleged domestic violence and was charged with one misdemeanor count of corporal injury to a cohabitant.
