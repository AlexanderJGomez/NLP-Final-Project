Iran's top nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, acknowledged there was "some distance" between Iran and the six powers but seemed more positive in his assessment.
"It became clear that the positions of (the world powers) and Iran remain far apart on the substance," she said.
"The quality of the discussion was different because there was this back and forth, this Q and A," the official said.
"Creating confidence is a two-way street," he said.
Now, after many proposals put forward by Iran, it's the turn of the six world powers to respond, he said.
"The purpose of any sanctions is to put pressure in order to get this process to work," said Ashton.
The offer, he said, was aimed at establishing "a new bedrock of cooperation."
"As long as Iran does not take concrete steps to address the concerns of the international community about its nuclear program, the dual-track process continues.
The report, titled "Iran's Nuclear Odyssey," highlighted the fact that Tehran's quest for a nuclear program has been going on for more than half a century, beginning under the rule of the pro-American shah, Reza Pahlavi, and continuing under the revolutionary Islamic republic that overthrew him.
