Sara is a 115-pound federally protected loggerhead sea turtle who, if not for sheer luck, would be dead today.
The shooting of the turtle had to be deliberate, said Rich Moretti, who runs the Turtle Hospital in Marathon.
"Everyone in the Keys was absolutely offended that someone would come down and do that to one of our turtles," Moretti said.
Sara is a young turtle, about 12 years old.
Once that happened, Moretti said, "we knew it was time for her to go back home."
For the volunteers, the doctors, and Moretti, this was the kind of day that makes them smile.
