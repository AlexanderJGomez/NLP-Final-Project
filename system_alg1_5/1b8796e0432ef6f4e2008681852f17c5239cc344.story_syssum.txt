The sales were made at seven gun shows in Ohio, Tennessee and Nevada, the report says.
However, it is a federal felony for unlicensed sellers to sell a gun if they have a reason to believe the buyer would fail a background check.
He said he does not want to shut down gun shows but to change the law.
"This investigation reveals how easy it is for criminals and even terrorists to purchase firearms at gun shows and is further proof that we must close the gun show loophole," Lautenberg said in a written statement.
