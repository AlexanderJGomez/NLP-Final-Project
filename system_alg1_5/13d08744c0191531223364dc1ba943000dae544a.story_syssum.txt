Back then, women smoke and drank during pregnancy.
Back then, we didn't have playdates.
Today, my kids have piano, soccer, basketball, gymnastics and hip-hop dance.
What's different today, says Joanna Mazewski, a mom of two in Coconut Creek, Florida, is the level of paranoia.
"Now you have attachment parenting, then you have 'tiger moms,' and people tell you to co-sleep.
No.
"My kids then could walk to the swimming pool by themselves, and do things that I had no idea what they were doing," the mom of eight said.
Today, there's none of that.
"I just think there's a pendulum swing or backlash from those of us raised in the late '60s, early '70s, which was that we were really left to our own devices, and what was great about that, was there was a feeling of autonomy and self-direction," she said.
"The biggest difference is that I feel like you're all so concerned with keeping the kids busy, taking them everyplace and having to take up all their time with activities, where in the '60s, that wasn't the case," she said.
We need to let our kids chart their own course and make their own mistakes, said Mazewski, the Coconut Creek mom of two.
It's like, 'You've got to allow them to make their own decisions.'"
