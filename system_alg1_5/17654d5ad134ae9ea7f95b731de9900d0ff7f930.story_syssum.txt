An important starting point is for EU policy makers to understand that Russia acted out of weakness rather than strength.
The reason for this is clear.
Russia's economic difficulties were already beginning to mount before this crisis broke.
Indeed, the only metric by which Russia remains strong is its ability to generate scary headlines in the western media.
The aim should not be to shut Russia out.
If Russia won't be a good neighbor, the EU should help Ukraine to move on regardless.
Russia has been anxious about its own internal cohesion since the break up of the Soviet Union.
So far the measures European leaders have been prepared to discuss fall far short of what is required get Russia's attention.
Only a direct challenge to Russia's material and geopolitical interests is likely to have an impact on Putin's calculations.
