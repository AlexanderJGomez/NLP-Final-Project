The bus, owned by a North Carolina church, was carrying a group of seniors on their way back home from a religious conference when one of its tires malfunctioned, sending the bus across a median on Interstate 40 and crashing into an SUV and a tractor-trailer, authorities said.
Eight people were killed: Six on the eastbound bus; one of three occupants of the SUV, and the tractor-trailer driver, the Tennessee Highway Patrol said.
The group of senior citizens was called "Young at Heart," said Rick Cruz, the church's pastor.
Some people walked out of the bus on their own, but emergency personnel had to extricate others, Miller said.
"This was such a horrific crash that determining if seat belts were used or not ... may be extremely difficult to impossible to determine," he said.
