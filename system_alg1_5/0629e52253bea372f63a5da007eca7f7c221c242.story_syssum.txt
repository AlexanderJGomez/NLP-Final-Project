And as trivial as it may seem, a lot of that had to do with Red Lobster.
Now before you dismiss the notion that a chain restaurant could somehow be a beacon of light, you have to understand that in my neighborhood, if your family went to Red Lobster for dinner, that meant you were really doing something.
Red Lobster was the biggest culprit.
As I've gotten older and a bit more affluent, perhaps even snobbier, I recognize that with the exception of those delicious cheddar biscuits, most of Red Lobster's dishes pretty much taste the same.
The truth is, the working class has been getting pinched for decades.
Adjusted for inflation, that should be $23,817.03 today.
When you're living check to check, that's a lot of money.
That also happens to be the same year Red Lobster was founded.
