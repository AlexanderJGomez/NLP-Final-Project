(CNN) -- Season three of AMC's wildly popular zombie-apocalypse drama, "The Walking Dead," wrapped its midseason finale on Sunday night.
We have a very accelerated pace of storytelling, where we're trying to pack as much story into every episode, and yet, spending a lot of time developing our characters.
It's important for us to realize that these are desperate characters, living in a frantic world.
CNN: Speaking of the knife's edge, Michonne and The Governor were two highly anticipated characters at the start of this season.
That is unique.
He and I talked about what was driving The Governor, what his agenda was, and how that begins to unravel.
And The Governor wants history to be written about him.
CNN: Episode eight also saw the introduction of another new character, Tyreese (Chad Coleman), who's probably best known for his role on "The Wire."
He said, "If you could get Chad, that would be great."
Mazzara: You'd have to ask the actors.
The actors come in, and I guess it's the way that they are directed or it's written.
You could see that there's a lot of work that the actors do on their own characters, and we as writers listen and incorporate those dynamics into the scripts.
The audience has all this information.
Mazzara: All of the pieces are up and running: Woodbury, the prison, The Governor, Michonne, the reintroduction of Merle.
Mazzara: That is true.
What's great about Prince is -- first of all, he's a musical genius.
Mazzara: Maybe.
