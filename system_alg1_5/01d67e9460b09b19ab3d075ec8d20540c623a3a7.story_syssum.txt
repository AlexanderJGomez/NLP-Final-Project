(CNN) -- In 2009, du Pont heir Robert H. Richards IV, 47, was convicted of raping his 3-year-old daughter and served no jail time because, a judge said, he would "not fare well" in prison.
And Richards is wealthy and connected -- he's the heir to not one, but two fortunes provided to him by his predecessors.
She then sentenced him to eight years in prison, but suspended the prison time and put him on probation instead, writing: "Defendant will not fare well in Level 5 setting."

The sentence was outrageous, but blaming the judge is too easy.
But Tracy Richards has not given up.
The girl eventually told her grandmother, who informed Tracy Richards.
Likely knowing she's in for a fight, Tracy Richards has hired law firm Jacobs & Crumplar, attorneys more than capable of going after people who think they are untouchable.
