Despite calls from religious leaders, faith-based groups will not be exempt.
Rea Carey, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, was in the room as Obama signed the order and said it was an emotional moment.
One of those opponents, Stephen Schneck, director of the Institute for Policy Research & Catholic Studies at The Catholic University of America, said he was disappointed by Obama's decision regarding the religious exemption.
Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, had stronger words for Obama and worried that the Bush-era executive order would leave out some faith-based groups.
But on the federal legislative level, LGBT groups have struggled to enact similar legislation.
But the measure, which exempted religious groups from the would-be-law, did not make it to the House floor where Republicans opposed it.
