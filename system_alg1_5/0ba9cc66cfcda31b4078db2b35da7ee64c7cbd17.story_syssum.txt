The former bookkeeper, who wants to conceal her identity for reasons unrelated to her work at Noah's Wish, told CNN that donations came pouring into Noah's Wish soon after Hurricane Katrina.

She did tell CNN that the Noah's Wish board of directors set her salary and that she is now an employee, not a director, at SPCA International.
