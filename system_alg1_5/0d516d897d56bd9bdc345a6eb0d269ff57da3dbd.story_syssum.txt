The poll by the Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project, released Monday, found that a high proportion -- between 71% and 98% -- of Muslims questioned in Egypt, Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon viewed al Qaeda in an unfavorable way.
But they do not appear to have created a high level of support for al Qaeda in Pakistan, according to the Pew survey.
And with the passing of time, support for al Qaeda has fallen further in key parts of Pakistan, he said.
Twenty-one percent of the Muslims questioned there had a favorable view of al Qaeda, while 71% had an unfavorable one.
In Lebanon, 98% of those questioned held a negative opinion of al Qaeda.
A total of 1,206 adults were interviewed face-to-face in Pakistan between March 28 and April 13.
