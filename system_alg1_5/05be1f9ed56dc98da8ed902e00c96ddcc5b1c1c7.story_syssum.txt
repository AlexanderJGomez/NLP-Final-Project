Anthony, 25, is charged with capital murder in the death of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee.
In a free society, I cannot stop the press from reporting, broadcasting, and reporting," said Perry, the presiding judge in the case, explaining the need to pick a jury in Clearwater soon, before more potential jurors are swayed by the media coverage.
That would be followed by testimony by investigators, experts and others involved in the case -- including Casey Anthony's father, mother and brother, who have testified in pretrial hearings.
In an interview with NBC News afterward, her father, George Anthony, denied the claims and criticized Jose Baez, another of his daughter's attorneys, for questioning him about the allegations.
Friday's questioning also delved into the prospective jurors' knowledge of the Anthony case, including what and from where they had heard about it.
Casey Anthony has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
