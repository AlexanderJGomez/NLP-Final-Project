The request includes $105 million to boost the study of asteroids, both to reduce the risk of one hitting Earth and to start planning for a mission to "identify, capture, redirect, and sample" a small one.
The funding is aimed not only at finding a suitable asteroid to explore, but also at "protecting the planet," Bolden said.
Bolden called that the "bottom-line" figure, warning that any cuts would mean delays.
"But of course we'll be ramping up again as we approach 2020 and the next Mars rover," said Beth Robinson, the agency's chief financial officer.
