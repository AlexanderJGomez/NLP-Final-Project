The Nigerian government says that more than 200 girls abducted by Boko Haram in April are to be released as early as Monday, after it signed a ceasefire agreement with the Islamists.
Now, after the government made the announcement of their possible release, the hashtag has reawakened with messages of hope and anticipation.
David Cook, who studies jihad, has doubts about the deal going through.
Boko Haram has gone after Christians, foreigners and educated people, driving them out of the country's northeast.
And like ISIS, Boko Haram has ambitions for a caliphate or religious state, which would mean it has long-term ambitions to keep fighting, Cook said.
On April 14, Boko Haram militants raided the village of Chibok and kidnapped an estimated 276 teenage girls from a boarding school.

In spite of many promises to find and free them, the girls have remained in the terrorists' hands.
