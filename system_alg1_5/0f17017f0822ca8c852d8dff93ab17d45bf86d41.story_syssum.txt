But despite all that, when Tony Hatch, also a Brit, presented me with a song called "Downtown," I knew I wanted to record it.
Of course, it changed my life.
It was exhilarating, too.
Of course "Downtown" was only the beginning.
There was "I Know a Place," "Don't Sleep in the Subway," "Colour My World," "Days" and more.
Of course, there were the inevitable parties and general madness, but I could take it or leave it.
The British Invasion came and went, but left behind a body of music that lives on today.
