(CNN) -- A Missouri police officer shot and killed a teenager Tuesday night in Berkeley, Missouri, just 2 miles from the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, where Michael Brown was killed by police, an event that set off protests across the country.
It "does not appear that the police officer initiated" the incident, he said.
A small group of protesters marched along some roads, including a highway, on Wednesday night, with some help from police.
County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the shooting was tragic, but stressed the teen pointed a gun "straight out" at the officer, who fired in self-defense.
The officer, whom police did not name, lost balance and fell as he moved back in reaction, but managed to fire what investigators believe were three shots, hitting the gunman at least once, Belmar said.
Meanwhile, there was a shooting in St. Louis on Wednesday.
"He was supposed to come home," Green said.
The officer involved was given a body camera before he left for patrol, but he wasn't wearing it during the shooting, possibly because he was distracted when a supervisor gave it to him earlier Tuesday, Belmar said.
Four people were arrested on suspicion of assaulting officers, Belmar said.
One police officer was sent to an emergency room after injuring himself while trying to get away from the firework, Belmar said.
Authorities said Brown, who was black, wasn't armed at the time, but that he tried to take Wilson's gun while the officer was in his vehicle during an encounter in Ferguson.
