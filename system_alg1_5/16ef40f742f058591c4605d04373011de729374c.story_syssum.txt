SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea fired several short-range missiles toward the Sea of Japan on Saturday, an act that the U.S. watched closely and South Korea called provocative.
South Korea called the launches a provocative act, according to a government statement.
Another missile was launched about 10:45 a.m., the agency reported.
We are closely monitoring North Korea's activities and intentions," a U.S. official said.
"It is worrisome to some degree, but it is different from a ballistic missile launch," said Pinkston, of the International Crisis Group in Seoul, South Korea.
