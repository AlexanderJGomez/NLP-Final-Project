At a hearing on Thursday, Fourth District Judge James Taylor, who previously ruled Lonnie Johnson incompetent to be tried on sex crime charges, said there were no legal grounds for holding him.
In 2006, he was convicted of raping a teenage girl in Washington State, sent to prison for third degree rape and served less than a year, according to court documents.
"I am outraged that a convicted child sex offender, currently facing another round of accusations, could be released without being tried for current charges," Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert said.
Johnson allegedly abused Danner's daughter, who was his niece by marriage, for six years, starting at age eight in 1997.
