As a result, much of the Washington establishment, politicians of both parties, and the media are bracing for the apocalypse.
In reality, even if the sequester goes through, the federal government will spend more every single year.
This year, the sequester would slow the growth in federal spending by just $85 billion, from an expected, pre-sequester budget of $3.64 trillion -- less than a 2.3% reduction.
So, the real reduction in federal spending this year is just 1.2%.
That would leave domestic discretionary spending, after adjusting for inflation, at roughly the same level as 2009.
In fact, defense spending would really be cut, in the sense of actually spending less, over the next two years.
Keeping all this in perspective, over the entire 10-year period covered by the sequester, defense spending would average roughly $100 billion more each year (after adjusting for inflation) than we spent at the height of the cold war.
Of course, in the short term, there will be some layoffs and furloughs.
Given that the private sector generally puts those resources to a more productive use, it is likely that government spending destroys more jobs over the long run than it creates.
