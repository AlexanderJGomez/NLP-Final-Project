But as neural devices become more complicated, and go wireless, some scientists say the risks of "brain hacking" should be taken seriously.
According to Kohno and his colleagues, who published their concerns July 1 in Neurosurgical Focus, most devices carry few security risks.
"It's very hard to design complex systems that don't have bugs," Kohno said.
"It happened on two separate occasions," said computer science graduate student Tamara Denning, a co-author on the paper.
Despite the risks, Kohno said, most new devices aren't created with security in mind.
It's never too early to start thinking about security issues, said neural engineer Justin Williams of the University of Wisconsin, who was not involved in the research.
"These kinds of security issues have to proceed in lockstep with the technology," Williams said.
gets you 90 percent there, and that's the most important thing."
