"Bob" Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, and Dwight Chapin.
Haldeman, Ehrlichman and Chapin were enthusiastic amateur cinematographers.
When Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, he arranged to have his presidential papers sent to his home in San Clemente, California, assuming that they were his personal property.
Congress was concerned that Nixon would destroy papers relevant to the Watergate investigation, so it passed the Presidential Records and Materials Preservation Act of 1974 ("PRMPA"), 44 U.S.C.
Nixon v. Adm'r of Gen. Services, 433 U.S. 425 (1977).
In 1980, Nixon filed an action for just compensation under the Takings Clause, which he eventually won, after more than a decade of litigation.Nixon v. U.S., 978 F.2d 1269 (1992).
Under the PRMPA regulations, purely personal material was removed from the home movies and returned to Haldeman, Ehrlichman and Chapin.
So, that's how we heard about the home movies.
We hired Jeff Kreines, inventor of the Kinetta film scanner, to travel to the Nixon Library and make the scans.
He scanned every frame of the entire collection at a resolution much higher than HD video, and delivered them to us as digital files.
