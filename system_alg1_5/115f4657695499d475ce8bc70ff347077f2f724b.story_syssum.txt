"Frequency modulation," exclaims South African radio shock jock Gareth Cliff in an online video posted earlier this year.
Sure, there may now be digital radio and more interaction between programs and their listeners today, Cliff explains.
"Mobile is definitely where the action is," Cliff says.
"Anybody who isn't adaptable to the possibilities that mobile represents is going to miss out on a huge business opportunity," according to Cliff.
The most intriguing development, however, is what Cliff Central is doing on the hugely popular mobile communication app, WeChat.
"I think that's a real value proposition to an audience," Cliff says.
"It's also a very big commercial proposition and it ties radio in most especially in a measurable way."
Closer to Cliff Central in South Africa, other web-only stations have popped-up in recent years.
For Cliff, these are challenges, but they are not insurmountable.
Given the popularity of radio and the growth of smart phone devices in South Africa and across the continent, there will be plenty of observers interested in how Cliff's "un-radio" project turns out.
