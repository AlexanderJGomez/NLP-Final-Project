But Putin's moves on the European chessboard are now checkmating Russia, too.
Over nearly four years of war, Russia has given Bashar al-Assad political cover, while Iran has provided most of the Syrian leader's military muscle.

And by the end of 2014, a new government in Iraq, trying to be more inclusive, had taken encouraging first steps.
It would now engage with Cuba, like allies in Latin America, Canada and Europe.
After all, demographics have changed, and they are much more eager to engage than their parents, grandparents and the remaining hard-liners in Congress.
