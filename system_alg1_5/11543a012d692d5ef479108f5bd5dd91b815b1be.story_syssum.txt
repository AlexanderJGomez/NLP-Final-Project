SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- Across the country, insurance companies, trial lawyers and legislators are closely watching a November referendum in the state of Washington that could change how insurers are required to treat their customers.
"Insurance companies have figured out that they can make more money if they don't pay your claim,'' said Washington state Rep. Steve Kirby.
"The insurance companies stepped in and said, 'Consumers, you get to decide if you want to do this,' '' said Dana Childers, executive director of the Liability Reform Coalition, which is leading the insurance company charge to defeat the new law.
"If companies act in good faith, [they are] not going to have a problem," Kreidler said.
There's going to be no treble damages, because if companies deal with their customers in good faith there's no penalty."
It's not a new tactic by the insurance companies.
And every insurance company is under the same pressure to do it," Hartwig said.
The two accidents, she said, resulted in back injuries that required medical treatment.
The case went to court, where a jury, too, ruled for Tribble.
Finally, four years after the accident, the company paid her claim.
