Before that stop was over, the officers had seized $100,000, which the men said was money to play poker.
"It violates due process for Americans," said Larry Salzman, an attorney for the group.
It shouldn't be taking money from people who have not been charged, let alone convicted, of any crime."
Now, however, they are suing to get the rest of the money back and have asked for unspecified damages.
That deputy, Lee Dove, asks one motorist in a dash-cam video how much money he has on hand.
One of them said their colleague, Dove, "had been going through a tough time" and had called them to complain about our presence.
The newly elected sheriff in Humboldt County, Mike Allen, said Dove is still with the department but has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of a state investigation.
"With this new policy, effective immediately, the Justice Department is taking an important step to prohibit federal agency adoptions of state and local seizures, except for public safety reasons," said Attorney General Eric Holder.
