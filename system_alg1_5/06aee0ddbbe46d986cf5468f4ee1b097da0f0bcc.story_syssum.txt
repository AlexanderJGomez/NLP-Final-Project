Edie is a proud blizzard baby, and her parents have already bought her a snowsuit for this year.
"It was cold, and we took a bath together," she told the newspaper, referring to husband Hansell.
Edie Coddington is wearing one of those shirts, even though her parents, Odele and Ian, were out of town when the storms hit.

"The snow stayed on the ground throughout December, January, and into February.
