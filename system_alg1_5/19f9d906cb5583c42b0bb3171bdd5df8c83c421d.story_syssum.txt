Gun control is a "simmering issue" in these states, said Bloomberg spokesman Stu Loeser.
"The NRA praises Tom Foley, calling him pro-gun," a voice in a new Connecticut ad says.
And Foley promised he'd sign a bill to weaken them, undermining our gun safety laws."
He has also said he would repeal Malloy's gun control legislation.
In Maryland, Brown holds a substantial lead over his opponent, Republican Larry Hogan.
"We take these elections one at a time," Loeser said.
