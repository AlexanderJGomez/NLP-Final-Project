The incident occurred last year at a Los Angeles, California, hospital, Quaid told members of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.
"I am in the entertainment industry, but what happened to us, and what is happening in the courts of our country, is no fiction," Quaid said in a statement prepared for members of the House panel.
Committee Chairman Henry Waxman, D-California, said, "This is exactly the wrong time for the FDA to say, 'Trust us.'
In November, Quaid's 12-day-old twins, Thomas Boone and Zoe Grace, were undergoing intravenous antibiotic treatment for a staph infection at Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Hospital.
He also learned that the labels' similarity led to an overdose of infants at an Indianapolis, Indiana, hospital in 2006.
However, Quaid said, Baxter failed to recall the previous bottles that were in hospitals.
Quaid and his wife, Kimberly, have filed suit against Baxter in state court.
