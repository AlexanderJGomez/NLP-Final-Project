You don't have a charger with you, and even if you did, there would be nowhere to plug it in.
"We rely heavily on our cell phones for many essential tasks during the day," says Milisavljevic, now 26, who founded his company, Strawberry Energy, when he received the first order for his charger.
"I was fascinated with clean technology, and I wanted to find a way that it could benefit people in their everyday life by solving a common problem -- running out of battery," says Milisavljevic.
"For example, if you had a network of Strawberry Trees spread around the city, you could check if there's ice on the road in your street, what park is the quietest if you want to relax," explains Milisavljevic, "or if you have asthma or allergies, you could see what's the air quality in the area you're planning to go to," he adds.
There is hardly any innovation in city living, so our dream is to bring new technology to outdoor public spaces, so we can improve the quality of life in our cities," he says.
