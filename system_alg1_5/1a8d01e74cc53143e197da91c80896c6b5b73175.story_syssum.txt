Almost 600 items are being offered in RR Auction's Space & Aviation online sale, which begins Thursday and runs through May 22.
Items from other Apollo missions as well as Mercury, Gemini, and space shuttle missions also are being auctioned.
Other artifacts include signed maps, patches, photos, and even a full spacesuit.
"Objects coming directly from moon walkers and that have been in private collections since returning to Earth are unquestionably the most sought after," said Bobby Livingston, executive vice present of RR Auction.
