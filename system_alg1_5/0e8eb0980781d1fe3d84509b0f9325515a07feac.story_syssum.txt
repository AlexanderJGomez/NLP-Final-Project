Erick Munoz,  husband of Marlise Munoz, broke down in tears after Judge R.H. Wallace told John Peter Smith Hospital  to act on his order by 5 p.m. Monday.
Jessica Janicek argued that the hospital was "utilizing (Marlise Munoz's) body as a science experiment."
Once there, Erick Munoz said, he was told his wife "was for all purposes brain dead."
Erik Munoz and other family members said the hospital should abide by her wishes -- which weren't written down but, they said, relayed verbally to them -- and not have machines keep her organs and blood running.
And when they die, their fetus dies with them.
