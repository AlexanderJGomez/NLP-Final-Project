Among those charged are Gbagbo's son Michel, former party leader Affi N'Guessan, and former prime minister Gilbert Aké N'Gbo.
Noël Dje, a representative of the Office of the Public Prosecutor, told CNN those indicted remain under arrest.
"According to our information, everything happened out of the blue yesterday, with no warning.
"Despite frequent promises of impartial justice, the Ouattara government has not charged anyone from the Republican Forces -- the troops that supported him in removing Gbagbo and that are now the country's military -- for the grave crimes committed during the post-election period," Human Rights Watch said in a statement on August 5.
Ouattara Sunday said he was extending an "olive branch" to former members of Gbagbo's party.
