Debbie Purdy, 46, who has multiple sclerosis, has been waging a lengthy legal battle to clarify Britain's ambiguous laws on assisted suicide.
This decision means that I can make an informed choice, with Omar (Puente, her husband), about whether he travels abroad with me to end my life."
Doing so is technically illegal under a 1961 law, and anyone found guilty faces up to 14 years in prison.
Lord James Hope of Craighead, in his ruling on the case, emphasized that the verdict did not grant Purdy's husband immunity from prosecution.
Before the ruling in her favor, she had said she would travel abroad on her own to die if she lost the case, so her husband would be sure not to face prosecution.
She died in England after motor neuron disease, an incurable degenerative disease, caused respiratory failure in May 2002.
