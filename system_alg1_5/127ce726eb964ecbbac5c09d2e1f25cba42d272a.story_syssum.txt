"It's coming back into fashion," she told CNN.
Masoom, another University of Ghana student, said he thought women looked good in beads.
"It's attractive," he told CNN.
He told CNN that beads were once exchanged for slaves, alcoholic drinks, and textiles.
"Because of that new potential, we don't just produce necklaces and bracelets, we produce home decoration," Torda told CNN.
"Of course, the potential is endless."
"They [the beads] mean so much to me," Tairee told CNN.
