"The Nobel committee has to admit they are in the minority," said Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu on Thursday.
"Liu Xiaobo broke Article 105, a crime of instigating the subversion of state power," Jiang said Thursday.
It is unclear, officially, how China's stance has affected nations who have said they are not attending the award ceremony.
An official from the United Nations said the U.N. is not going to attend the ceremony, but said that is not unusual.
Labeed Abawi, Iraq's deputy foreign affairs minister, said officials had not yet decided if they would attend the ceremony.
