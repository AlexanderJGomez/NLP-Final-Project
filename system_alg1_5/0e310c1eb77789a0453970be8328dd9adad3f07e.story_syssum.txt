BURBANK, California (CNN) -- Laura Ling on Wednesday expressed the shock she and Euna Lee felt when former President Clinton showed up in Pyongyang, North Korea, to help secure the two journalists' release.
North Korea pardoned Ling, 32, and Lee, 36, after Clinton's brief trip Tuesday to Pyongyang.
"The past 140 days have been the most difficult, heart-wrenching time of our lives," Ling said.
He expressed his gratitude to Clinton and President Obama and his administration who "have been deeply involved in this humanitarian effort."
The women hugged their families, who were waiting at the bottom of the stairs.
"I am very happy that after this long ordeal, Laura Ling and Euna Lee are now home and reunited with their loved ones," Clinton said in a statement.
"I can tell she has gone through a lot," Ling said.
"I figured, sooner or later, they'd be back," he said.
"I spoke to my husband on the airplane, and everything went well," she said.
He described Clinton's trip as a "solely private mission to secure the release of two Americans."
Clinton's mission came as the United States and its allies in the region are seeking to persuade North Korea to return to the stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
Clinton had considered visiting North Korea in 2000, near the end of his second term as president.
