That personal app grew into Weduary, a real product that helps people design wedding sites, and Morin went on to create her own lifestyle how-to company called Brit + Co., which combines crafting, homemaking and a bit of tech.
"There was really no voice or teacher, specifically on the female side, who was really sharing all of these new innovations with those inspired to live creatively," she said of the maker culture.
"Being from Texas, it really showed who I am: a little bit style, a little bit country and a little bit tech," said Morin.
In an effort to differentiate herself from the doyennes of DIY like Stewart, Morin avoids saying the word "craft," which she thinks makes people think of popsicle sticks.
At Brit and Co., Morin's agreeable, bubbly personality is a big part of the product.
"In the past it was Disney, Rockefeller, Walmart; all these huge companies that have lasted for decades had a person's name in the brand."
Morin says that, like her, the current generation is interested in homemaking and DIY, but suffers from a lack of time and proper training.
