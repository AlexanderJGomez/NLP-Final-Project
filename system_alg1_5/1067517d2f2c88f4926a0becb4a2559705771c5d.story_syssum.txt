Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania (CNN) -- Starting a business is never easy, but in Tanzania, the obstacles for women can be particularly fierce.
"I thought, okay, instead of chasing money through the banks, which I cannot get, I started looking at what I had ... it was a cow," she recalls.
Kisyombe sold milk from her cow, Sero, in order to raise money to start her business.
"She has created a number of jobs for fellow Tanzanians," says Kisyombe.
"(These steps) may look small, but actually the impact is huge," says Kisyombe.
The key to empowerment, Kisyombe believes, is education, and to that end, she raised money to build the Mukuza Girl's Secondary School in Dar Es Salaam.
