The Sewol sank on April 16, killing 304 people, mostly high school students who were on their way to a field trip to Jeju island, off South Korea's southern coast.
"We, the families of the missing victims, are still living the day --  April 16, 2014," said Park, who is in poor health, but refusing treatment.
On April 16, the Sewol ferry, carrying hundreds of high school students, began sinking after taking a sharp turn.
As the ferry tilted sideways, water seeped in and objects in the ship toppled over, injuring people and blocking their way out.
"Recently, there was an announcement that it is technically possible to salvage Sewol ferry.
Since the days immediately after the disaster, families have criticized the government over its response.
Park, the South Korean president, pledged major reforms, dismantled the coast guard and vowed an investigation into what went wrong.
In the case of Sewol, the ferry was found to be loaded with double its capacity.
In the immediate aftermath, South Korean prosecutors arrested the captain, crew members and business associates.
Sewol's captain, Lee Joon-seok, who was widely derided for jumping to safety, was sentenced to 36 years in prison for abandonment causing death and injury, and violating sea laws.
