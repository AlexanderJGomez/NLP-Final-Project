Fourteen people were killed when the plane slammed into a cemetery March 22 in Butte, and investigators immediately began focusing on why the pilot asked to divert the flight from Bozeman, Montana, to Butte, 80 miles to the west.
The report said that at 2:27 p.m., controllers asked the pilot whether he had the airport in sight and "the pilot indicated he had one more cloud to maneuver around."
A minute later, the pilot reported the airport in sight and controllers "terminated radar service."
One witness with aviation experience reported that the airplane was west of the runway centerline and appeared too high to land on the runway," the report said.
The preliminary NTSB report said "visual meteorological conditions prevailed" at both Bozeman and Butte.
