The tail section, marked with part of the airline's logo, was detected by sonar early Wednesday, said Bambang Soelistyo, the head of Indonesia's search and rescue agency.
"The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder are absolutely crucial to gaining an understanding of what happened to this aircraft," said Greg Waldron, the managing editor of Flightglobal, an aviation industry website.
"They might have fallen free, which could create some issues," he said.
In this case, officials hope it will contain any possible discussion of the crisis that eventually brought down the jet, Waldron said.
They also are striving to find the black box," Soelistyo told Indonesia's Channel tvOne.
Soelistyo also said Wednesday that another body had been found in the sea, bringing the total to 40.
There were also citizens of Britain, France, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea.
