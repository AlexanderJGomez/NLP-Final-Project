The 22-month-old child who died April 27 of the flu, also called H1N1, had neonatal myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disease, said the report, which was written by a virus investigation team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and published online in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Of the 22 hospitalized patients for whom data were available, four were younger than 5.
As of Tuesday, 18 of the 22 patients who had been hospitalized had recovered, it said.
Flu virus "prefers lower humidity and lower temperatures for transmission," she said.
Another 21 cases are suspected in Brazil, he said.
The man was hospitalized in the capital and released after he recovered, Ocana said.
We shouldn't be seeing this much influenza and it's with a new virus and that's the cause fo the concern."
