The CDC had hoped that about 40 million doses of H1N1, or swine flu, vaccine would be available by the end of October.
As of Wednesday, 11.4 million doses of flu vaccine were available to be ordered and 8 million doses had been ordered by state health departments, the CDC said.
Georgia, for example, is going to get less than half of the amount of H1N1 vaccine that it was expecting to receive this month, state Public Health Commissioner Dr. Rhonda Medows said.
The CDC is not expecting widespread availability of the H1N1 vaccine until the end of this month or beginning of November, and "we know it's not enough, given the demand," Schuchat said.
Health care workers, pregnant women and people with underlying illness also should be among the first to get vaccine, they say.
