Many students at the university in East Garden City, New York, wore white ribbons on their gowns in tribute to Andrea Rebello, CNN affliate WCBS reported.
One shot hit Rebello in the head, Maureen Roach, a spokeswoman with the Nassau County police, said.
The officer, fearing for his life, drew his gun and fired, Roach said.
Rebello, a junior, was majoring in public relations.
