Staff at the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program in Charleston, South Carolina, allegedly shared information about the test on reactor operations among themselves, officials said of their findings so far.
There is no indication students were involved.
Adm. John Richardson, director of the propulsion program, said the investigation is ongoing but did not disclose what information may have been exchanged.
"With respect to the morale and the necessity to pass these exams in order to advance, that's not really a dimension of our program," he said.
