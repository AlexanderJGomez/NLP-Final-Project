Winner: 11-year-old Sebastien De La Cruz, "El Charro de Oro" (the golden horseman) who became a national story after he sang the national anthem at Game 3 of the NBA playoff series between the San Antonio Spurs and Miami Heat and showed a lot of a talent, heart and class.
"So illegal aliens can sing The National Anthem @ games now?"
On the other, you have an angry mob filled with hatred and racism that, cloaked in the anonymity of Twitter, spews invective at a child.
"For those that said something bad about me, I understand it's your opinion," Sebastien told CNN.
"To be honest," he said, "It's just the people how they were raised.
Then, I get enraged.
The part about De La Cruz being Mexican-American, as opposed to a Mexican immigrant, is essential to the story.
"They don't know my life," he told reporters about his tormentors.
He's not a Mexican.
There is a difference.
"To be invited back to sing the national anthem is just amazing because now I know the San Antonio Spurs like how I sing," Sebastien said.
This was a message.
