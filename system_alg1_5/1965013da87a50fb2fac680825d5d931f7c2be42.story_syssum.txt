"I announce to you today that I am withdrawing my candidacy in deference to my brother, Haider al-Abadi, in the highest interest of the country," he said.
Al-Maliki's acquiescence was a turnaround for the man, who in recent days called the appointment of al-Abadi unconstitutional and said he would not step down.
But with world leaders, diplomats, members of his own political party and the country's most revered Shiite cleric pressuring him to step down, al-Maliki gave up the fight.
"He still has a challenging task in putting a government together, but we are modestly hopeful that the Iraqi government situation is moving in the right direction," he said.
According to his sources in the field, there was fighting ongoing between ISIS and Kurdish fighters, known as Peshmerga, in the town of Tuz Khurmatu.
As of Thursday, there were about 15,000 Yazidi refugees from Iraq who arrived at the Newroz camp in Syria, the U.N. refugee agency said.
Thousands more are arriving, the agency said.
While CNN cannot independently confirm the claim, it follows reports by survivors who describe ISIS fighters grabbing families and separating the men from the women and children.
