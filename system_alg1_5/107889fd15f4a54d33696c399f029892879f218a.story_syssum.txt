"I am glad to be able to put this past me and move on with my life and my career," Lohan said in a written statement released Wednesday afternoon.
A report prepared by Lohan's probation officer and released Wednesday said, "It would appear that the defendant's criminal conduct is increasing in seriousness and severity," yet it suggested she serve her sentence on probation and not in jail.
Sautner said drugs and alcohol are not the root of Lohan's legal troubles, but  "she's got other problems for which she self-medicates."
"I have already started my community service at the Downtown Women's Center and thank everyone there for their warm welcome," Lohan said.
