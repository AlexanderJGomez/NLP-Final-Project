The head of the group that gives U.S. movies their ratings, however, said the smoke has been clearing from youth-rated movies, a result of the film industry's sensitivity to the issue.
"In all, 56 percent of the top box office movies with smoking released between May 2007 and May 2009 were youth-rated films -- G, PG or PG-13," he said.
Overall, 55 percent of the  movies rated in the past two years showed some smoking, but 75 percent of those with smoking scenes were given R ratings, Graves said.
"Millions of children have been exposed to the main star of the film, Hugh Jackman, with a cigar in his mouth in various scenes," Frost said.
The alliance will keep an online scorecard throughout the summer to count "how many tobacco impressions each studio delivers to G, PG and PG-13 audiences," she said.
"Smoking is rated like all the other factors, including violence and sex," she said.
"Any movie with smoking should be rated R," he said.
