"I organized this attack but not to the extent that it happened," he is heard saying in a video released by police.
The characters in this drama include Dmitrichenko's girlfriend, Anzhelina Vorontsova.
Tsiskaridze, incidentally, was also a contender for the artistic director job that Filin got.
RIA Novosti reported that before the attack, Filin suffered months of intimidation, including threatening phone calls.
Dmitrichenko, who studied Filin's schedule, called Lipatov and Zarutsky when he saw Filin leave the theater on the cold night of January 17, police said.
"I didn't see what happened there," Lipatov told them in a video released by police.
In the meantime, Galina Stepanenko, a former principal dancer, will run the company.
His colleagues are now working to ensure his artistic vision isn't lost.
