If party moderates break from the GOP leadership on these issues, it dramatically increases Kagan's chances of overcoming a possible filibuster and winning confirmation as the country's 112th Supreme Court justice.
While dean at Harvard Law, Kagan said she "abhorred" the military's "discriminatory recruitment policy."
Earlier in the day, Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins said she doesn't have any concerns about Kagan's experience.
The support of Brown and Collins alone, combined with a unified Democratic caucus, would be enough to ensure Kagan's confirmation.
"She said it'd be helpful to the public and to the court," he said.
A quick declaration in favor of Kagan, on the other hand, could strike some voters as political opportunism.
She also met with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, and Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the committee's top Republican.
