But such a large amount of ice melted, it revealed the distinct island.
"I very quickly realized two things," he told CNN's Anderson Cooper during a visit to the island earlier this year.
Many global warming experts say the phenomenon, if unchecked, is capable of altering the world's climate and geography.
Other scientists and observers, a minority compared to those who believe the warming trend is something ominous, say it is simply the latest shift in the cyclical patterns of a planet's life.
There are several possible reasons for the warming, scientists say.
"For the last 30 years, there's no way there's anything natural that can explain it," Stephen Schneider, a professor of environmental studies at Stanford University in California, said.
"We've suddenly taken to reading tea leaves," he said.
Since then, there's been a few tenths of global warming, so we're proclaiming global warming."
"We don't know why, but it's perfectly clear that glaciers change even though the temperature is cooling at the place that they've occurred," he said.
The models don't predict it," he said.
"Exactly how much it's going to warm up, we don't know," Schneider said.
