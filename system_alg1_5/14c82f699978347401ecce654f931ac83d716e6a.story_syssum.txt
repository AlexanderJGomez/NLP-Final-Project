Washington (CNN) -- Parents are finding it more difficult to keep their children's private personal data from being collected by mobile phone apps, according to a new report.
"Even more troubling, the results showed that many of the apps shared certain information with third parties -- such as device ID, geolocation, or phone number -- without disclosing that fact to parents," the FTC said.
"Parents should be given the information they need to make informed decisions about whether to allow their children to use apps with these capabilities," the FTC report said.
As of September, there were more than 700,000 apps available in Apple's App Store, a 40 percent increase since December 2011, and more than 700,000 apps available in Google Play, an 80 percent increase since the beginning of 2012, the FTC said.
