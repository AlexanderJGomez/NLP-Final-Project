"You can't use taxpayer money to pay out $18 billion in bonuses," an angry Sen. Claire McCaskill says.
"We have a bunch of idiots on Wall Street that are kicking sand in the face of the American taxpayer," an enraged McCaskill said on the floor of the Senate.
McCaskill's proposed compensation limit would cover salaries, bonuses and stock options.
"If you somehow take that bonus out of the economy, it really will create unemployment," he said on CNN's "American Morning."
