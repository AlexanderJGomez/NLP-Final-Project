Dr. Joseph Adelegan has pioneered new energy sources, including using cow waste to create cooking gas.
Adelegan tells CNN there are now plans to roll it out across most of Africa, including Zimbabwe, Kenya and Egypt.

We're thinking in terms of basic lighting, they will be able to use their TV, cassette player, that sort of thing, but it will not be able to power a refrigerator.
"This can never replace fossil fuels because of the huge demand we have for them, but we can help to reduce greenhouse emissions by creating alternative sources of energy," he said.

So that local farmers get a real headstart when they need it most," Norphel says.
For Norphel, there are several advantages of an artificial glacier over a natural one.
Natural glaciers, on the other hand, are located way up in the mountains and they melt slowly in summer, releasing water to the villages quite late.
"The funding is not sufficient," he said.
And there are not many to go around," he says.
