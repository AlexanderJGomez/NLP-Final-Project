"Mind the Gap".
But Arsenal has been here before.
A year ago Monday, the man known as "AVB" was sent packing from Chelsea with his reputation in ruin.
It was Bale, of course, who proved the man for the occasion, firing Tottenham ahead eight minutes before the break with a coolly taken finish -- his 20th of the season.
In fact, not since 1995 has Tottenham finished above Arsenal in England's top division, a statistic which will surely be consigned to history at the end of the current campaign.
"It was very, very important for what it means, but obviously nothing is finished yet," Villas-Boas told Sky Sports.
"Last year, by this time, Arsenal made the difference of seven points to Tottenham and we know how it finished," Villas-Boas added.
"That's not the impression I got from the game today," he told Sky Sports News.
"We were not efficient in those decisive zones, not at the back or up front.
He added: "It's very frustrating, but we have to put the energy in every game like we did today and keep going, you never know.
"We had a terrible 20 minute period and were punished for our mistake on the first goal," coach Andrea Stramaccioni told Sky Italia.
In the late game, Roma defeated Genoa 3-1 with Francesco Totti on target.
"We had to work hard for the win, it wasn't brilliant or glamorous, but in return for 90 minutes work, we got three points.
