ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Consumer advocate Clark Howard revealed to listeners of his radio show on Wednesday that he has prostate cancer.

"Prostate cancer caught early is not a walk in the park, but is not really that big a deal," Howard said.
There are various options for treating prostate cancer, all with different approaches.
Get your guy in to see the doctor, especially if you're 40 and up," he said.
