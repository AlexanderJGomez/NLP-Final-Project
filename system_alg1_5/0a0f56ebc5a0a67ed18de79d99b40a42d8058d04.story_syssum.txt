He had been charged with trying to attack the royal family, authorities said.
Five people, as well as the driver, were killed and 12 were wounded in the incident, which happened during the country's annual Queen's Day celebration, police said.
The crowds were behind barriers off the road, but security officials and journalists, including many cameramen, were in the road as the car went by.
"Queens Day will never be the same," the Trouw newspaper said.
Is that still possible now the royal family has been the target of an attack?"
Queen's Day is a national holiday in the Netherlands, the Netherlands Antilles, and Aruba.
The day is marked with the color orange all over the country as a reference to the colors of the royal family, who come from the House of Orange-Nassau.
