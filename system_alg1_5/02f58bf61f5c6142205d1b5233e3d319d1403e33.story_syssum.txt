LONDON, England (CNN) -- From "Gladiator" to "The Lion King", "Pirates of the Caribbean" to "The Simpsons," film composer Hans Zimmer's versatile and imaginative scores have added aural color, light and shade to the on-screen action.
This usually doesn't happen, so it's a whole industry based on the fallacy that we, the filmmakers, will actually come up with some good ideas and meet our deadlines, when really we sit in our rooms by ourselves and knock our heads against the wall until something happens.
HZ: It changes all the time.
With "The Simpsons," I thought, "Hang on a second, they've been around for years but none of the characters have any themes really."
CNN: Your score for "Gladiator" really stands out.
And I'm driving through this wood and I get to a dirt track; and it's a miserable day, only the way England in November can be.
And I thought, "How benign, how wonderful.
But when it comes to music, it's tricky territory: what's he going to say to me?
HZ: I go there.
I told him, "See if you can buy any instruments or record some of the stuff."
HZ: Terror.
I finished "Pirates," had one day off and got into "The Simpsons" and it's a very different language.
HZ: This was pretty early on in my career.
HZ: With animated film you have to create the sonic world; there's nothing there.
HZ: It depends.
It doesn't matter how good they are.
I can think of a handful: "Once upon a time in the West," Randy Newman's score for "Avalon," "Brazil," Michael Cayman's score; just using one song and creating a whole world out of it.
They have a point of view, they have a great tune attached to them and incredible craftsmanship.
