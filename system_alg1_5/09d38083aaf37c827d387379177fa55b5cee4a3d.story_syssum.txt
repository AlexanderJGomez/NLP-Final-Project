However, an eruption from Bardarbunga that began on August 31 continues to this day and has now emitted the most lava of any volcano in Iceland since 1947 and shows no sign of stopping.
However, this could change at any time.
If this occurs, the eruption may well affect some flights.
However, we should not see any repeat of the massive airspace closure in Europe in 2010, the biggest since World War II, following the eruption of the Eyjafjallaj√∂kull volcano.
To be sure, there is a small chance of a much more significant eruption.
Taken overall, there remains a possibility of a significant ash eruption in Iceland that may well impact some flights.
However, despite all the risks, it is still unlikely we will witness a repeat of the travel chaos that brought European airspace to a standstill in 2010.
