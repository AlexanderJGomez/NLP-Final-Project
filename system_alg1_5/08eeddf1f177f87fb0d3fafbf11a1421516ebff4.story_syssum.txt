The determination, disputed by Syria, comes as forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have made gains in the past few weeks.
The weapons will be provided by the CIA, the officials said.
The United States has also ruled out sending troops, or putting "boots on the ground" in Syria.
Those forces included communications and intelligence specialists aimed at assisting the Jordanians and "be ready for military action" if Obama were to order it, a Defense Department official said.
The United States also has deployed Patriot missiles to Turkey, which also borders Syria.
"As for NATO, the Patriot deployment will ensure effective protection for Turkey against any missile attack, whether the missiles carry chemical weapons or not," he said.
â€¢ Airstrikes: The U.S. military has enough air power in the region to take action against Syria, according to officials.
"It could embroil the United States in a significant, lengthy and uncertain military commitment," he said.
