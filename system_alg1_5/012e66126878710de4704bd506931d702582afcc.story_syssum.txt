The problem, environmentalists say, is just that.
According to the USDA, just over a quarter of the country's food -- about 25.9 million tons -- gets thrown in the garbage can every year.
Methane, the gas food waste produces, traps 23 times as much heat in the atmosphere as the same amount of CO2, the EPA says.
The University of Arizona believes that if Americans cut their food waste in half, it would reduce the country's environmental impact by 25 percent.
It is the exact process, in fact, which goes on in landfills.
However, while the potential for food waste-as-energy seems big, the practical applications for it are currently very small (only 0.4 percent of the UK's food waste is processed by AD, for example), with critics of AD pointing out that the amount food waste can contribute to the energy supply are negligible to say the least.
And there has been a big push, in Europe in particular, to cut back on the amount of biodegradable waste that is being sent to landfills.
It also has 779 biogas buses and the world's first biogas train, which, according to The Ecologist, cost just 1 million euros ($1.4 million) to develop.
