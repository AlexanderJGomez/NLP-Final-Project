Some demonstrators proceeded to vandalize and loot the homes of staff and the ambassador's residence, destroy furniture, steal their property and set fire to the main embassy office building, Hague said.
"This is a breach of international responsibilities of which any nation should be ashamed," Hague said.
Alistair Burt, British under-secretary of state at the Foreign Office, also accused Iran's government of being involved in the embassy incident on Wednesday, calling it a deliberate provocation.
The attacks happened in "two separate places, simultaneously," Burt said.
Norway is closing its embassy there temporarily "because of a general assessment of the security situation in Iran," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hilde Steinfeld said earlier Wednesday.
"The gathering of the Iranian people in front of the British embassy was a reflection of the nation's public opinion caused by British actions," he said, according to the website.
"A number of" protesters who broke into both places have been arrested, IRNA said, quoting the nation's deputy commander of security forces.
"The failure of the Iranian government to defend British staff and property was a disgrace," the prime minister said.
The move came after an International Atomic Energy Agency report highlighted new concerns about "the possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program," the British Treasury statement said last week.
