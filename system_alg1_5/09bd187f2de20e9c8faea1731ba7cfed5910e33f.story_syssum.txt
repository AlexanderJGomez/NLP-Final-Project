6, the officials said.
Officials with Tokyo Electric Power Company, which runs the plant, proposed the release of excess water that has pooled in and around the Nos.
5 and 6 is coming from a subdrain and wasn't inside the building itself, officials said.
Water is about 8.5 pounds per gallon, so one ton is about 260 gallons," said Gary Was, a professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Michigan.
It could take 50 hours to dump all the water, Tokyo Electric said.
The build-up of water could cause problems around the nuclear facility, which is 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo, Edano said Monday.
2 reactor, and we know this.
"I am not able to say for certain whether or not this will be the last discharge, but we certainly would like to avoid releasing any such water into the sea as much as possible," agency spokesman Hidehiko Nishiyama said.
"We don't know clearly, but we feel it is somehow leaking from Unit 2," Nishiyama said.
Reactors No.
3, which have lower levels of water, need to be drained as well.
After some high-profile errors, little new information on water, ground and air radiation has been released since Thursday.
But it may not be the most difficult, or important, task ahead.
"We were assuming and hoping (that water) would stay in the containment vessel as vapor after being cooled," Nishiyama, the nuclear safety official, said Sunday.
This makes it imperative to pump out that water, which will end up into the sea like that from around the Nos.
"Though those reactors are stable at the moment, the growing water level in the turbine houses may disturb their stability," he said.
On Monday, Edano said these limits would not change, even as he outlined a process in which sales restrictions on certain crops, in certain areas, would be lifted if they test safe three times in a row.
