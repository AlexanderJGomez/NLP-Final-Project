The judge in the case asked Hasan if he had removed Galligan voluntarily and without outside pressure, and Hasan said, "Yes."
Hasan, an Army psychiatrist of Muslim background, is accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32 others in November 2009.
As such, I deeply regret that my presence on the Defense Team has been interrupted.
He was only released and he may be back, he said.
Hasan did not have the option of pleading guilty.
He appeared alert during the proceeding, speaking frequently to Poppe.
Aside from protecting Hasan's rights, Galligan has fought to get him proper medical treatment while he awaits trial.
He took it off during the hearing and put it back on just before wheeling himself out of the courtroom.
