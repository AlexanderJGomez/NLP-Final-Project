The kidnapping serves Shekau on many levels, and observers of Boko Haram say he should not be underestimated.
As deputy to former Boko Haram leader Mohamed Yusuf, who was killed in 2009, Shekau delivered sermons littered with references to Islamic scholars.
"He kills anyone who challenges him, but to blow him off as a madman would be to underestimate his capabilities," says Zenn.
"Western education" is a prime target of Boko Haram because in the group's view, it reinforces colonial and Christian influence and suppresses Islam.
Shehu Sani, a human rights activist in northern Nigeria who has previously been involved in mediating with Boko Haram, believes the abduction and other recent attacks are messages to the Nigerian government that the recent arrest of Boko Haram followers in Islamic schools will be avenged.
"Every time people have started talking about the decline of Boko Haram, it has emerged as deadlier and more fierce," Sani told CNN.
In his video, Shekau said of the girls: "We would also give their hands in marriage because they are our slaves."
"Women must go and marry," he said in the video statement.
"Boko Haram has likely split up or sold the girls into many small groups," and they can be used as human shields in the event of an attack, he said.
Sani believes Boko Haram targeted the girls to force concessions from the Nigerian government -- beginning perhaps with the release of Boko Haram followers from prisons.
"People don't buy girls in this part Africa," he said.
"He doesn't care at all about international opinion but he knows it has put pressure on the government to reach out to him," Sani said.
Sani says the stakes could not be higher for the region.
