Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- We had not been in Port-au-Prince in a month, not since those horrible days following the earthquake when the city looked like wreckage.
Ariana Manassero, 17, raced into the main room of her home following the tremor.
Daphne, 4, clung to Ariana, shaking, acting out, sobbing for no good reason.
All day, staff members of Maison surveyed the damage to their community.
In one alley, a father bundled a newborn with whatever he could find.
In another, a dog cuddled her new puppies.
A woman who had attended the services had died after the aftershock, her heart suddenly seizing.
No immediate reports of damage were made, but the aftershock sent frightened people once again out into the bug-filled night.
In the food line, the crowd was so quiet for people who looked hungry and faced a long wait.
Not much to say when a step forward is followed by a big leap back.
