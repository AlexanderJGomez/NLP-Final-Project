"Today's ruling affirms that Texas' Women's Health Program has no obligation to fund organizations that promote abortion -- including Planned Parenthood," Perry said.
"The 5th Circuit's decision is a win for Texas women, our rule of law and our state's priority to protect life."
Planned Parenthood sued Texas, winning an injunction against the law by arguing that abortion is constitutional and Texas' efforts would block women's access to preventive health care.
"Texas will continue providing important health services for women through this program in spite of the Obama administration's disregard for our state law and unilateral decision to defund this program," he said.
In Texas, Planned Parenthood has been the Women's Health Program's largest provider, serving about 40% of patients.
But under the Texas program, neither the agency nor its affiliates perform the procedure.
Texas also slashed funding for family planning clinics.
