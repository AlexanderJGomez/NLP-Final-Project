Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a leader of the GOP tea party wing, mounted a filibuster attempt to force a 60-vote threshold for proceeding on the debt ceiling measure.
"We got a good outcome," said GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, one of the 12 who helped defeat the filibuster but then opposed the measure on the final vote.
Cruz, however, was unapologetic.
Meanwhile, 193 Democrats backed the measure with only two voting "no."
Some conservatives oppose raising the debt ceiling under any circumstance, while Democrats had made it clear they would unanimously reject any measure that tacked other provisions onto an increase in the borrowing limit.
On Wednesday, the Senate also passed the military pension measure after the votes on the debt ceiling legislation.
"And so, let his party give him the debt ceiling increase that he wants."
A recent CNN/ORC International poll found that 54% of respondents would blame congressional Republicans for a failure to raise the debt ceiling, while 29% would blame Obama and 12% would blame both.
