Ihsanullah Ihsan, the spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, said the militant group would conduct various attacks in India in response to the execution.
India has requested extra protection for its diplomats in Pakistan following the execution, said J.P. Singh, an official at India's Ministry of External Affairs.
India blamed Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, a Pakistani-based terror group allied with al Qaeda, for the Mumbai siege.
Indian authorities said Kasab was trained by the organization, which was banned in Pakistan in 2002 after an attack on the Indian parliament.
It was the first visit to India by a Pakistani head of state in seven years.
"It's a strong message that India does not and will not tolerate terrorism," said Prakash Javadekar, a party spokesman.
"The hanging of Ajmal Kasab marks a distressing end to India's moratorium on executions and is a step backwards for India's justice system," said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch, an advocacy group.
