(CNN) -- China's foreign minister pushed Friday for the lifting of sanctions against Zimbabwe, saying no country has a right to dictate the internal affairs of another nation, state-run media reported.
"The Western countries have imposed sanctions on us for taking our land, although we had discussed this in 1979," he said.
"That is what started the problem."
Mugabe said last December that he was tired of working with the opposition party, which he said "lacked ideology and policies."
Despite isolation from the West, Mugabe's supporters include his Iranian counterpart Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
