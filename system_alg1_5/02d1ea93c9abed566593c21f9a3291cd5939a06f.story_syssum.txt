However, she was transferred Tuesday to an undisclosed location in the United States, according to Michelle Simard, spokeswoman for Hopital du Sacre-Coeur.
At the time, Richardson was accompanied by a veteran female ski instructor, who called the ski patrol, the statement said.
Accompanied by the instructor, Richardson went to her hotel, where she was again advised to see a doctor, the resort said.
The Montreal Gazette reported that Richardson's two sons with Neeson were skiing with her at the time of her fall, and that Neeson flew to Montreal from a Toronto film set to be with her at the hospital.
