Chavarria, 21, of Eugene, Oregon, defeated two other players in a single-elimination tournament during festivities surrounding Tuesday's MLB All-Star Game in New York City.
His basic strategy, he said, was to use "the best (available) pitcher against the worst team."
Chavarria, who was a pitcher in high school and for one year in college, said having a pitcher's mentality helped him devise a game plan against the batters.
"It is a video game, so you don't have to be a star athlete or a pitcher in the MLB.
That was a lot of pressure gone and I didn't have to worry about it as much (after that)," he said.
Chavarria added another home run later in the game, and his pitching kept Holland's A's off balance as he won 3-1.
You just never know."
