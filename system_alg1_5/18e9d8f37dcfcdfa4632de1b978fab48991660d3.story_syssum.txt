Of course.
Unthinkable.
Shot by Luke Duggleby, who traveled to Thailand, Laos and Vietnam for the story, they're well worth your attention.
"The dogs are illegally smuggled out of Thailand -- that is the illegal part," he said.
In a slaughterhouse, "the dogs were beaten to death in front of me," he said.
That shouldn't.
"[U]nlike all farmed meat, which requires the creation and maintenance of animals, dogs are practically begging to be eaten," Jonathan Safran Foer, a vegetarian and novelist, writes in the book "Eating Animals."
True, in America.
"If you befriend it, it's a friend.
If you raise it for food, it's food," he says in a 2002 essay, hilariously titled "Wok the Dog."
That's the case for me.
I didn't.
If we think dog shouldn't be eaten -- like, ever, regardless of how clean the trade is and how quick the kill -- then maybe we should think about the other animals we eat, and if and why we don't feel the same way about them.
For his part, Duggleby, the photographer who shot the dog story, told me he was offered dog meat on the assignment but couldn't eat it.
That's a harder question.
