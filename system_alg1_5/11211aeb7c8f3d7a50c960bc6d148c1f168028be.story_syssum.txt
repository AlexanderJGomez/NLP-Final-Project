"There was no miracle.
They were not hysterical, and there was no stampeding.
The result in the A320 is the product of a genius -- an airplane that is ... exquisitely wrought, a delight to handle, and extraordinarily easy to fly."
Sullenberger, for his part, has been critical of Langewiesche's book, saying it makes too much of the aircraft's automation.
William Langewiesche: I realized that because this airplane is the A320, which is a revolutionary plane, not just any airplane, the story of the A320 is in many ways the story of the modern airline industry of the last 20, 30 or 40 years.
The airplane was very controversial in the early 1980s, especially in France.
The airplane will take over, and it will override the pilot, and philosophically that's a really provocative thing to do.
... Also the landing gear was up.
Langewiesche: Of course, it's justified.
Obviously, calling it a miracle is silly.
And with deregulation, the salary of the pilot had been downsized.
It's technically possible, and the U.S. flies drones in Afghanistan ... but obviously that's not the future of airlines in a dense traffic world with the public aboard.
Langewiesche: Pilots, of course, are central.
Without the pilot, forget about it.
Langewiesche: This thing we hear so repetitively -- it's actually the safety briefing on a plane, which is probably a pretty good guide to it.
And by the way, airline accidents are very, very rare.
Clearly, they were flying a fly-by-wire airplane, and that's part of the story.
I never imply that, had they been flying a 737, things would have been worse.
