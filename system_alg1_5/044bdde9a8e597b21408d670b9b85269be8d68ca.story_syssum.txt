Sharapova, whose victory margin was identical to her only previous meeting with Errani, who she beat in the final of this year's French Open, was delighted to make an impact at the WTA Championships after injury forced her early withdrawal last year.
"This is such a great feeling, not only to make it here but to feel good physically," the World No.2 told the WTA's official website.
The victory, which quickly reached its conclusion once Williams broke for 3-1 in the second set, was greeted with huge enthusiasm by those watching inside Istanbul's Sinan Erdem Dome.
"It's challenging, definitely, but I'm looking forward to it."
