In a separate statement, Boeing said it was working with the FAA, the National Transportation Safety Board and Southwest, and it was preparing a service bulletin to recommend lap joint inspections on certain 737 models.
"As the details of this unusual incident unfold, we will get a better understanding of what caused the plane's fuselage to tear open," said Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-West Virginia.
Southwest said 64 of the 737-300s were being returned to service, while inspectors had discovered subsurface cracks on three jets.
As planes are cleared, they will be put back into service, Southwest said.
"We were in shock," passenger Debbie Downey said Saturday.
"Most people were just white knuckles, holding on to the arm rests," he said.
The plane's flight data recorders had no noteworthy information on them, Sumwalt said.
