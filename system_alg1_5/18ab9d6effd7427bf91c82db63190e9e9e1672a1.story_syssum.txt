All 114 people arrested at the protest against mountain-top mining were later released pending a court date, according to the park service.
"The science is clear, mountaintop removal destroys historic mountain ranges, poisons water supplies and pollutes the air with coal and rock dust," said climate scientist James Hansen, who was arrested at the White House.
"I have talked, begged, debated, written letters to officials, published op-ed pieces in newspapers and lobbied on the state and federal level to end mountaintop removal," said Mickey McCoy, former mayor of Inez, Kentucky, who was also arrested.
The resulting degradation of the environment affects water sources such as streams, as well as animal and plant life in the area.
