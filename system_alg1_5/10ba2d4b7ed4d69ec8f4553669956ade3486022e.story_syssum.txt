A new Field Poll, released at the end of February, provides the evidence of what many of us here on the left coast have been sensing over the last 4Â½ years: When it comes to same-sex marriage, many California voters want a do-over.
I went through it myself.
California's struggle started about the same time.
Note that this is the same percentage that, in the current Field Poll, says they now support same-sex marriage.
California voters approved the measure, 52% to 48% -- and in doing so, betrayed their own liberal reputation.
I live in California, and so I saw it all play out.
Those are the facts.
And it happened here, across the board.
In the poll, 57% of Americans now say that they have a family member or close friend who is gay or lesbian.
Whatever is causing the shift, in California and throughout the United States, let's be thankful for it.
Because, closer to home, many Californians have already admitted their mistake.
