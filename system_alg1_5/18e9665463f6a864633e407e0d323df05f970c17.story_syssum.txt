Previously, nine had been reported killed.
The militants are Sunnis who sympathize with ISIS extremists, who have been waging attacks inside neighboring Syria and, beyond that, in parts of Iraq, according to Lebanese media reports.
Fighting continues in the nearby Al Muhammara area and the Sunni neighborhood of Bab al-Tabbaneh, security officials said.
In a statement run on the website of An Nahar, the most respected local paper, Prime Minister Tammam Salam, a Sunni, condemned the attacks on the army, as has one of his most important predecessors, Saad Hariri.
