Even the most sprawling modern-day gaming experiences, such as "World of Warcraft" and "Call of Duty: Black Ops," still bow to the classic game design principle of keeping play easy to learn but hard to master.
There's a reason why social games, including "FarmVille" and "Mafia Wars," and iPhone apps such as "Angry Birds" and "Pocket God" continue to rack up millions of plays.
Games in role-playing, simulation and strategy genres also thrive by adding greater intricacy, not less.
In short, we'd weep for a world without the latest "Civilization" or "Gran Turismo."
But even in the era of sprawling odysseys like "Alan Wake" and "Red Dead Redemption," they remain secondary to a fun, engaging and approachable core game experience.
