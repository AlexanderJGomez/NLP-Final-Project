Reyhanli, Turkey (CNN) -- Protesters in a Turkish border town hit by a twin car-bombing a week ago clashed with police Saturday, as they voiced anger over the government's response to the attack.
The police have not yet commented on the clashes, which quietened down after less than an hour.
Her brother, Halim Calim, said, "We are here to voice our pain."
All 21 suspects are Turkish nationals, he said.
Interior Minister Muammer Guler and other Turkish officials have accused a former Marxist terror group that they say maintains relations with Al Muhabarat, Syria's intelligence services, according to Anadolu.
