(CNN) -- A grand jury has brought felony charges against three Dallas, Texas, police officers who were caught on patrol car dashboard cameras beating a motorcyclist after a chase, prosecutors said Thursday.
An internal investigation found that Bauer and Randolph disregarded an order to stop the chase, with one of the officers saying, "Keep us going.
Collins eventually stopped, and when the officers spotted him, Bauer struck the bike with his patrol car.
He initially was charged with three traffic warrants, evading arrest, resisting arrest, and possession of marijuana after his arrest.
