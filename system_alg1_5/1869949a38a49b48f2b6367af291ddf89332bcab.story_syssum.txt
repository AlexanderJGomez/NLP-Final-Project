Costilla, nicknamed "El Coss," was captured without a fight in the coastal city of Tampico, in the border state of Tamaulipas, Navy spokesman Jose Luis Vergara said Thursday.
Five others were arrested with Costilla, and of five of his bodyguards were arrested after a shootout in a separate city, Vergara said.
In that incident, according to the U.S. State Department, Costilla and other suspected Gulf Cartel leaders allegedly stopped federal agents and pointed AK-47 rifles at them.
As Costilla rose in the cartel hierarchy, the group controlled smuggling routes in northeastern Mexico by using its enforcement arm, known as Los Zetas, authorities have said.
Costilla's arrest was the result of "intense intelligence" work by the Navy, and information gleaned from Mario Cardenas' arrest, Vergara said.
The other big winner is the Mexican Navy and its marines, who again proved they are effective at going after high-profile targets, he said.
But the arrest of Costilla was a "Mexican operation," said the U.S. drug agency's spokesman, Rusty Payne.
