Vick was released from a federal prison in Leavenworth, Kansas, on Wednesday.
Vick is a native of Newport News, Virginia.
The original plan called for Vick to come up with $750,000 to $1 million in cash to be paid to creditors, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Frank Santoro said, but he said he saw no evidence Vick could come up with that much.
After his release, Vick will work with the Humane Society of the United States on anti-dogfighting campaigns, Humane Society President Wayne Pacelle told CNN Tuesday.
More attention has been paid to dogfighting as a result of Vick's case, Pacelle said.
The Humane Society, which offers rewards for tips involving dogfighting, has recently paid out $40,000 in five cases, he said.
