It was something out of a horror movie," she said.
"I thought I was going to die," Traylor said.
"I thought Lorenzo was dead already," Traylor said.
LaShawn Traylor says, "a nurse told me she didn't think I was going to make it."
She approached me and said, "I don't know where my baby is.
I didn't want to leave the city without knowing where my baby was; I just thought that was weird," Traylor said.
"I thought Lorenzo was with her and when I first saw her she told me 'I don't know where the baby is' and that's when my heart sank," said Lionel Traylor.
The family tried to return to New Orleans, the city both LaShawn and Lionel Traylor had always called home.
In Jackson, Mississippi, the Traylor family is flourishing.
"Life is better now," says LaShawn Traylor.
