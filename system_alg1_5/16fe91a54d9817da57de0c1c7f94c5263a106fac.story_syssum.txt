A significant storm will threaten the Northeast on Monday into Tuesday, and areas of Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota could see blizzard conditions through the night.
This will keep overall snow totals down, but traveling will still be difficult," meteorologist J.C. Monahan said.
A tornado touched down Monday afternoon in Rutherford County near Nashville, Tennessee, county officials said.
The warning said there were areas where visibility was almost zero because of blowing snow, and there was significant ice on the highways and streets.
One highway was blocked because of snow drifts covering the road, CNN affiliate KXJB reported.
