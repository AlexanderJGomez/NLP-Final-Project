This year it's 2,181.
There are more than 250 garage-size shelters "roughly a day's hike apart" along the length of the Appalachian Trail, according to Brian King of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, the nonprofit corporation that leads efforts to maintain the trail.
That's good, because that "day's hike" can be up to 30 miles, since shelters are built near sources of fresh water, King said.
In the case of bears, wild pigs, raccoons and snakes, that's good.
1 rule of the Appalachian Trail: Leave no trace.
It's hard.
Literally.
It's a good idea to stow anything breakable, like a smartphone, at the top or to the back of your pack to keep it from breaking when you fall on your rear end.
After some distance, each step is painful.
The numbers are derived from sign-in sheets at either end of the trail and at conservancy headquarters at the unofficial midway point in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, as well as from "ridge runners," who keep an eye on logbooks at shelters in their area.
Those who have hiked the Appalachian Trail "know they've done it," King said.
The trail is maintained by volunteers.
Anne Sharp, aka "Margolo," and Travis Olson, aka "Chaco Taco," are thru-hiking with Willett, a German shepherd, unofficially aka "Dog Quixote" (he occasionally chases imaginary threats in the woods, Sharp said).
Follow "Margolo," "Chaco Taco" and Willett's thru hike.
"Oh, good, more rocks."
Oh, good, more rocks.
We had just come back from a 6-mile round-trip excursion into town to buy, um, supplies.
Most shelters have privies.
The dirt, called "duff," is the layer of soil and mold just beneath the layer of leaves on the forest floor.
