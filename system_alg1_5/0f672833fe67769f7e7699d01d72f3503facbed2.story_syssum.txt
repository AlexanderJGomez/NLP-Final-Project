McKay Hatch, 16, launched an initiative to curb the use of profanity.
McKay Hatch: Actually, when I first went to my parents about the idea, my dad was kind of like, 'No, no, don't do this.'
Nicole Lapin: Well, you received not only death threats we should say, McKay.
Hatch: It's definitely worth it.
That's what this whole club is.
Hatch: Yeah, it's about talking to people with civility like you said, and making people feel good about themselves and talking to people with respect.
