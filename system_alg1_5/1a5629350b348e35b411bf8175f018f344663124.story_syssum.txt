But 2014 could hold particular resonance for him, as three of the season's four majors are at venues where he has won before.
"I view it as every year's a big year," 38-year-old Woods told a press conference.
That performance was enough to see Woods crowned the Tour's 2013 Player of the Year, even though he failed to seriously threaten any major titles -- tied fourth his best showing at the Masters.
He's triumphed four times at Augusta, scene of the year's first major -- The Masters -- and finished both second and third at Pinehurst, scene of this season's U.S. Open.
The British Open returns to Royal Liverpool -- where Woods won in 2006 -- before the final major of the season, the PGA Championship, is staged at Valhalla in Kentucky, where Woods took the title in 2000.
You evolve as you age and I think I've done that so far."
