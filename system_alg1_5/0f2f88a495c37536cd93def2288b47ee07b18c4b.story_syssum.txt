Dozens of supporters attended Dotcom's court hearings in New Zealand this week.
Dotcom holds one German passport, under the name of Kim Schmitz, and two Finnish passports, under the names of Kim Tim Jim Vestor and Kim Dotcom.
Dotcom is a resident of New Zealand, where he employs more than 50 staff, and Hong Kong, where he has a suite at the Grand Hyatt Hotel.
His lawyer, Paul Davison, argued the facts demonstrate his commitment to staying in New Zealand, where he obtained residency status in December 2009.
The New Zealand police used helicopters to storm Dotcom's mansion.
All reasons, his lawyers said, for not keeping him in custody.
