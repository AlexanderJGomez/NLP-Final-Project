(CNN) -- Countries rarely default, at least not under the basic understanding of the term.
They choose to stop paying, one way or another.

In Russia's case, it was able to pay back creditors within a few years, thanks to the rise of energy prices.
They want their money back.
Then, however, "the creditors pile in."
New creditors stepped in, instead of walking away.
Look at Cyprus.
If not, that would be a default.
