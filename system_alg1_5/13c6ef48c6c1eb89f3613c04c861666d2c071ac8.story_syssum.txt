Japan is in the midst of an unprecedented recession, so corporations are being asked to work toward fixing another major problem: the country's low birthrate.
At 1.34, the birthrate is well below the 2.0 needed to maintain Japan's population, according to the country's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.
In addition, Japan's population is aging at a faster pace than any other country in the world.
"It's great that we can go home early and not feel ashamed," said employee Miwa Iwasaki.
