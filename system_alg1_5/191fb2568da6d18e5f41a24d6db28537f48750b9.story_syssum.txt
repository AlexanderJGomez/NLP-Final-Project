Or a gas leak.
So if September 11, 2001, was the day our innocence was taken, then April 15, 2013, is the reminder that it is never coming back.
We do not need the president to say the word to feel it.
We don't need the president to say the word to be reminded constantly that if we see something, we need to say something, blurring the lines between a healthy awareness of our surroundings and irrational paranoia.
We will never, ever be safe again.
And make no mistake, while the president did not use that word in his news conference, that is the word federal authorities are using.
That peace is gone, forever.
Nothing will be the same.
