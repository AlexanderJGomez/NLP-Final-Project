A spokesman for the Plateau state government, Machias Abraham Yiljab, said three bodies were at the scene of the explosion.
After the explosion, youths took over a roadblock on the street leading to the church, and an agitated crowd of residents upset with the violence gathered nearby to talk with Jang.
On February 26, a car packed with explosives rammed into the compound of the Cocin (Church of Christ) headquarters, killing three people.
In a statement issued by his spokesman, Jonathan urged residents to refrain from reprisal attacks.
