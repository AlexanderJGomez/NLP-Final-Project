"Until now, a comparison of the girl's profile against Interpol's global DNA database has not produced a match," Interpol said in a news release.
"They include children from the United States, Canada, Poland and France," said Panagiotis Pardalis of the Smile of the Child charity.
The Smile of the Child said the girl, who was found Thursday in a Roma community near Larissa, central Greece, is being cared for in a group home.
The girl received the document this year, it said.
"There is no such thing as a tip too small," said Bradley, whose hopes were raised despite the apparent disparity in age between their missing daughter and Maria.
But again we want to confirm one way or the other," Robert Lowery, the senior executive director of the organization's missing children division, said.
Once that number has been narrowed, police will contact local authorities to assist, "if needed," she said.
"I used to see the mother, she would come to the square here to beg with the child," a man in the Larissa region told the Reuters news agency.
Prejudice and discrimination against the Roma are widespread in Greece and elsewhere in Europe, Amnesty International says.
