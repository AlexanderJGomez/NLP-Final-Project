Maathai, 71, died last month after a battle with cancer.
In true fashion to her cause, Maathai stated in her will that she did not want a wooden coffin, organizers said.
For decades, Maathai has been at the forefront of a tree-planting campaign to stop deforestation and give locals, especially women, access to resources such as firewood for cooking and clean water.
During her activism work, she was beaten and arrested numerous times, especially during the former regime of President Daniel arap Moi.
On Friday, the Nobel Committee awarded the peace prize to three women activists: Liberians Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the first African woman elected head of state and Leymah Gbowee, who campaigned for peace during the nation's brutal civil war and anti-government protester Tawakkul Karman of Yemen.
