But we have a global sanitation crisis.
In Tanzania, for example, half the country's citizens have mobile phones, but only 24% use an improved sanitation facility.
A small but dedicated community that includes governments, NGOs, donors and research institutions is working to expand access to basic sanitation services in developing countries.
In addition, some on-site sanitation facilities allow for the possibility of generating biogas for cooking and lighting, and for re-using composted excreta as fertilizer for agriculture.
In order to turn the tide on the global sanitation crisis, however, efforts are also needed to develop models for low- and no-water sanitation systems at scale, models to which municipal and national governments themselves can aspire.
Municipalities with limited resources struggle to regulate, much less manage, the emptying and safe disposal of sludge from these facilities.
Indeed, the recycling of grey water, even for nonpotable uses such as watering landscapes, is still controversial in many places.
We need to trigger sanitation innovations that can benefit citizens of wealthy and poor countries, and also instigate systems that help protect the resource base they depend on for development.
