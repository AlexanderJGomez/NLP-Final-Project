LONDON, England (CNN) -- "I'm having a vision of the near future.
These words from well-known music artists' rights advocate, educator and industry commentator, Moses Avalon, illustrate the degree to which the music industry is in rapid change.
MySpace Music will allow users to listen to any song from the catalogs of the music giants for free.
"I don't think it's going to have an impact on album sales or how many singles are sold," he said.
Avalon, however, told CNN he was optimistic about its chances.
It gives them an important piece of leverage over iTunes," he said.
Not for a second, said Avalon.
But, if you are talking about someone who wants a worldwide hit or to sell a million or more CDs there's still no way to do that other than through a major record label," Avalon said.
Now there's a big, long gray area."
Lefsetz disagrees, saying that the industry needs to either legitimize file-sharing or create something "just as good" that is also cheap.
It's not going to be a corporation, it will be an entrepreneur," he said.
Dubber, meanwhile, is not convinced that the music industry will find a new model.
And Avalon's answer: surely not.
