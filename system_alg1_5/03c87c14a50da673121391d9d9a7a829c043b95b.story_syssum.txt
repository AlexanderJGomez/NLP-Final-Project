Bamako, Mali (CNN) -- Mali's historic cultural center, Timbuktu, lacks electricity, water and phone service, because "terrorists" sabotaged the utilities there, a Paris-based spokesman for the ethnic Toureg separatist party MNLA said Thursday.
"Territorial integrity of Mali is nonnegotiable.
But, it also appears that Mali has asked for, and will need, some help to establish government control in the north," Ham said.
Mali's military offensive against the militants has gathered pace in the past two weeks, with backing from France and other international allies.
"In Sevare, at least 11 individuals were executed in the military camp, near the bus station and near the hospital," the FIDH said.
"This series of grave abuses confirms the concerns that we have been expressing for several weeks," said the group's president, Souhayr Belhassent.
"[It] should be a wake-up call not only to the Malian army to nip this problem in the bud and investigate and hold those responsible, but also to Mali's international partners -- the French, the European Union, the African forces who are coming in -- to acknowledge the weaknesses and problems within the Malian security forces, and then, to properly accompany them, to urgently train them in international humanitarian law and to mentor them so there are no further abuses in the future," Dufka said.
It has encountered widespread hatred of the Tuareg in Mali, with many in the population blaming them for bringing the current conflict into Mali.
France's involvement in Mali began the day after militants said January 10 that they had seized the city of Konna, east of Diabaly in central Mali, and were poised to advance south toward Bamako.
