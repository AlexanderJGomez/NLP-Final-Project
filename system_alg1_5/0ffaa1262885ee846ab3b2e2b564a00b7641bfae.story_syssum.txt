(CNN) -- Divers have found what they believe are human remains on the wrecked Costa Concordia cruise ship, the Italian Civil Protection agency announced Tuesday.
Rebello, 33, was a cruise waiter who was last seen helping passengers off the ship.
Before that, the ship rested 20 months on its side, hindering a full examination.
His defense is trying to prove, among other things, that the ship's watertight doors did not function properly, and that is the reason the ship sank, leading to all 32 deaths during evacuation.
