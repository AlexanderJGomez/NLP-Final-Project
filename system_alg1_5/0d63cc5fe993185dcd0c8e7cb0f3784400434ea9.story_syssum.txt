The man, Conrado Juarez, 52, is the girl's cousin.
Each year, on the anniversary of the July 23, 1991, discovery of her body, they would canvass nearby neighborhoods, handing out fliers and asking people for information.
It led detectives to Anjelica's sister, now an adult; from there, they identified the woman believed to be the girl's mother, he said.
Juarez admitted to the crime Saturday morning, Kelly said.
When the girl went motionless, Juarez told police, he summoned his sister from another room.
The sister, Balvena Juarez Ramirez, is deceased, Kelly said.
He said he was certain the killer was Anjelica's mother, father, or both.
From there, investigators constructed a family tree, and the trail led them to Juarez, Kelly said.
"They were unrelenting," he said.
