Cicciaro died that night, and White was arrested.
White, who is African-American, maintains he was protecting his family from a white lynch mob and says the gun discharged accidentally.
Aaron  White testified that after he left the party, Cicciaro and a male friend called him on his cell phone, saying to him, "Get back to this party you n****r."
Then, police say, John White shot Cicciaro at point-blank range.
Daniel Cicciaro's mother, Joanne Cicciaro, says her son was trying to protect the girl.
During the trial, which lasted three weeks and ended Tuesday,  John White broke down in tears.
"The Whites, none of them, ever called 9-1-1, even after he shot Daniel, but he did call their attorney," Joanne Cicciaro added.
I got to tell him that I loved him," Joanne Cicciaro said.
