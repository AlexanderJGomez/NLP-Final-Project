Chiranuch Premchaiporn was found guilty for allowing content prohibited under Thailand's controversial "lese-majeste" law to stay on Prachatai, an independent online news site, for 20 days before it was deleted.
She could have faced 20 years in jail.
"Thailand's lese-majeste laws are being overused and abused," said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at HRW.
Various banners condemning lese-majeste, or Section 112 of the Criminal Code, were also flown.
