BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- The U.S. military said disturbing video that shows masked boys brandishing guns was an al Qaeda in Iraq training and recruiting tool.
Also in the video, armed boys in black hoods, with weapons pointed, shout and force a man off his bicycle, search a car, and clear a building while a male voice off camera instructs them.
In Baghdad on Wednesday, roadside bombings in south-central Iraq killed seven people and wounded nine others, Iraq's Interior Ministry said.
The four killed, two women, a child and a man, were civilian passers-by.
In eastern Baghdad, a third roadside bomb targeted a U.S. military patrol, the Interior Ministry said.
The Sons of Iraq, Concerned Local Citizens and Awakening Councils are the names of anti-al Qaeda in Iraq citizen groups that have emerged across the country in recent months.
The operations took place in the Baghdad area, in Mosul, and near Ramadi.
