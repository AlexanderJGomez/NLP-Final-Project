Its goal: To create a caliphate, or Islamic state, spanning Iraq and Syria.
That's not all.
While ISIS has controlled parts of Syria for some time now, the group was fighting to open a route between its  captures in Iraq and in Syria.
Days after their land grabs across Deir Ezzor province, ISIS militants have not let residents return to the towns of Khsham and Tabyeh, the SOHR said.
They had been told to "accept their repentance" after fighting ISIS, the SOHR said.
It announced that ISIS was changing its name to just the "Islamic State."
The demands come after ISIS made advances in Deir Ezzor and, more alarmingly, the suburbs of Aleppo -- Syria's largest city, Khatib said.
"In their statement, they predict that ISIS will take over all opposition territory in Syria unless decisive action is taken promptly."
