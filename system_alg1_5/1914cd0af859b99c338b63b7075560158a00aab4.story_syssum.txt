Musician Paul Simon, left, joins House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to oppose Bush's veto of the SCHIP bill.
Bush was "pleased," the statement said, that the "misguided legislation" was defeated.
It was the fourth veto of Bush's term.
"There will be no compromise on 10 million children's health care," Emanuel told CNN.
The bill the House and Senate passed in September would extend eligibility for the program to about 4 million more, paying for the expansion with a 61-cent-per-pack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes.
"I made clear that, if putting poor children first requires more than the 20 percent increase in funding I proposed, we'll work with Congress to find the money we need," said the president.
But they just ran the bill, and I made it clear we weren't going to accept it."
Meanwhile, of the eight Democrats who voted against the bill in September, only one has said he will reverse his vote and support an override.
Democratic Rep. Diane Watson of California, who declined to vote on the original bill, has agreed to vote for the override, House Democratic Whip Rep. Jim Clyburn said.
