I mean, I got evicted, so it's kind of a bummer.
McGuire: No, I can't blame them.
EW: Yeah, it's true.
McGuire: No, actually.
McGuire: Yes.
McGuire: I don't know.
McGuire: Ah no.
I mean, I would've used it on myself, so I told her to use it on herself.
But I know who I am, and I know that no matter what anybody says, it's not going to change my feelings about myself.
McGuire: Yeah, I'm not racist, sexist, or homophobic, so I mean, I guess everything can be taken out of context.
McGuire: I mean, it was crazy, don't get me wrong.
McGuire: Yeah, yeah.
But hopefully, she reacts well.
McGuire: Yeah, I'm going back to the boat.
I don't know 'bout all that, but we'll see.
She might not anymore, but she did.
EW: That's humility.
EW: Yeah.
Thank you.
