Dakar, Senegal (CNN) -- A colorful platter steams with heat, rising from seasoned fish and an assortment of fresh vegetables all on a plush bed of rice.
Yellow, red, green, white, all dance along the hull in bold fashion revealing a variety of circular designs.
In fact, as I watch with confusion at the apparent chaos around me, a methodical process emerges.
As I snap pictures of the frenetic scene around me a woman approaches, holds up her hands, reaches for my camera and wags her finger.
The key is to only use the best, freshest vegetables; because they will become a stuffing for the fish.
I mash, push, pound and pulverize for 30 minutes, breaking a sweat.
The mashed vegetables are slimy in my hand, a testament to my good work, I think.
This is a culture that begs for closer inspection, something that reveals strong family bonds, a stubbornness for good quality and vibrant, tasty cuisine.
