What's more, Albert Einstein was born on this day.
What's more, its digits go on infinitely, without any pattern in the numbers.
Math may be scary, but pi is not -- as evidenced by the widespread revelry on Pi Day.
"And so Pi Day is an acquired taste," mathematician Jonathan Borwein, at the University of Newcastle in Australia, said in an e-mail.
If you want to go where the day is said to be "invented," look no further than San Francisco's Exploratorium.
For those who can't attend in person, the Exploratorium has a Second Life Pi Day event that includes "irrational exhibits, fireworks, cheerleaders, music, and dancing."
The "brainiac town" residents "love this event because it's a way for them to celebrate how quirky they are," said Mimi Omiecinski, owner of the Princeton Tour Company, who started Princeton Pi Day in 2009.
Last year about 9,000 people participated, she said.
Even the Salvador Dali Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, will celebrate the day, as "Dali loved the irrational numbers Pi and Phi, often using them and other mathematical principles in his art," according to the museum.
David Blatner, author of the comprehensive book "The Joy of Pi," is hosting a Pi Day competition in which students from three classrooms will square off to see who can recite the most digits of pi from memory.
That's because pi to four digits after the decimal is 3.1415, and we're unlikely to survive until 2115 to see that second instance of pi perfection.
