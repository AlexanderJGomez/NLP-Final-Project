Mao Zedong proclaims the founding of the People's Republic of China in Beijing on October 1, 1949.
Behind it lies the Imperial Palace, or Forbidden City, where China's Emperors used to live.
In Mao's ideology, the Chinese people found hope in a New China, wherein citizens would always have a bowl of rice to eat and clothes to wear.
In the late 1960s, Mao would again stand in the Tiananmen rostrum to launch the Cultural Revolution.
For ten years, China was condemned to political turmoil and economic malaise.
In 1972, the People's Republic of China replaced the Republic of China (Taiwan) in the United Nations.
His quest for stability and prosperity took off in the early 1990s, propelled by his pragmatic policies to entice foreign investments and build China's private sector.
In the early 1980s, the first Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet opened in Beijing, just a stone's throw away from Mao's mausoleum.
The backlash came to a boil in 1989, when Tiananmen witnessed an outpouring of support for the students who called for freedom and democracy, and more reform.
The People's Liberation Army, no longer a "junkyard army," has emerged as a formidable military power capable of launching a human being into space and shooting down satellites.

"To build a well-off society for 1.3 billion people and a democratic, civilized, harmonious and modernized country," he recently told a communist party meeting, "China must firmly push reform and opening up and stick to its own path."
