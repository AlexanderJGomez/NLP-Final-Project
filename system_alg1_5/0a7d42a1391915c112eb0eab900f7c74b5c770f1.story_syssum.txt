Since then, I've covered Lollapalooza, Pitchfork Music Festival, moe.down and other summer festivals, acquiring along the way a checklist of sorts that I wish I'd had before embarking on that first one.
1.
2.
3.
Bring the usual camping gear -- tent, sleeping bag, etc.
If you're attending a festival located in a city or metropolitan area, such as Pitchfork in Chicago, getting a hotel room for the weekend on your own is an option, or you can take advantage of the festival's package lodging deals.
As more and more festivals incorporate different genres, I've seen an increasingly diverse cross-section of fans at festivals.
I don't include this tip to be a killjoy, but only as a word of caution.
I can't stress this enough: however you do it, whether it's reading a book, taking a nap, or journaling in a quiet spot, make time to give your ears and other senses a rest.
