On this day, the deafening cheers were not for presidential hopeful Mir Hossein Mousavi, but rather for his wife -- a woman some are calling Iran's Michelle Obama.
Wherever Mousavi -- a centrist candidate -- goes, Rahnavard is usually nearby.
At this rally, Rahnavard -- a writer and art professor -- spoke for her husband, who was campaigning elsewhere.
"I am really angry here in Iran with the position of women," said Saghar Kouhestani, adding that she supports Mousavi because of his wife.
"If Ahmadinejad does well in the debates, I don't think anyone will be able to defeat him," Marandi said.
"This is the first time after the Revolution we see a lady behind the president," said Farhad Mahmoudi.
