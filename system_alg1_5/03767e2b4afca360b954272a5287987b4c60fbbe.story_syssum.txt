The son of Dominican immigrants who worked different jobs such as collecting garbage to help pay for college, Perez has dedicated himself to fulfilling the promise of equal opportunity for all, Obama told a White House ceremony to introduce Perez, 51.
"True progress is possible if you keep and open mind, listen to all sides and focus on results," Perez said.
In nominating Perez, Obama called on him to continue efforts by Solis and her team on helping returning war veterans get jobs, improving worker safety in coal mines and other steps to strengthen workers' rights.
Perez's nomination pleased unions and workers' rights groups, but rankled Senate conservatives due in part to his record at the Justice Department.
Perez, who has overseen the agency's civil rights division, has been active in several high-profile cases in recent years.
Though Perez had not yet been confirmed to oversee the civil rights division when the decision was made, he said in testimony to Inspector General Michael Horowitz in May 2010 that politics played no part in the decision.
Before rising to the Justice Department position, Perez led Maryland's Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation.
Perez also worked for the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, and spent the final two years of the Clinton administration as head of the Health and Human Services Department's civil rights office.
