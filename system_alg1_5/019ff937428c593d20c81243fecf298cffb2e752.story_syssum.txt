(CNN) -- It's an unreal scene, like one from a horror film.
â€¢ 6:38 p.m. Lockett is grimacing, grunting and lifting his head and shoulders entirely up from the gurney.
While the third was being administered, Lockett's vein "exploded," Oklahoma Department of Corrections Director Robert Patton told reporters.
For those people, perhaps, Oklahoma's botched execution will be a wake-up call -- a realization that all executions, regardless of method, are cruel and not especially unusual in parts of the United States.
It's unclear if public opinion in Oklahoma mirrors the national trend, statistically, but anecdotal evidence suggests the state supports, if not celebrates, state-sponsored death.
Not everyone reacted this way, to be sure.
It was Oklahoma, after all, in 1977, that was the first state to authorize death by lethal injection.
It rattled some feathers in Oklahoma, as there were protesters at the Capitol.
A political circus ensued, and the court, in the view of Andrew Cohen, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, "caved in to the political pressure."
As part of that, she should make the source of Oklahoma's drugs known.
"Reporters exchange shocked glances," she wrote at 6:39 p.m. "Nothing like this has happened at an execution any of us has witnessed since 1990, when the state resumed executions using lethal injection."
But it's got a cold grip on Oklahoma.
