For Lewis Pugh, it was a love of the environment and a passionate desire to save the Arctic from global warming.
In 2006, to raise awareness about global warming and that year's drought in England, Pugh swam the entire length of the River Thames -- all except the first 26 miles, which had already dried up.
The next year, Pugh became the first person to swim the 87 mile-width of the Maldives.
Pugh's long-time coach Professor Tim Noakes told CNN, "People usually drown very quickly on exposure to cold water because they start to hyperventilate and when you hyperventilate you can't coordinate.
Noakes recorded an increase in Pugh's body temperature and over the next fortnight, as Pugh was exposed to more cold-water swims, he was able to increase his temperature even further, peaking at 38.4 C.
Once he hits the water, it's all about mental strength.
I can hear the sounds of the engines, of Tim Noakes screaming at me.
I have swum the North Pole hundreds of times in my mind," he told CNN.
As Pugh put it after completing his Arctic swim, "I'm relieved that it's over.
