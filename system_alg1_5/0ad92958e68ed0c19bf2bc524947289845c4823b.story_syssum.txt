Felipe Massa receives attention after his high-speed crash in Hungarian Grand Prix qualifying.
"The condition of the driver is serious, but stable," said a hospital spokesman.
Button was only eighth fastest with  Brawn GP teammate Barrichello 13th best, their worst qualifying performance of the season.
"We will try to win, but being honest and realistic, our target is to get some good points," added the Spaniard.
