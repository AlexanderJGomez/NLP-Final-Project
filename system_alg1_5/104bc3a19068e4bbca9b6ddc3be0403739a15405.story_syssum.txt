Haiti's Minister of Civil Protection said Friday that the government estimates more than 50,000 people were killed, with the number possibly closer to 100,000.
Despite the death and destruction, hundreds of people, mostly women, took to the streets in an area of the capital on Friday, singing and chanting as they marched down the street -- a sign of resilience amid huge mounds of rubble.
Aid workers continued to trickle into the country Friday, trying to provide water and food to survivors in the capital, which still was being rocked by aftershocks Friday.
Elsewhere, a U.N. food convoy was rushed by dozens of hungry people who clamored to reach the handouts of nutritional biscuits and water-purification tablets.
President Obama spoke for about a half-hour with Preval on Friday, pledging the "full support of the American people," including long-term help.
But, Ban said, aid flights are arriving, and food and medical supplies are beginning to be distributed in Port-au-Prince.
U.N. entities in Haiti employ more than 12,000 people.
"If help doesn't come quickly, it probably will (get worse)," Agnes Pierre-Louis, manager of her family-owned hotel, the Le Plaza in downtown Port-au-Prince.
The priority now, he said, is cranking up rescue and relief efforts to stave off restiveness.
