The trigger came Friday, when a car bomb exploded in central Beirut, killing Lebanon's top intelligence official, Brig.
Many in Lebanon immediately suspected al-Assad's regime in the assassination.
And many observers believe that the longer Syria's conflict goes on, the more destabilizing it will be for Lebanon.
Speculation immediately fell to Syria, even though Damascus and its ally, Hezbollah, both condemned the attack.
Al-Hassan may have been targeted because he was leading an investigation into a Lebanese politician, Michel Samaha, who is accused of working with two Syrian officials to plan attacks inside Lebanon.
Elements of Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati's alliance are firm, if quiet, supporters of the al-Assad regime.
To the West, Hezbollah is an enemy.
But inside Lebanon, it runs hospitals and schools, provides college counseling and employs traffic cops.
Both countries have provided the group, which has a military wing, with financial backing and weapons for years.
After al-Hassan's funeral Sunday, angry protesters clashed with security forces and rushed toward Mikati's office in central Beirut, calling for his dismissal.
The major concern for Lebanon is that Syria's troubles will reopen the wounds of Lebanon's 15-year-long civil war, which ended in 1990.
The good news is that the war exhaustion factor is very high in Lebanon, Phillips explained.
"There's been an assumption for several years that the Lebanese people are fed up and exhausted with civil war," Phillips said.
