"This is unprecedented," said Jeff Ventura, communications director for the House's chief administrator.
"In a short period of time, lots of Web users were rushing to the digital doorway to get a copy of this thing," Ventura told CNN in a phone interview.
"This was a massive digital busy signal," he said.
"Because there were so many e-mails, it was impacting even the presentation of House.gov," he explained.
"We monitored the situation all night long, and technicians and engineers saw that we were facing the same demand as yesterday," Ventura said.
Ventura said the House.gov Web site experienced a very high number of hits when the 9/11 commission released its final report on the September 11, 2001, terror attacks against the United States, but nothing like what the site has seen in the past few days.
