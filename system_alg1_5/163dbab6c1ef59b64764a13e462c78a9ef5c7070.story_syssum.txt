The draw sees Milan stay in second spot, one point behind champions Inter, who were held to a 1-1 draw at Palermo on Saturday.
Napoli, who are still chasing a Champions League place, had chances to reclaim the lead and home keeper Abbiati had to show his mettle either side of the break.
If we do, the scudetto is a real possibility.
Juve, shocked by Fulham in the Europa League, were beaten by a superb long range strong from Antonio Cassano for Samp, who go fifth.
