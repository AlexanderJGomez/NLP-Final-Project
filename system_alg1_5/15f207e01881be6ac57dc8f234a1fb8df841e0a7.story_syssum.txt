(CNN) -- A federal judge ruled Wednesday that North Dakota's abortion law, considered one of the most restrictive in the nation, is unconstitutional.
The law, thought to be the nation's toughest anti-abortion measure, was signed by the state's governor last year.
But women should not be forced to go to court, year after year in state after state, to protect their constitutional rights.
It's not a surprise.
Statutory time limits on when abortions can take place, however, vary from state to state.
