Ford and Mazda said 591,245 vehicles were potentially affected, according to the automakers' reports to the NHTSA in 2004.
Several of the reports to the NHTSA involve vehicles not covered by previous recalls, the agency said in a letter to Ford's Environmental and Safety Compliance Global Director on Thursday.
The 2004 Ford and Mazda recalls were for the vehicle speed control cables in their affected vehicles.
The NHTSA has opened the investigation to assess "the scope, frequency and safety-related consequences of the alleged defect," the agency said.
