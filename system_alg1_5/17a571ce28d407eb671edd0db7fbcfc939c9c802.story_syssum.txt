The Hugo Awards were being streamed live on video site Ustream when, at 10:43 p.m.
Ustream says automated software designed to detect the unauthorized posting of copyrighted material was triggered when, before Gaiman's speech, the ceremony showed clips of "The Doctor's Wife," an episode of the popular sci-fi series "Doctor Who," that Gaiman penned.
He said the automated system has been suspended until Ustream is able to "better balance the needs of broadcasters, viewers, and copyright holders."
"Ustream is committed to promoting Internet freedom, and we will strive to continually improve our service to provide the best, legal viewing experience possible," he wrote.
