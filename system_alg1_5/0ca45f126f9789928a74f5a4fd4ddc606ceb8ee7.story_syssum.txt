Buzz Aldrin walks on the moon on July 20, 1969.
Constellation grew of out the Vision for Space Exploration, outlined by President George Bush in 2004, but its future now lies in the hands of the U.S. Human Space Flight Plans Committee.
It may also surprise a generation accustomed to watching the shuttles carry both humans and heavy cargo, like the Hubble Space Telescope, into space.
"It's like having your sports car that's super safe and your large SUV," said John Olson, director of the NASA office that plans and integrates programs including Constellation.
At this point, NASA is favoring the heavily cratered south pole because of its scientific interest and the possible presence of water ice, Olson said.
"We're not doing flags and footsteps," Olson said.
Buzz Aldrin, the second man on the moon, has been an especially outspoken supporter of following "Star Trek's" motto: To boldly go where no man has gone before.
Aldrin plans to present his vision to the U.S. Human Space Flight Plans Committee, Popular Mechanics reported.
Zubrin, who plans to testify before the U.S. Human Space Flight Plans Committee next month, said that if President Obama were to commit the nation to a mission to Mars this year, astronauts could be there by the end of his potential second term in office.
It was created to storm heaven," Zubrin added.
NASA's Olson called the gap a "significant challenge," but said there are no plans to keep the space shuttles flying beyond their current manifest.
However, that is the fiscal reality that we're in and we're doing our absolute best to mitigate it," Olson said.
