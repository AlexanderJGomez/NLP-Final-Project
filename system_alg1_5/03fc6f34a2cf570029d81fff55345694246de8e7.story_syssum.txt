A coalition of organizations established the Amphibian Survival Alliance this month to conserve species threatened by deadly fungus, habitat loss, pollution, pesticides and climate change.
"The world's amphibians are facing an uphill battle for survival," said James Collins of Arizona State University, co-chairman of the group.
But as amphibians die out, so do opportunities to develop new medicines, he said.
"The long-term ecological repercussions of their decline could be profound, and we have to do something about it."
