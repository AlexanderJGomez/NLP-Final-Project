"Yes, I'm 40," Brodeur cracked, predicting the question before it could be asked.
The next active goaltender on the all-time list, Roberto Luongo, has just 339, so it's a record that may never be broken.
"You go out, and you compete against players that are such a young age," Brodeur said during the Devils' second-round series against the Flyers, which they won in five games.
For me, I don't take anything for granted.
When Brodeur won his first Stanley Cup, he was just 23.
Along with his three Stanley Cups (1995, 2000, 2003), he's won two Olympic gold medals (2002, 2010) and the Vezina Trophy as the league's top goalie four times (2003, 2004, 2007, 2008).
"I remember in the playoffs, he once said he was facing more critics than shots," said Roy, who owns most of the NHL goaltending records that Brodeur doesn't have.
"You have to enjoy what you do," he said.
There were only about 20 of them.
"Couldn't find a big enough cake, I guess," he said with a laugh.
