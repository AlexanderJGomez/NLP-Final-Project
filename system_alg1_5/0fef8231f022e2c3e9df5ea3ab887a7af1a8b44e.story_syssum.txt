A family member found John Chakalos, 87, in his home in Windsor, Connecticut, according a Windsor police department press release.
Chakalos and his wife Rita, who died a week before Thanksgiving, were known in Chesterfield, New Hampshire, and the surrounding area for their elaborate Christmas display at the home they owned there.
The display, which has lit up Chesterfield off and on for the past 10 years, is usually completed and ready by Thanksgiving.
The Christmas display will continue this season, Washburn said, but she did not know if the Chakalos family would continue to light up the neighborhood in the future.
