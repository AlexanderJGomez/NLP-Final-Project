Haylee Donathan, her mother Candace Watson and Robbie Potter were discovered hiding for the past week at The Morning Star Ranch, a retreat in Valley Center, near San Diego, said Peter Elliott, United States Marshal for the Northern District of Ohio.
"We understand she is healthy and happy and I believe, waiting to come back to her grandmother here," he said.
Watson, 24, and Potter, 27, were arrested without incident and held by the San Diego County Sheriff's Department.
Potter, a sex offender, had escaped a half-way house on May 28, the day the girl and her mother fell out of sight.
When she is returned to Ohio, Haylee will be placed in the custody of her grandmother, Elliott said.
While on the run, Potter and Watson were reportedly seen on surveillance video on May 31 at a Wal-Mart Store in Marion, Ohio, 40 miles from Mansfield.
Adding to concerns, Watson's roommate, Samantha Covert, said last week in an interview on Nancy Grace that she saw the little girl in bed with her mother and Potter the morning they disappeared.
Elliot said he believed it is a rehab facility and also called it a Christian retreat.
