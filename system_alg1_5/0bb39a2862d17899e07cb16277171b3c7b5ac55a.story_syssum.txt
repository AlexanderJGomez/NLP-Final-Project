President Barack Obama has failed on immigration policy.
That's fiction.
If it materializes, I'll be proved wrong.
But the same thing can't be said of their parents, who did intentionally break the law.
That has never been the case.
Now, if he goes too far, Obama could prove them right.
This isn't reform.
As head of the executive branch, Obama naturally has the power to set priorities for the enforcement of immigration law.
I know that isn't sexy, or inspiring, or inflammatory.
But it does have the advantage of being true.
