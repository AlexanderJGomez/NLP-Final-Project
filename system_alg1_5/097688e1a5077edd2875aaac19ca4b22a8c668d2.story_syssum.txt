Isabelle Stapleton is "awake" and "responding," according to Sara Swanson, Benzie County prosecuting attorney, after being in critical care for carbon monoxide poisoning following a grisly incident last week in which her mother allegedly attempted to take both of their lives.
Matt Stapleton, Isabelle's father, had called police earlier in the day because "nobody had seen" her or her mother "all day," Irwin said.
Stapleton's attorney, Anthony Cicchelli, had no comment.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention says on its website that an estimated one in 88 children has been identified with an autism spectrum disorder, or ASD.
