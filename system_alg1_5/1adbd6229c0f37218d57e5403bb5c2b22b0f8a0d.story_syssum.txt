Madondo's nonprofit, the Kliptown Youth Program, provides free academic support, meals and after-school activities to more than 400 children living in the slum.
Kliptown is one of the very old communities around Soweto, but it's still lacking in things like schools, electricity, running water.
After that, we started singing our KYP songs, celebrating that we are part of history in the making for our country and continent.
We believe that is very important, so our team can also grow with the organization.
... We believe that if people are guided to what they are interested in, that is setting them up for success.
