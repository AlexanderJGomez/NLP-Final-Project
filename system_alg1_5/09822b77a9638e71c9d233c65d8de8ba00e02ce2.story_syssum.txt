Compared to Ford's current SUV champ (the regular production Explorer), the America concept is smaller, lighter, more efficient and more refined.
But even more important than the styling is what's under the America's short hood.
However, for the first time, Ford has combined these two features on a gasoline engine.
While we understand the concept of saving fuel and money, we're not exactly sure what the Explorer America's implies.
Regarding names, we'd actually like to see the return of the Bronco nameplate.
