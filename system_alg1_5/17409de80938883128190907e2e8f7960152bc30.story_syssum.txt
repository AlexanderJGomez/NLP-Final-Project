Monte Dinero, Argentina (CNN) -- When we landed in Rio Gallegos, Argentina it didn't take me long to spot Richard Fenton.
Richard's great-great grandfather, Arthur, came to Argentina from County Sligo, Ireland in 1885 to become Santa Cruz Province's first medical doctor.
Traditionally, he tells me, sheep mostly stay put, continually grazing on the same pastures.
"What we are really trying to do here is imitate what Mother Nature used to do -- which is the natural herding of the wildlife," says Richard.
"We use biological indicators to assess the health of ecosystem processes," says Pablo Borrelli, an Ovis XXI director.
And California-based clothing company, Patagonia, Inc., plans to use the wool in their upcoming clothing lines.
This fact spoke volumes to our company; it isn't often we get to see that far back in the supply chain," says Jill Dumain, Patagonia, Inc.'s director of environmental strategy.
What it is, I donÂ´t know.
And we love it," says Richard's father, David.
The earth could use more pioneers like the Fentons.
