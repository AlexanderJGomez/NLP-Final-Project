In another development, Micheletti said he is willing to meet anywhere with ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya as long as Zelaya agrees to abide by presidential elections scheduled for November 29.
"And, no one can be above the law."
"This is what we Hondurans want: to be heard, for them to read our constitution, to read our laws, and to see what happened before June 28," Micheletti said.
"Yes, we are alone, but we are surviving," Micheletti said.
Around 100 people, including women and children, were inside, Amnesty International said.
