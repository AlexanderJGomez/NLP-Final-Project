Even on short notice, "Taylor the Tailor," as he is known, delivered on his promise -- and made Gill a loyal and satisfied customer.
His story in the apparel business began with the word "wardrobe" itself.
Soon after, Taylor was broke.
"Nine times out of 10 we visit clients in their home or offices, we take their measurements right there inside their office, have them select the fabric they prefer, take their measurements right then and there, and [in] a couple weeks have a tailor-made garment to wear," he said.
With no inventory and a small staff on commission, Taylor's reputation spread throughout the Los Angeles, Chicago, Illinois, and Atlanta, Georgia, business communities, partly with the help of fellow Hampton University alumni.
"Our business model is remarkably fit and lean," he said.
His business has expanded to include custom-tailored dresses, ties, shoes and accessories.
