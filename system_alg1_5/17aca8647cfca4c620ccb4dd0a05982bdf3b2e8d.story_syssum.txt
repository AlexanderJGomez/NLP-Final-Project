My cancer has never returned, but since then I have waged a battle of a different kind -- a three-decade struggle to obtain quality, affordable coverage.
I shopped around, but as soon as I revealed my pre-existing condition, I was denied coverage -- no further questions asked.
Every couple of years I reduced our coverage and gave up our trusted providers to avoid yet another premium increase, until we reached the plan's minimum coverage level.
For decades, we have been denied coverage outright, charged exorbitantly expensive premiums for limited coverage and forced to pay tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars for lifesaving care.
I visited California's marketplace, CoveredCA.com, on October 1 -- the day it went live.
In January, for the first time since my diagnosis 36 years ago, I will have an individual health plan that offers quality coverage for me and my family.
