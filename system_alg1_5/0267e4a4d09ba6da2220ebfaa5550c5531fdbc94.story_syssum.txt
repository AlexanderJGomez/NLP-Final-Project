Krell -- who believes her brother, Owen, was buried on the school's property -- says she's overjoyed at the news.
"We know they're there and once they start digging, then maybe we can find remains and I hope one of them is my brother," she told CNN.
For years, stories and allegations of beatings, torture and murder have surrounded the century-old school.
The mystery surrounding the graves first made headlines in 2008 when Florida's then-governor, Charlie Crist, ordered an investigation after a group of men, known as "the White House Boys," came forward with stories of how they were beaten with leather straps by school administrators inside a small, white building on school property.
At the time, the law enforcement agency said it could not determine where another 50 boys -- who it said died at the school as a result of illnesses or accidents -- were buried, blaming poorly kept school records.
"They said that the body was so decomposed, you wouldn't be able to identify him ... they took him straight out to the school and buried him," she told CNN.
"I believe to this day that they shot my brother that night, and I think they probably killed him and brought him back to the school and buried him," she said.
It will probably be their first good night's sleep in over 70 years."
