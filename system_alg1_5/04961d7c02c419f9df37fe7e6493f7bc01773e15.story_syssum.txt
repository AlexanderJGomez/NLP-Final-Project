Now the estate of Marshall is releasing some of the never-before-seen photos of the band in a new book "The Rolling Stones 1972" (Chronicle Books), out on August 15.
Amelia Davis, a photographer who worked as Marshall's assistant, is the sole owner of Jim Marshall Photography.
"He really was everywhere with the musicians on the tour bus or offstage," Davis said.
It was an extension of him.
"He was their friend," she said.
"Mick was very business-oriented," Davis said.
"Jim was always trying to show the true face of whatever he photographed," Davis said.
He said, 'I was a historian with a camera and I didn't know it.'
