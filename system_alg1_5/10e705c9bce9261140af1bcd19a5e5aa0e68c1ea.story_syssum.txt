Li & Fung, a large trading company that supplies international retailers, said that it had placed orders worth more than $100,000 with the Tazreen factory this year for Kids Headquarters, part of its U.S. subsidiary.
Li & Fung, which is based in Hong Kong, said it was very distressed and saddened by the deaths of workers" at the factory.
All apparel factories were to be closed Tuesday, and special prayers offered at mosques, churches and temples.
They included Dickies, whose owner, Williamson-Dickie Manufacturing Co., said it had concluded its "production schedule" with Tazreen earlier this year.
Police and witnesses said the latest fire, at a 10-story clothing factory in the suburb of Uttara, began Monday morning, and firefighters took about four hours to bring it under control.
The country has about 4,500 garment factories that make clothes for stores including Tesco, Wal-Mart, J.C. Penney, H&M, Marks & Spencer, Kohl's and Carrefour.
But when we heard 'fire,' we all rushed out and we were trying to get out of the factory," said Parul Begum, a survivor.
After the fire, we tried to run out the door, but it was locked.
