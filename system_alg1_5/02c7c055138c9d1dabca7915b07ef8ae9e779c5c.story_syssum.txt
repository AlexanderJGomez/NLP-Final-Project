"Yes, it was a surprise," said Saharkhiz, speaking by phone to CNN from his home in Tehran.
"I was really shocked," he recalled.
Iranian security forces first arrested Isa Saharkhiz, 59, during the summer of 2009.
"They tortured me," he said, describing how officers beat him and broke his ribs during his initial detention.
"In January, in the winter, they sent me on the roof of the jail for two hours when the weather was very cold," Saharkhiz said.
Like others in the reformist movement that emerged from within the ranks of the government of the Islamic Republic, Saharkhiz angered many, including the Supreme Leader," said Behzad Yaghmaian, an Iranian-American academic and author of "Social Change in Iran."
"The least I can do is get their voices out," he said, in a 2010 interview with CNN.
Four years after his arrest, the elder Saharkhiz said there was no formal reason given for his release.
Last month, he called for a negotiated end to Tehran's long feud with Washington over its nuclear program.
"Not the system, but the situation has changed," explained Isa Saharkhiz, during his interview with CNN.
"Maybe in a few years I will be able to go back, but it's a really big risk," he said.
"I will support freedom in Iran, and maybe criticize the leadership in Iran," he said.
It would be, his son said, a dream come true.
