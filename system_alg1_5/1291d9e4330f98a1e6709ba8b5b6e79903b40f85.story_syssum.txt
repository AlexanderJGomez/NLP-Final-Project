The manhunt for Eric Matthew Frein, accused of killing a Pennsylvania state trooper, is over.
"We just thought it was fitting," State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said.
"It actually felt like I was in a war zone a couple of weeks ago, and it was hard to sleep for a few nights, worrying about where he is," resident Mark Denny told CNN affiliate WNEP-TV.
And he wasn't armed at the time of his capture, according to police, much to the relief of authorities who feared a violent showdown.
"He's been stashing food, he's been staying out in the woods," Noonan said.
His voice was strong as he answered, "Yes I do," to a Pike County judge's question if he understood the charges against him, which include first-degree murder and criminal homicide of a law enforcement officer.
Tonkin, the district attorney, said he plans to seek the death penalty.
"I'm sure they will have all precautions taken, not only for his well-being from other inmates but from himself, too," Corbett said.
"Eric Frein had a mission that was to attack law enforcement," Noonan said.
And if not them, civilians.
At least one community, Barrett Township, canceled trick-or-treating as the search dragged on, instead suggesting children show up at a school parking lot to collect candy under the supervision of local and state police.
Outside the police barracks, residents held a sign reading, "Way to Go PSP."
We are so proud of our Pennsylvania State Police, their hard work," another said.
