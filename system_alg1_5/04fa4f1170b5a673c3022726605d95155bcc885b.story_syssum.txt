London (CNN) -- When I was driving through Poland last year, all the talk was about a Chinese company's failure to complete a major motorway project.
What China does in Europe matters greatly, though rarely do I hear or read a positive story about China's influence.
China's tech giant Huawei is a growing power in the telecoms world.
In Huawei's case, as the Economist recently pointed out in a front cover story, the fear is China illegally tapping into western communications, both government and private.
Instead, change appears to be coming from the bottom.
But it did.
That goes to show Europe has to get comfortable with the growing influence of China on its shores.
Oh, then there is that small matter of reciprocity.
