"As soon as we discovered the presence of the malware, we remediated all infected machines, informed law enforcement and began a significant investigation that continues to this day," Facebook Security said in the post.
Unlike Twitter, Facebook said it has found no evidence that any user information was compromised.
Facebook said the site responsible for its attack took advantage of a previously unknown Java vulnerability, which Oracle patched on February 1.
If you must use Java, make sure that you have downloaded the latest updates, which include key security patches.
