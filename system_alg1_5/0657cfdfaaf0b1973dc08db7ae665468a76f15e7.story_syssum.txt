(CNN) -- The grizzly bear that attacked and killed a man in Yellowstone National Park acted in defense, park officials said on Thursday, adding that they have no plans to kill the bear.
"Upon seeing the bear, they began to back down the trail and when they turned to check, the bear was in full charge towards them," Wenk said.
She played dead and the bear left, Wenk said.
Rangers confirmed that he was dead when they arrived on the scene, Wenk said.
This was the Matayoshis' fourth visit to Yellowstone, Wenk said.
"I advise visitors to make themselves aware of the inherent danger if they go into the back country of Yellowstone and to avail themselves of the safety information available to them," he said.
