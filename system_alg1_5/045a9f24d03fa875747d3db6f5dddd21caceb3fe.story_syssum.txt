Musharraf, an army general who overthrew a democratically elected government during a 1999 coup, had previously remained silent about the strikes Washington carried out under his tenure.
Open hostility is not all Musharraf has faced, though.
It is, therefore, no surprise that Musharraf has chosen now to speak out about U.S. drone strikes.
First, Musharraf's statement involved only a limited number of strikes, those conducted during the administration of President George W. Bush.
Under the Obama administration, Pakistan's parliament, in two different sessions, has declared the strikes both illegal and counter-productive.
In this war, the human losses that normally bring an end to war -- like those in Vietnam -- don't exist.
For years, the CIA has refused to tell anyone who it may be killing.
More than four years later, the "change" Obama has brought to Pakistan through drones has resulted in more needless deaths, daily suicide attacks, and growing instability.
