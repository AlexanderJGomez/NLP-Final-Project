"This morning, about 500 opposition supporters along with some Islamic hardliners protested outside the army headquarters, shouting slogans, and some police officers mutinied and joined them," Nasheed's spokeman said.
"This is a situation where the first democratically elected president in the Maldives is taken down by a former dictator and his supporters," the spokesman said.
He's respected as an academic" but has little support of his own, Chakrabarti said.
And that is a cause for international concern, he said.
In 2008, Nasheed became the country's first democratically elected president in 30 years.
Tuesday's events unfolded after about 200 policemen gathered in Republic Square in the capital, Male, according to Ahmed Rasheed, an executive producer at the state TV station.
During his long rule, Nasheed was among his fiercest critics, alleging that Gayoom ruled with an iron fist, crushing dissent, amassing wealth and stacking his administration with friends and relatives.
He had sought a seventh five-year term, saying that he would need a few more years to see through the reforms he has put in place.
He is the subject of an upcoming documentary, "The Island President," that tells the story of his efforts to raise awareness of climate change.
