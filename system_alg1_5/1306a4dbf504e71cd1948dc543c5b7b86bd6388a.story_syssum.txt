Before the game, Moyes -- one bookmaker lists Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp as the favorite to succeed the Scot -- denied reports that he had clashed with Ryan Giggs and van Persie.
"I said to (my team) on Monday morning we have to win 3-0, give the crowd something back because the crowd here has been incredible," Moyes, the successor to managerial giant Alex Ferguson at United, told Sky Sports.
It's all coming from you people," Moyes added, referring to the media.
Van Persie, who led United to the league title last term, and Wayne Rooney were isolated in the loss to Liverpool, with the Dutchman spending the majority of his time in midfield instead of up front.
Olympiacos didn't crumble.

Olympiacos pushed forward and although De Gea had to be sharp, he and the United defense held firm to the delight -- and relief -- of most of those at Old Trafford.
"Maybe they wanted to see a 6-1 win, but that does not happen every day," he told reporters.
