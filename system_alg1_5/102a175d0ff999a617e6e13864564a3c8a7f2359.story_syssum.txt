The protesters -- composed of Bedouin, Palestinians, Israeli and international activists -- were demonstrating against the Prawer Plan, which they say would displace the Negev's original inhabitants.
In the protests here, Israeli riot police -- some of them on horseback -- fired stun grenades, tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon to disperse the protesters, most of whom appeared young.
Amir Abu Quaidar, an organizer of Saturday's demonstration, said the protesters were seeking to pressure the Israeli government to withdraw its plan.
The Prawer Plan would allow Israeli police to use force in its expulsion of Palestinian-Bedouin, they said in a news release.
