A combination of pathogens, disease-causing micro-organisms, is to blame for the illness, the World Health Organization, in conjunction with the Cambodian Ministry of Health, has concluded, the doctors said.
"I'm very confident for the reason of the epidemic," said Dr. Phillipe Buchy, chief of virology at the Institut Pasteur in Cambodia and one of the doctors who cracked the case.
But, he acknowledged, "from the cases we reviewed, almost all of the children died, and almost all of them had steroids."
"Not what is the illness, but now, how long has the virus been circulating?
In the last hours of their life, the children experienced a "total destruction of the alveola(e) in the lungs," Richner said.
Over the weekend, lab tests linked enterovirus 71 (EV71) to some of the cases.
In milder cases, EV71 can cause coldlike symptoms, diarrhea and sores on the hands, feet and mouth, according to the journal Genetic Vaccines and Therapy.
"It looks like (EV71) has emerged strongly, probably because it hadn't circulated with the same intensity in the past years," Tarantola said.
A hospital visit, which often involves a long trip, is a last resort.
