"Most of our farmers ... are illiterate," says Rex Chapota, executive director at Farm Radio Malawi.
The scripts, which are offered for free, are translated in local languages and read in 38 countries, according to the group.
"Right now we are promoting groundnut growing, not only for food, but for income," says Chapota.
"Most often they used to harvest in June, but after listening on the radio they ... harvest their crops in May, which was very important because whenever there's a late time of harvesting, there's a loss of products," says Chimuvi.
"We know that if they improve their famine situation, then their income improves, but also the nutrition improves, and their whole livelihood changes for the better," says Chapota.
