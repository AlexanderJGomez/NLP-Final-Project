"The break-even requirement,' that's in itself a pure violation of EU competition law.
"FFP sounds good," added Dupont.
"In other words, the rule ossifies the market structure.
"Petit says FFP creates what he calls a 'Oligopoleague: the break-even rule destroys competitive balance -- the big clubs will be bigger; the small clubs, smaller ; and no small club will ever again become a big one," said Dupont.
Additionally, they have the feeling that the political cost would be high, said the Belgian lawyer.
And even more so since this threat aims at enforcing a rule that, itself, violates competition law."
"Million and millions of people could challenge FFP tomorrow," said Dupont, who is already contesting the FFP regulations through the courts in a case he is fighting on behalf of football agent Daniel Striani.
"They are free to join the complaint lodged by my client, player agent Daniel Striani, with the European Commission and the civil action he has launched in the Brussels court.
Whether it change European law for a second time remains to be seen.
