"Whites are the highest expression of DNA on the planet," he said on the show.
"This is called statistical noise," Cobb responded.
So while Cobb might "look white" today, in 1813 or 1913, his 14% African ancestry would have been more than enough to render him black by law.
If you were white, you were free; if you were black, you were enslaved.
Mixing, then, lowered human quality.
So, what it meant to be white was to be free of "otherness" in general, blackness, specifically.
Blackness, as an identity and as a lived experience, is much more complex and nuanced than any number of drops on a family tree.
So, while I was thoroughly amused by the sight of Craig Cobb's face when he learned that he, too, is "of African descent," I am clear that those DNA test results do not magically make him black; no number of drops ever could.
