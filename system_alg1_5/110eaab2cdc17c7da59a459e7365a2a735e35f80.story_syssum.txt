"I do know decent, good Palestinian people."
The Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday 695 Palestinians have been killed in the fighting, including 166 children.
More than 4,500 people have been wounded, the health officials said.

"There seems to be a strong possibility that international humanitarian law has been violated, in a manner that could amount to war crimes," U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said Wednesday.

Ban "expresses his outrage, and regret, at the placing of weapons in a UN-administered school," a written statement from the U.N. said.
The Israeli military, meanwhile, said it hit more than 187 targets overnight, and most of them were in Shaja'ia.
The al-Wafa hospital, near hard-hit Shaja'ia, "is a Hamas military compound," the Israel Defense Forces said Wednesday.
The neighborhood is "partially demolished," the ICRC said.
Earlier Wednesday, Kerry met with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who was already on the ground calling for an end to the bloodshed in Gaza.
"Then we can negotiate," he said.
