When Sacha Gervasi, a former teenage Anvil fan-roadie turned Steven Spielberg scriptwriter ("The Terminal"), decided to pursue a documentary about his old heroes, guitarist Kudlow was working part-time in his native Toronto, Ontario, delivering meals to schools.
At times, "Anvil" invokes the spirit of "This Is Spinal Tap" -- besides Reiner's you-can't-make-this-up name, the guys even visit Stonehenge -- but, as Cinematical.com reviewer James Rocchi writes, the film's comedy is cut by an unflinching honesty.
"It's better than most music documentaries.
And quite honestly, it is.
At that point, I knew something was coming.
Reiner: It's fair.
But, outside of that ... it was a Trojan horse to lead people into this.
CNN: A lot of times when a director sets out to make a documentary, the people who are in the documentary say, "You cut this out, you changed this."
Kudlow: Sort of.
Reiner: For me it was Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Grand Funk, Cactus, bands like that.
Reiner: It's like foreshadowing there.
That's what I mean by kismet.
Reiner: We've been touring for 30 years.
Reiner: The music got us here.
We were an influence.
Reiner: It's called the Anvil Experience.
This movie is a rocket launcher to the mainstream, and here we are.
