(CNN) -- The assistant coach of Togo's national soccer team is among the victims of Friday's machine-gun attack on a bus carrying the squad to a tournament in Angola, the country's official news agency reported Saturday.
Lamond said a third wounded person was being evacuated to Johannesburg, South Africa, for treatment.
"It's deplorable for Africa.
I don't know what other countries will decide, but it's hard.
Nevertheless ... we will provide more security and protection to the delegations," Cassoma told Angola's TPA Television.
The Angola tournament has been eagerly anticipated as an early chance to assess the form of African powerhouses such as Drogba and Toure's Ivory Coast, Essien's Ghana and Eto'o's Cameroon ahead of the World Cup.
Togo striker Thomas Dossevi, who plays for French team Nantes, told CNN "armed rebels" with AK-47s had opened fire.
The attack lasted for 10-15 minutes, " Dossevi said.
Togo is a strip of a nation that averages about 60 miles wide, nestled between Benin and Ghana in West Africa.
