The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, based in San Francisco, California, ruled 2-1 Thursday that the pledge does not represent a government endorsement of religion, prohibited by the Constitution.
Among them is Michael Newdow, a prominent attorney and atheist, who had brought his long-standing dispute to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2004.
"But they don't have to take it," he said, referring to the nation's high court, "and the odds are pretty good that they won't."
The same court in 2002 agreed with Newdow and other atheist parents.
In dissent to Thursday's ruling, Judge Stephen Reinhardt said the pledge was an overtly religious message.
It was originally worded: "I pledge allegiance to my flag and the republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."
"Today, the court got it absolutely right: Recitation of the pledge is a patriotic exercise, not a religious prayer.
