Morris, 23, lives in Fort Worth but was visiting friends in Plano, about 50 miles away, when she disappeared on August 30, according to her family.
Morris was last seen by a friend, who walked her to a parking garage at the Shops at Legacy mall just before 4 a.m., but he did not walk her all the way to her car, police said.
Family and friends on Friday night also retraced Morris' steps, hoping to find answers to her whereabouts, the station said.
"We have been able to track the phone's last known location and that was in the Shops at Legacy," Tilley said.
Anyone with information is asked to call police at 972-424-5678.
