The missing woman's mother, Kimberly Scott, said it "is very unusual for Carly to just up and leave without telling anyone," according to a police statement posted on Maui County's Facebook page.
"We are asking anyone who is assisting in the search to call the (police) department if they find any suspicious items, however, please do not touch, move or recover the item as it may be evidence in this case or another case that the department is investigating," the police said.
Up, down.
Frustrated."
