Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post's Tehran bureau chief, was taken with his wife, Yeganeh, from their apartment on July 22.
Jason, a dual Iranian-American citizen, has been at Evin Prison, held on suspicion of somehow posing a security risk to Iran.
We are not Guantanamo.
Last weekend, in Munich, Germany, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif commented on his role in that process.
Furthermore, once assigned to a court, a trial date must be set within 60 days.
And yet there are rumblings that Jason's case will not be heard until after Nowruz, the Persian New Year, which is on the first day of spring, March 21.
This week, Iran is celebrating the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
We have been respectful of Iran, of its laws and its procedures.
It is long past time.
