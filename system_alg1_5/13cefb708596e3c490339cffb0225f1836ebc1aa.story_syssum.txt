Wynn, who will also decide Brown's case, said she believed the testimony of a limousine driver who said Brown hit Adams before Hollosy attacked.
Although Brown faces a misdemeanor charge, the singer has a lot riding on Monday's assault trial in Washington.
Hollosy's attorney, Bernard Grimm, argued in the bodyguard's trial that Adams, 20, was "simply trying to get rich" by accusing Brown and Hollosy of assaulting him.
Brown lunged at Adams, hitting him in the face, she testified.
Brown's mother and aunts, who live in Virginia, along with his girlfriend, Karrueche Tran, and rapper Bow Wow were in court expecting Brown's trial to start.
Brown voluntarily entered a rehab program a day after being released from a Washington jail in October, but he was kicked out a few days later for "throwing a rock through his mother's car window" after a family session at the center, a probation report said.
Brown's probation officer reported at a February hearing that the singer "continues to make great improvement" in dealing with anger, stress and drugs, but the judge decided he could not go free until after his trial for the assault charge in Washington.
The rehab program told Brown to leave because of that statement and two other rules violations, the document said.
At that rate, Brown could complete the labor in mid-October and possibly be free from probation requirements by the end of the year.
