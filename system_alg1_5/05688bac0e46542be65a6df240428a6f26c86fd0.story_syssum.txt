Steyn's career-best 5-34 was his fourth five-wicket haul in 14 tests.
New Zealand, 41 for two overnight, lost nightwatchman Shane Bond, bowled by a Steyn yorker, before Makhaya Ntini claimed the crucial wicket of Fleming, who was well caught by AB de Villiers diving to his left at third slip.
Ntini took three for 47 and Kallis two for 11.
It cost us a lot," said coach John Bracewell.
