In a separate interview on "Fox News Sunday," Odierno said all U.S. troops already were out of Iraq's major cities before Tuesday's deadline.
The 131,000 U.S. troops in Iraq still will "maintain full coordination with Iraqi forces inside the cities" and continue to have intelligence capacity, Odierno said.
"I don't see that" happening, Odierno said.
"I'm not authorized to do anything outside the borders of Iraq," he said.
