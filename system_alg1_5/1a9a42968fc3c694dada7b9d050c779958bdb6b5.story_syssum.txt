So I'm listening to a lot of records, doing my homework there, and trying to determine who is the right match.
Yeah, of course.
I'm different, I've evolved, and I want that to be reflected in the music.
I still want to remain positive with my lyrics and stay in that mode with my music, because I enjoy uplifting myself, if you will, with my songs.
And you feel a bit obsessed about them at this stage as well, I think, because until they get to a producer they're still yours, at this stage where I'm at now.
That's what scares me the most, really.
And I've had a lot of fun just being creative with it and just floating around, changing my mind.
Just talking it through, like we're doing now, does help.
The show took well over a year to put together, so that was a production in itself, like making a record.
I want them to reminisce, but I wanted them to see things in a more refreshed, contemporary way.
I want people to hear the songs they know.
That process, for me, even without being the performer, was a fantastic experience, and really the big reason why I didn't plunge into the record right away.
So I did some of that.
