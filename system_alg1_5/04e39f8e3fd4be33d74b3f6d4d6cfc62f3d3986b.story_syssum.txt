(CNN)Arizona investigators have released dramatic video of a Walmart parking lot brawl that left a police officer wounded, one man dead, and reportedly involved members of a Christian family band.
On the video, an officer tells the group that they "need to separate these folks and talk to them."
Several times on the video the group appears to surrender, but starts fighting again.
At least three members of the family are reportedly in a Christian band named "Matthew 24 Now," which is a Bible verse that refers to the end times, according to CNN affiliate KPHO.
