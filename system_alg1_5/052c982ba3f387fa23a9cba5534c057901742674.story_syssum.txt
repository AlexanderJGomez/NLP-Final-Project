But for the parents of the hundreds of thousands of children who go missing each year, that pain is much deeper; for some, there is never relief.
That was on Monday.
That scenario was both frustrating and encouraging.
No phone, no keys, no money.
When word got out, the community rallied around the missing teen and her family.
Those of us on the ground did everything we could think of, all while having no idea what we were doing.
There was no guide.
About an hour before it was to begin, the young girl was located.
She had run away, and she was home now.
After this experience, I'll never look at news of a missing child the same.
