But for Haitians, placing blame is useless.
Yes, progress is slow.
Even before the earthquake, Haiti was the poorest country in the Americas, with almost 80% living below the poverty line.
These innovations and rebuilding strategies, which began as means of survival, are laying the groundwork for a new Haiti.
In the rural area of Nippes, farmers have developed 4,748 plots of land on which trees, crops, fruit, and livestock are raised together in order to maximize productivity and land use.
SRI uses less seed, less fertilizer, and less water, and grows more rice.
Esline Belcombe, who lost her husband in the earthquake, lives in Corail Camp with her 2-year-old daughter, her mother, and a nephew.
She said, "We want to form our own company to collect and remove rubbish, and then to employ young people who can't find work.
This is our community now, and we should be responsible.
But to us, they represent the promise of a vibrant Haitian future.
