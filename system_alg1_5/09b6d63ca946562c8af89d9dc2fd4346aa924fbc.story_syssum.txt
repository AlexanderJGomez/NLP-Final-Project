The asteroid will skirt around our planet, however, missing by some 27,000 kilometers (16,777 miles).
Made of rock and metal, they range in size from a few meters across, up to the largest -- Ceres -- which is 1000 kilometers wide.
Once a piece of space-rock enters our atmosphere, it becomes known as a meteor.
This, too, is due to the object tearing through the gases above our heads.
It is easy to see why, then, that astronomers are keen to discover the position and trajectory of as many asteroids as possible.
That way they can work out where they are heading and when, if at all, they might pose a threat to us on Earth.
This latest meteor over Russia just goes to show how important such work is and how crucial it is that we keep our eye on the sky.
