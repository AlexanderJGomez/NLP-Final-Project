Poultry products, including eggs, may be contaminated with melamine through animal food.
"If there's a problem with eggs, it should be solved fundamentally."
But the problem could be more pervasive.
CNN contacted the Ministry of Agriculture about the story, but got no immediate response.
Now, it is tainted eggs.
Melamine is high in nitrogen.
"If it's taken over a long period of time, maybe, but if it's ingested only for short period of time it does not pose harm on animals," says He Jiguo, a professor of food science and nutrition at the China Agriculture University.
The dogs and cats that were sickened in the United States were probably eating treats and meals tainted with melamine over a long period of time, he explains.
