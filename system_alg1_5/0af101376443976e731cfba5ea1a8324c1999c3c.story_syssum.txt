Today we honor the memory and the families of more than 100 refugees, young adults, women, and children from Eritrea, retrieved off the southern Italian island of Lampedusa; and of the many dozens who are still trapped at the bottom of the sea.
We also honor the selfless work of the island's residents, tourists, armed forces, medical personnel, and fishermen who have now rescued thousands on their way to Europe.
The overarching answer, in its brutal obviousness, is that they may not legally get on those planes and ferries.
They are poor.
Prisons, radars, and helicopters are not solutions.
EU intergovernmental border patrols (FRONTEX) and national armed forces need to clarify, to themselves and to citizens, whether they patrol the Mediterranean to deter migration, to rescue people, or to intercept and deport them to countries of origin and transit.
They need to demonstrate to lawmakers that they are not "afraid" of their Eritrean, Syrian, Somali, Egyptian, Afghani, Iraqi, Ghanaian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani employees, fianc√©s, neighbors, schoolmates, and coworkers, to mention the nationalities increasingly resorting to maritime journeys.
These are not problems only concerning smugglers, immigrants, and refugees.
They are more rational, and more just, than inaction and methodic negligence.
