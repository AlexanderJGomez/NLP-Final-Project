These are alarming examples, federal investigators say, that show police in Cleveland have been using unnecessary and unreasonable force at a "significant rate," employing "dangerous tactics" that put the community at risk.
Officers also have used excessive force on those "who are mentally ill or in crisis," the Justice Department said.
"The officers, who were firing on the car from all sides, reported believing that they were being fired at by the suspects.
Many officers were there, but none identified any fellow officers who had exacted excessive force on the suspect, and no officer was disciplined, the Justice Department said.
That's when the man, who the Justice Department reports identifies as "Mark," got angry, threatening the officer and trying unsuccessfully to stand up.
Mark had committed no crime, was strapped down and was in the midst of a medical crisis," the Justice Department report says.
It's one illustration, the Justice Department's report says, that "officer training instills in officers an 'us-against-them' mentality."
"As President Obama and I have indicated, the time has come, we think, to do even more.
"Throughout the investigation, the Department of Justice provided its observations and concerns to the city, and in response, the division has begun to implement a number of remedial measures, however, much more work is needed," the department's statement said.
"We will work to make this police department better," he said.
