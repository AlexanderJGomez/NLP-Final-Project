"When we contest the Jewish genocide, we can be punished," Marseille said.
"And up until now, when we contest the Armenian genocide, there is no punishment.
After December's vote in the National Assembly, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused France of committing its own "genocide" during its war against Algerian independence in the 1950s and 1960s.
The French Foreign Ministry shot back at Erdogan's comments, saying France "assumes with clarity and transparency its duty to remember the tragedies that have marked its history."
The genocide debate is also a source of tension between Turkey and the United States, another NATO ally.
