Stalin's involvement in the murder was denied, and never proved.
Of course, Kirov wasn't the first political opponent to fall, any more than Nemtsov was.
In the death of Nemtsov, irrespective of who is ultimately found responsible, we once again have the assassination of a person who could have become the leader of the country.
Nemtsov himself had been the first person to start a systematic analysis of Putin's corruption that, he claimed, includes the building and renovation of 20 palaces, the receipt of $700,000 in watches, his unlimited access to yachts, planes, and a Kremlin property management department with a staff of more than 60,000, and an annual presidential office budget of $2.41 billion.
There is however an optimistic side.
Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube are all alive with information, commiserations, and expressions of extreme anger against the Kremlin.
The fact that Nemtsov's girlfriend was Ukrainian and she was with him when he died was immediately picked up by Russian media.
And despite the fact that initial eyewitness reports stated that the killers were driving a white car without license plates, by noon the next day, RT was claiming that the car had been found, now with license plates from the Muslim republic of Ingushetia.
But standing with them in their insistence -- echoing Nemtsov -- that Putin's authoritarian regime is based on massive corruption, will be more important than ever.
