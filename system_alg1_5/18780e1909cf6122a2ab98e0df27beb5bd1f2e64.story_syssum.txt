President Obama, with Vice President Joe Biden, called for clean efficient travel Thursday.
We must start developing clean, energy-efficient transportation that will define our regions for centuries to come," Obama said at an event near the White House.
Obama has also proposed a separate five-year, $5 billion investment in high-speed rail as part of the administration's suggested fiscal year 2010 budget.
The city of Chicago, Illinois, would be the hub of the proposed Midwest Regional Rail System, which would stretch to Madison, Wisconsin, in the Northwest; St. Louis, Missouri, in the South; and Detroit, Michigan, in the East.
