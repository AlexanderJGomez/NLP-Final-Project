"However hard airlines try, the reputation of food on board planes is not very high," says Peter Jones, former chair of the International Travel Catering Association.
"Clearly, celebrity chefs are hugely successful and airlines are trying to overcome this stereotypical view of their food being unpalatable or stodgy," adds Jones, who is now professor in hospitality management at the University of Surrey in the UK.
"Airlines select products to go on their planes that are consistent with their brand image and the celebrity chef is another factor that makes up a portfolio of an airline's brands," says Jones.
"When flying economy, you'll still be 'stuck' with the 'chicken or pasta' question -- if you are lucky enough to get a meal," says 't Hart, whose website has analyzed over 20,000 meals from various airlines around the world.
Some airlines, including Turkish Airlines and Etihad, are going one step further and bringing chefs on board to cook and prepare meals whilst in flight, he adds.
"I genuinely don't see that happening except as a publicity stunt," he says.
