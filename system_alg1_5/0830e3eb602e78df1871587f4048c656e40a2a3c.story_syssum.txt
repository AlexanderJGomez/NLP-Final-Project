When buying beef, we tend to stick to what we know, which may be why almost 60 percent of our beef dollars go for ground beef.
Humans began domesticating cattle, Bos taurus, about 8,500 years ago.
More than 90 percent of the beef we buy originates in America, while most of the rest is Canadian bred.
Until recently, inexpensive corn has helped keep down the price of beef.
Grass-fed beef has a distinct flavor, often described as bold, complex, and gamy.
Most is imported from Canada, followed by Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and Brazil.
Packers then began selling vacuum-packed beef, the same large cuts sold at warehouse club stores.
There are 29 naturally lean cuts of beef, including many familiar to Cooking Light readers, such as tenderloin, flank steak, and sirloin, as well as five lesser-known cuts.
Others, such as ribeye or chuck roast, naturally contain more fat, although it is similarly divided between saturated and monounsaturated.
All beef is an excellent source of iron, zinc, and phosphorus.
Three grades of beef are sold to consumers.
• Natural and Organic: Beef labeled "natural" must not contain any artificial ingredients and cannot be more than minimally processed, such as ground beef.
Often, leaner cuts are cheaper than fatty ones.
• Be your own butcher.
Buy bigger cuts, and do some of the preparation work yourself.
