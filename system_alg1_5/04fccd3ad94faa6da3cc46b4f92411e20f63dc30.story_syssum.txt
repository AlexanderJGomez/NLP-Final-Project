Zuckerberg's comments at Mobile World Congress, referencing the eye-watering price paid for WhatsApp, were met with surprise.
"That's the service that people want, we would be silly to change it."
Asked if Facebook would consider bidding again for Snapchat, Zuckerberg said: "After buying a company for $16 billion you're probably done for a while."
Zuckerberg's debut at the trade show, the biggest of its kind in the world, underlines the importance of mobile to the future of the social media giant.
"Most people in the world don't have access to the internet at all ... it's about 2.7 billion people today.
"It gives him the opportunity to engage with key mobile operator partners, which will be important in the wake of Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp," she said.
