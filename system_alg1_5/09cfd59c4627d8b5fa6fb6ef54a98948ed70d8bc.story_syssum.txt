So, as we arrived at Pyongyang airport, I felt oddly at home.
No matter where we went over the next nine days, the gaze of Kim Il Sung, or his son, Kim Jong Il, the current ruler known as the "Dear Leader," would follow us, from portraits hung on buildings, monuments, bridges ... to lapel pins on the chests of almost everyone we met, including the two men who greeted us, Mr. Jang and Mr. Song, who would be our guides, minders and controllers for the duration of our stay.
I was told, and so does Kim Il Sung, who died in 1994.
In Pyongyang, it's mostly older Mercedes, often an incongruous baby blue.
This was in the capital, much better provisioned than the countryside, where North Koreans often go hungry.
Grudgingly, they agreed.
Our older guide, Mr. Song, a former diplomat, was more flexible.
When we complimented her on how nice she looked, she said: "They told us you were coming."
They were singing, dancing and laughing uproariously, some of them beating out a rhythm on small red-painted drums shaped like an hourglass.
He turned to me with a smile and said, "They knew you were coming."
Yet, in spite of that hard-edged atmosphere, there is an incongruous feeling of primness, as well.
In Russia, beneath the surface of repressive political control, if you looked hard enough, and spoke the language, you could sometimes find those lonely dissidents living in "internal migration" rejecting the pressure to conform.
As the short, rotund leader enters the stadium, the audience leap to their feet, clapping rapturously as "Dear Leader" applauds them back.
Unable to speak Korean, cut off from unscripted meetings with Koreans, I have no answer.
Korea, he tells me, needs no one.
A life-size figure of the Great Leader, dressed in a suit, standing amid trees near a lake, mountains in the distance.
The music is solemn, stately.
Does he know where his country is headed?
