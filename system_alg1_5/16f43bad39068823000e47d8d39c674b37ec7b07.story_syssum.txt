PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, pictured in 1992.
By then the group's founder, Abdullah Ocalan, was living in exile in Syria where he organized PKK training camps.
In 1998, under intensive Turkish pressure, Syria expelled Ocalan and shut down the PKK camps he had established there.
In the same year Ocalan's brother, Osman Ocalan, who had inherited leadership of the PKK, vowed to form a new group to campaign peacefully for Kurdish rights.
But following the deaths of 27 soldiers and 12 civilians in recent attacks, Turkish military leaders have urged the government to give them the green light to strike at PKK bases inside Iraq.
