"Women here were empowered a long time ago, but haven't had a chance to tell our story," said Ghubash.
"I was looking for a place to build and I came across a very old house that I remember from childhood," she said.
Ghubash said her grandmothers' generation contributed far more to the politics, economy, education and literature of the region than has been recognized.
Ghubash, 56, has undertaken the museum project while taking a sabbatical from a career that led to her being listed 36th on Arabian Business magazine's "100 Most Powerful Arab Women" in 2011.
"My journey in life is very interesting," she said.
Having achieved her goal in opening the museum, Ghubash is not content to rest and revel in the glory.
