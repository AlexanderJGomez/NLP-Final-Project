The new "open" China was full of hopes, dreams and opportunities.
When there is a demand, there was also a reward.
In 2008, China won 51 gold medals (100 medals overall) and topped the gold medal tally at the Beijing Olympic Games.
There is nothing wrong with the obsession towards winning, after all, that's what elite competitive sports is all about but there are other emerging trends that might change the face of sports in China.
However, we also see that more kids (and parents) are embracing sport and the values it teaches.
Through a season of sports training and competition, we help kids to build confidence, work in teams and develop leadership skills.
In today's China, the demand for sports has gone beyond Olympic gold medals and national pride.
