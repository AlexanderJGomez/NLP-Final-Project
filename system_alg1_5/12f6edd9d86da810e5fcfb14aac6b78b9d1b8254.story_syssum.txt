Police found Pagan, a gunshot wound to the head, outside his car Friday evening near the home where the shootings occurred.
In the vicinity, police were alerted to another shooting victim, Pagan's 47-year-old grandson, who was critically injured with a gunshot wound to the head and found outside the Staten Island house where he lived with his mother and girlfriend.
"I just heard a man screaming 'help me, help me,'" a neighbor, not identified, told WCBS.
"There [were] a lot of problems in that house, I could say, but it never really exploded the way it [did] today," an unidentified neighbor told CNN affiliate NY1 News.
