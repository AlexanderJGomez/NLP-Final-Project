The president disagrees, based on a legal analysis of the situation backed by his general counsel, the State Department and Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Carney said.
"As the Justice Department has stated publicly, its views were heard," Carney told reporters.
"Ultimately (the legislation) needs to have enough teeth for it to be to worth it," said one senior House GOP aide.
"For me to get up and tell you that by some miracle, every lawyer in this administration was in agreement on that issue, you wouldn't believe me, because it's simply been too contentious for now 38 years," Carney said.
Even if the House passes measures intended to limit funding for the Libya mission, it is unlikely the Senate would do the same.
"And so it seems to me the kind of limited measured role that the president decided on, in support of our allies who did consider it a vital interest, is a legitimate way to look at this problem."
"The House of Representatives will not allow the White House to continue skirting its obligations to the American people, this Congress, and the laws of this nation," Boehner said in a statement.
If adopted by Congress, the resolution would serve as congressional authorization under the War Powers Resolution, they say.
In its report on the mission, titled "United States Activities in Libya," the administration said the cost of military and humanitarian operations through June 3 was about $800 million.
