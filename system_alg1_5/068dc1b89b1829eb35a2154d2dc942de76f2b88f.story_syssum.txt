This Suffolk, Virginia, house was destroyed by an apparent tornado Monday.
A third twister damaged several homes near Lawrenceville, about 70 miles south of Richmond, said Bryan Jackson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, which confirmed all three tornadoes.
Furniture, fences and mounds of other debris were tossed in streets, parking lots and lawns.
Officials initially reported a fatality, but later determined that it was unrelated to the storm, she said.
