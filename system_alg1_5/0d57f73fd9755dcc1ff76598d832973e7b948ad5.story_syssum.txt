The pope leads a church that includes a sixth of the world's population.
But for all the excitement and ceremony, the pope is not the most important thing about Catholicism.
The issue is not only what the Church should look like.
The media covers the pope as Catholicism because it is easy to cover the pope as Catholicism.
Also, despite the Vatican II council of the 1960s, popes kept expanding their authority.
Finally, the U.S. has always had an obsession with the pope.
U.S. Roman Catholics felt pulled between nation and church.
But the pope is not the dope.
First, vernacular religion.
Second, other Catholics.
As several noted in the comments, Catholicism has already split.
Third, flows.
In the United States, a Catholic woman might attend a Roman parish, work for Catholic Charities, serve as an independent Catholic priest, officiate weddings for divorced Romans on weekends and do Buddhist meditation every morning, too.
And certainly not just the pope.
