(AOL Autos) -- It had never been done before, but as Monte Perlin gunned the engine of his Harley motorbike and prepared to land it in an open boxcar of a moving train, he was strangely calm.
So, he had to do it again.
"Too short, I'm dead.
"I did it again and just hit it perfect," he said.
He got into Hollywood by ditching the small-town naysayers who didn't believe in him, he says, and traveling to Los Angeles.
Perhaps more importantly, Perlin met his wife, also a stuntwoman.
In addition to traveling to Africa, Israel, Russia, and all over the world, the couple raised four kids on a 10-acre ranch about 25 miles north of Hollywood in Lancaster.
Everything, according to Perlin, includes both of his arms, legs, knees, feet, ankles, several of his ribs, his back and his pelvis.
Sometimes this means knowing when to say no and, simply, when to go for it.
I had to jump off a pier, over the water and into a barge.
But the production manager came running out and said, 'If Monte Perlin doesn't do this jump, you all are going home right now.'
"I called down to floor, said I couldn't see the ground," he said.
"For Terminator 3, I got a call to double Arnold, to go in and meet him.
Now (as a double for the) Terminator, I can't be riding and looking, or turning my head.
But, the crane made a swerve and it pulled me off the motorbike, and he's still going.
"For an explosion shot in the movie, I was heading right toward a tanker," he said.
Unless you're Monte Perlin, do not try this at home.
