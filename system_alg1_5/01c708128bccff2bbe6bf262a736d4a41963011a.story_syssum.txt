Washington wonks call these cuts "sequestration."
NextGen, as it's called, is aimed at improving efficiency and increasing safety.
"If the sequester were to occur, we would face some very drastic cuts in services and these investments," said FAA acting administrator Michael Huerta, in an October speech.
"This will affect their ability to fly when they want and how they want," Blakey says.
"A billion dollars is a body blow to the FAA," Blakey says.
The cuts could include the shut down of more than 200 control towers, "which operate almost exclusively at GA locations," she says.
"I do not anticipate that the FAA will reduce hours and personnel at the nation's big air traffic control centers and the TRACON radar tracking centers," she says.
"It's a very big deal to keep that on track," Blakey says.
This is not just about FAA, Blakey says.
But the threat will grow, she warns, unless "people step up and try again to address the long-term issues" surrounding the nation's debt and deficit -- or they postpone the FAA cuts to give themselves more time for a compromise.
