As of 8 p.m. Tuesday, the center of Tropical Storm Arthur was stalled about 90 miles east-southeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida, and 95 miles north-northwest of Freeport in the Bahamas.
By then, it may have changed to Hurricane Arthur, if it gets stronger, as forecasters expect.
Arthur is expected to produce significant, but slightly less, rainfall in the United States.
The islands are low and rain could easily wash onto the roads, making them impassable even before the eye of the storm makes landfall, he said.
"But, for the most part, folks aren't overly concerned."
The good news is that none of the current National Weather Service forecasts for those three cities are predicting winds in excess of 10 mph through Thursday, at least.
