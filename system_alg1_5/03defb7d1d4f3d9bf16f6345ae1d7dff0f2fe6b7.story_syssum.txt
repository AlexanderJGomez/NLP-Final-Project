I know from their e-mails that, like me, they are also unspeakably sad.
Chris was smart, supportive, kind, approachable, very passionate about reestablishing a relationship between the United States and Libya and improving the lives of the Libyan people.
We were both originally from northern California, but Chris and I first met in Libya, arriving around the same time in 2007.
During the two years we worked together, I watched Chris serve with aplomb, patience, and an easy smile.
What really made Chris exceptional to me, however, was his ability to distance himself.
Of course I feel anger at those horribly misguided people who are responsible for this tragedy, but I am also trying to rise above it, like Chris would.
As I continue to watch the Libyans, who have only known oppression, try to dig out of the void left behind in the wake of Moammar Gadhafi's fall, I will always remember Chris and the legacy he has left them.
My hope is hope that Libya will flourish for its people and that we, each in our own way, will make him proud.
