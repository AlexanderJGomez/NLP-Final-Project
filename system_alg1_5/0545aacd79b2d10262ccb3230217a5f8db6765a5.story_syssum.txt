Tarpischev, who is also a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), has already been carpeted by the WTA for "insulting and demeaning" remarks about the American siblings, being hit with a $25,000 fine and a one-year ban from tennis activities.
"The statements made by Shamil Tarpischev on Russian television with respect to two of the greatest athletes in the history of women's tennis are insulting, demeaning and have absolutely no place in our sport," she said.
"Serena and Venus (Williams) are without doubts outstanding athletes," he said in a statement released by Russia's tennis federation.
Unfortunately, his comments do not embody either of these traits and in fact were reprehensible," he said.
Every match is going to be tough, so you have to be ready for that," Williams told the official WTA website ahead of the start of the tournament Monday.
Only three spots are still on offer for the finals after U.S. Open winner Marin Cilic booked his place by reaching the semifinals of the Kremlin Cup.
