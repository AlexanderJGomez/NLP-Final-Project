Simply looking through a small hole is enough to experience 3-D, says Dhanraj Vishwanath, a psychologist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.
In recent years, 3-D has become an emerging technology for blockbuster movies, video games, TV and other media.
The St. Andrews researchers say that, with the approach they explored, people with only one eye or those with problems watching 3-D with both eyes could still experience its "compelling" effect.
They plan to release more findings on 3-D this year.
