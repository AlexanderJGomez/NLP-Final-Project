The infection may have contributed to three deaths, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday.
In one of the Minnesota patients, a 70-year-old female nursing home resident, the infection proved fatal, said Doug Schultz, a Minnesota public health department spokesman.
"We do not know to what extent the salmonella contributed to the death," said Schultz, who added that the patient had other underlying illnesses.
Late last week, King Nut Companies, based in Ohio, recalled King Nut peanut butter.
The seven states that have reported no cases connected to the outbreak are Montana, New Mexico, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Florida and Alaska.
Strains of salmonella linked to outbreaks in the past have been traced to contaminated eggs, meat, poultry, vegetables, pet food and peanut butter.
Most recover without treatment, but some may suffer dehydration and, in severe cases, require hospitalization.
