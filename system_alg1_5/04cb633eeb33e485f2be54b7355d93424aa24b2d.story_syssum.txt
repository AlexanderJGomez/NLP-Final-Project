Marcus Schrenker, 38, of McCordsville, Indiana, pleaded guilty in June to charges of destruction of an aircraft and causing the Coast Guard to respond when no help is needed.
On January 11, Schrenker took off alone from Anderson, Indiana, in a Piper PA46 plane, saying he was headed for Destin, Florida.
After Schrenker made that statement, his aircraft leveled off, and he remained at 3,500 feet while he made course corrections taking him closer to Harpersville, Alabama, where he had stored a motorcycle in a storage facility, the documents said.
The pilots reported that the plane's window was intact, its door was open, no pilot was on board, and the plane appeared to be on autopilot, according to affidavits filed in the case.
In a search of the plane, authorities found handwritten notes on the inside back cover of a campground book, saying among other things, "windshield is spider cracking," "doors open," "bleeding very bad" and "graying out," the documents said.
Examining Schrenker's computer, authorities found Internet searches on how to jump from airplanes and how to open a parachute, among other subjects, the court documents said.
Authorities then "presented various pieces of evidence showing his claims to be untrue," and Schrenker admitted that he called in a false distress message and had intended the plane to crash into the Gulf of Mexico, the documents said.
