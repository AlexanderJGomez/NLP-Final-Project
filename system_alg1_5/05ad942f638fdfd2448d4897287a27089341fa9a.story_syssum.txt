For those on the ground, it's the reality of nearly two years of fighting with no end in sight.
The whole world is not doing anything," Adib Shishakly, a member of the Syrian National Coalition, told CNN on Friday.
"We want the U.S. to help the people on the ground," Shishakly said.
The coalition did not notify the United States ahead of its decision, said the official, who was not authorized to release the information.
The National Coalition, meanwhile, is pushing ahead with plans to create a transitional government despite al-Assad's refusal to cede power.
Of the casualties, 92 were killed in the opposition stronghold of Aleppo, according to the group.
The deaths in Aleppo, according to the opposition, occurred when Scud missiles were fired Friday by government forces at rebel strongholds in predominantly residential neighborhoods.
