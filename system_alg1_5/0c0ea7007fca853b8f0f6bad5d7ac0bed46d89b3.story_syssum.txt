The unprecedented punishment was handed down in March after an NFL investigation found the team had an "active bounty program" during the 2009, 2010 and 2011 seasons.
Their suspensions will begin at the end of the preseason, according to Monday's NFL statement.
"At the conclusion of their suspensions, the commissioner will review the status of each of the three individuals to determine their eligibility for reinstatement," the league said, referring to Payton, Loomis and Vitt.
But he did say in late March, shortly after his suspension was announced, that he was "disappointed" in himself and regretted not being more involved in the team's defense.
