Iran's top negotiator, Saeed Jalili, has said he intends to bring "new initiatives" to talks Saturday with delegates from the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- the United States, France, Russia, China, and Britain -- and Germany.
Last month, Iranian officials signaled they were ready to engage with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, over the issue.
As a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, Iran has the right, like other countries, to enrich uranium for commercial and research reactors.
"Iran, coming to the table, needs to demonstrate that they are serious."
