For his feature film debut, "Margin Call," he wrote the script and directed a cast that included Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons and Demi Moore.
He spoke to CNN about how the film came together, the challenges of building tension and his promising future.
For a long time, we had the actors but no money.
Hopefully, as the information travels up the chain of command, you see (the characters) in their own way regretting, or glossing over and moving on, or all the different emotions that happen when you see your own role in a tremendously damaging event.
If it was underpaid and under-budgeted, I was doing it.
Amazingly, this has been sort of the cherry on the sundae.
The film was very well received for what it was, which has allowed me to direct again, and everybody made their money back, so I've been pretty blessed from that standpoint.
