A crowd protests the court ruling upholding Proposition 8 in Los Angeles, California, Tuesday.
"Our Constitution guarantees every American the right to be treated equally under the law," Boies said.
Boies, meanwhile, was the top legal strategist for former Vice President Al Gore, that year's Democratic presidential nominee.
The lawsuit is backed by the American Foundation for Equal Rights, a newly formed organization based in Los Angeles.
"Right now, Californians support traditional, natural marriage 49 percent compared to 43 percent for same-sex marriage," said Garlow, who supported Proposition 8.
As people get more familiar with the reality, the sanctity of marriage, how special marriage is, why a child should have a mom and dad, they shift to the traditional marriage view."
That measure, like Proposition 8, had been approved by voters.
