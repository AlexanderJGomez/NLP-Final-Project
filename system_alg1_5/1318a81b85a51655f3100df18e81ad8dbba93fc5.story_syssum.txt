(InStyle.com) -- Michelle Obama dazzled on the dance floor Tuesday night at the Neighborhood Inaugural Ball in Washington, wearing an elegant, one-shouldered ivory gown created for her by 26-year-old designer, Jason Wu.
Obama was likely introduced to the designer in one of her favorite Chicago, Illinois, boutiques, Ikram.
She prefers bright, cheerful shades such as yellow, electric blue, red and purple, and has been seen on multiple occasions in head-to-toe looks from moderately priced American retailer J.Crew.
"We ladies, we know J.Crew."
"People tend to think classic looks are synonymous with boring, but they're not," he explains.
It's all about looking polished, like you know what you're doing."
