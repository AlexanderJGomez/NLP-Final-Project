Stump:  There weren't a lot of people knocking down our doors, going, "When's the next Fall Out Boy record?"
Andy Hurley:  Which is nice, because then you make something that you're happy with, and you don't have to do something for this group of people, which is a great way to do it.

CNN:  Joe, you and Patrick got married.
Wentz: I took my kid to preschool today, and he has a friend who is really into music there -- this little kid -- and he was like, "I want to play Fall Out Boy right now."

Stump: On the subject of arena tours, it's interesting.
