Michael Vick will be confined to this Hampton, Virginia, house for the rest of his sentence.
He was freed from the U.S. Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas, on May 20, and returned to his home in Hampton, Virginia, the following day.
Now, however, he has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
In testimony before the bankruptcy judge, Vick acknowledged committing a "heinous" act and said he should have acted more maturely.
