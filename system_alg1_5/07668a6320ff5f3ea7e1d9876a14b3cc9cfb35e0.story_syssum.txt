The Greek people voted clearly to reject the austerity demanded by international lenders, said Tsipras, leader of the Syriza Party.
Venizelos said PASOK would not form a coalition with Syriza, as the party would only participate in a coalition government that would secure Greece's position in the eurozone.
Fotis Kouvelis of the Democratic Left, which splintered from Syriza in 2010, told Tsipras that when they met Tuesday Syriza needed the support of more than just the left, Tsipras' bloc said.
New Democracy leader Samaras said he did "everything possible" to form a coalition, but none of the parties agreed to join with his party, which won first crack at forming a government after finishing first in Sunday's parliamentary elections.
Politicians have until May 17 to come up with a new working alliance or, if they cannot, set a date for another round of elections.
Together, the parties fell short of the 50% necessary to continue the coalition, requiring formation of a new government.
Last year, Greece's debt threatened to force it to drop Europe's common currency, the euro, prompting the European Central Bank and other lenders to swoop in with emergency funding.
For two years, the country's massive amount of debt has threatened the stability of the 17-country eurozone.
