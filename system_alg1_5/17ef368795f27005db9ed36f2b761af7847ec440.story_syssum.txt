The second reason Tuesday's transition is historic is because the son, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, now becomes the youngest monarch in the region.
He is 33.
Jamie Ingram, a Middle East analyst at IHS Global Insight, said that while Sheikh Tamim had been groomed for power for some time, especially over the past two years, it was still a surprise to see the handover come so soon.
It's the first time in recent history we have seen such a transfer of power from a living monarch to the next generation," he said.
But how greatly it will be involved in Syria under Sheikh Tamim "is the big question," said Ingram, since Qatar has already started to pull back on that front and let Saudi Arabia take a lead.
Another said, "I have watched Qatar become an economic, sports, education and political leader.
However, Sheikh Tamim's youth "doesn't mean that he will be more open to democratic reforms," as some might hope, he cautioned.
