(CNN) -- The days of memorizing arcane, recondite vocabulary words might be ending for high school students who will take a redesigned SAT in two years.
Instead of a point for each correct answer and a deduction for an incorrect answer, the new test will use "rights-only scoring," which means a point for a correct answer, but no deduction for wrong answers.
But, there will be no more mandatory essay, leading to the next big change.
For example, the College Board documents provide a passage and asked students to write an essay explaining how the author "builds an argument to persuade his audience" by looking for "evidence, such as facts or examples, to support claims," or stylistic elements, "such as word choice" to add power to the ideas expressed in the passage.
And, unlike the current version, students will be required to put away their calculators for 25 minutes.
One sample question asks students to read a political speech and determine which lines support the overall argument.
