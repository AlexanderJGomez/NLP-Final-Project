"In order to avoid my colleagues' having to defend me during their elections, I have this morning sent a letter to Speaker Pelosi asking her to grant me a leave of absence until such time as the ethics committee completes its work," Rangel said Wednesday.
Rangel is being investigated for, among other things, failing to pay taxes on a home in the Dominican Republic.
The committee found that while Rangel did not know about the contributions, he was nevertheless responsible.
Rangel is a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, which has 42 members in the House.
