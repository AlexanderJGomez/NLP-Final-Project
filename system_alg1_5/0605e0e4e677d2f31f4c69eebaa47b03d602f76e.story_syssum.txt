By sheer numbers, the Google Books project has been a huge success.
Google did not seek approval to scan many books that were still under copyright, nor did it offer to compensate authors or publishers in any way, claiming the scans were fair use.
"As we have long said, Google Books is in compliance with copyright law and acts like a card catalog for the digital age, giving users the ability to find books to buy or borrow," said a Google spokesperson.
The books scanned are also primarily nonfiction titles, which have less copyright protection than fiction.
"This has been a long road and we are absolutely delighted with today's judgment," said the Google spokesperson.
