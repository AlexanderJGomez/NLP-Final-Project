Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who is blamed for the using his military to clamp down on opposition forces, is once again a candidate.
Syrian troops lobbed shells laced with chlorine at a western Syrian town on Thursday, causing dozens to suffer from the inhalation of toxic gas, the opposition-run Hama Media Center said.
A man in scrubs turns to the camera while treating the victims and says, "This is a chlorine gas attack."
Also Thursday, the Syrian government wrested control of the Central Prison in Aleppo, breaking a 13-month rebel siege on the sprawling complex where dozens of political prisoners are believed to be held, according to opposition groups and Syrian state media.
