A man arrested in connection with the stabbing deaths had been scheduled to appear before a judge Tuesday, but that appearance was pushed to Wednesday, according to the island's solicitor general, Taco Stein.
"There are strong indications he is involved in the crime," Stein said Monday of the suspect, without divulging details.
He had signs of a "beating," according to Brooks.
"Some things are missing" from the King's home, but there were no signs of a break-in, he said.
"It just seems very senseless," he said.
