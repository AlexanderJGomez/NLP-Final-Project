London, England (CNN) -- If the location is anything to go by, then the omens are promising.
"It is, by far, the largest conference we have ever held and the largest political conference in Europe," the Bella Center press manager, Lars Lemche told CNN.
This is 11 days," Lemche said.
Outside the conference center solar-powered streetlights are helping light the car parks.
Jason Heppenstall, Editor of The Copenhagen Post, a weekly English language newspaper told CNN: "There hasn't been much of a build up until the last few days.
And now that the conference has started, 6000 officers will be on duty during the conference.
The only confrontations in the buildup to the conference have been between Copenhagen's female mayor, Ritt Bjerregaard, and the city's prostitutes.
There are prostitutes here, but it's not like Amsterdam," Heppenstall explained.
They see this as their big moment."
