Speaking into a microphone, Malema, who appeared without his trademark beret and donned a dark suit and burgundy tie for the hearing, addressed his raucous supporters near the court.
The 31-year-old, who was youth leader for the African National Congress, was thrown out of the ruling party this year.
"Hands off Malema," placards outside the court read.
Malema, once a major ally of the president, is now one of his fiercest critics.
Malema's brash, populist message resonates with some of the nation's disenfranchised, who took to the streets in protest when he was ousted from the ruling party.
Malema was instrumental in the president's election and campaigned across the nation on his behalf.
Polokwane, which is north of Johannesburg, is the capital of Malema's native Limpopo province.
