"We think that Sugru can be something as big or bigger than duct tape, superglue or anything else that you use to repair," says its Irish-born inventor Jane Ni Dhulchaointigh.
"But for me, I knew that there was something there.
I just didn't know what it was."
And I was there beating myself up going, I can't find the application for this material, until my boyfriend James said to me one night, maybe there's not this one perfect thing for this material.
"It has been a long journey," she says.
I mean, we probably pitched to over 100 investors where we got, maybe two or three over the years."
Perhaps, the most unique thing about Sugru is that its practical uses is being demonstrated not by its inventor, but by the general public.
They do things with it that we couldn't have dreamed of.
It's not only wasteful, but it doesn't make the most of us as human beings with all the potential that we have."
