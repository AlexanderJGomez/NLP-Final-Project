The man, himself, did not identify himself by name though he did say he was a former soldier who was working as a civilian when he was abducted.
The man said he had been abducted in Baghdad on June 18, 2011, by "Yom al-Maoud under the direction of Sayyed Muqtada al-Sadr," also known as the Promised Day Brigade.
Maha al-Douri, a lawmaker and a member of the al-Sadr movement, said at the news conference that the man had been in captivity for nine months, consistent with the reported June 2011 abduction date.
Bahaa al-Aaraji, the head of Sadr's Ahrar political bloc, said the man was "captured in battles" but had no further information.
"He just disappeared," she said.
