But, amazingly, he has battled his way back to the top.
His ever-present pet Chihuahua, Loki, is also there, slumbering quietly by Rourke's side in a tiny gray hooded top.
(In his Golden Globes acceptance speech, he thanked his dogs saying, "Sometimes when a man is alone, that's all you've got is your dog.")
he says, giving an example of a particularly bleak time, "And you're standing there in the dark with your thumb up your ass."
But it was more than that.
Whatever it was, Rourke gave up acting and took up professional boxing for four years in the early 1990s and, it seems he was able to fully indulge his self-destructive streak.
But, he says he persevered and straightened out "some issues from my childhood."
"I'll never lose it all again," he says, "It was too much hard work to get it back and too lonely and too dark.
It would be too hard to take."
