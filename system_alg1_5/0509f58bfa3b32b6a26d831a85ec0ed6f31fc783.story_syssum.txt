(CNN) -- I love you Rihanna.
You, Rihanna, succinctly said, in two words, how many women feel for getting blamed for everything from raising "problem children" to "feminizing" men.
Oh, and don't say you didn't penalize Rihanna for what Ray Rice did to Janay Palmer.
As Rihanna tweeted, "The audacity..." and forbade CBS to use any of her songs in its Thursday Night Football lineup ever again.
It would have been a colossal mistake to bully Rihanna into singing for the NFL.
Dare I say again, I love you Rihanna.
