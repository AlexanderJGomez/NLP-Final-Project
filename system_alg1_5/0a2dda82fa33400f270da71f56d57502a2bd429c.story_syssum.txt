The cards only work at four stores for now: Target, Jamba Juice, Sephora and The Olive Garden.
The cards will be rolling out gradually for Facebook users in the United States.
This new card is different because it will work at multiple retailers, is refillable and integrates with the Facebook app.
Even though you can see your card's balance on a smartphone, there aren't mobile payment options at the moment.
In order to receive the card, the recipient will have to share their mailing address with Facebook, which might make some people uncomfortable.
There are no fees for the gift giver or gift receiver, so Facebook is likely earning a percentage from the participating companies.
