A man walking through the woods found him Friday "lying in leaves, covered in a blanket with a Bible and a wheelchair nearby," Philadelphia police say.
For more than four days, police say, the quadriplegic man, who also suffers from cerebral palsy, was left lying in the woods of Philadelphia's Cobbs Creek Park.
"The mother went to visit her boyfriend down in Maryland, over in Montgomery County, and we believe she placed the child into Cobbs Creeks Park," Walker said at a news conference.
When police tracked down the mother, she told them her son was with her, Walker said.
Two of his aunts, who have tried to obtain guardianship of him, were staying with him at the hospital, police told the website.
The mother's arrest was only the beginning of the investigation, Walker told reporters.
