Leslie Waffen, 67, of Rockville, Maryland, pleaded guilty in October to an eight-year scheme to embezzle historic recordings donated to the government in order to peddle them on eBay.
"These items were entrusted to the National Archives to be used by all citizens, not to be auctioned for personal profit to the highest bidder," said Rod Rosenstein, the U.S. Attorney in Maryland.
That former radio engineer, J. David Goldin, told the Washington Post he saw the listing for the Babe Ruth hunting recording when he was searching the Internet in September 2010.
Goldin, a radio historian and collector, assisted law enforcement in its investigation of the stolen recordings.
