Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- In 1998, Kevin Warwick became what some people call "the world's first cyborg."
To be exact, Warwick, a professor of cybernetics at Reading University, had a radio frequency ID chip implanted in his arm.
This isn't just for fun, Warwick tells Motherboard.tv, VBS' technology channel.
Augmenting human ability, not turning into an automaton, is, after all, the premise of the "cyborg."
Someday, says Warwick, humans could become "a curiosity for the machines."
