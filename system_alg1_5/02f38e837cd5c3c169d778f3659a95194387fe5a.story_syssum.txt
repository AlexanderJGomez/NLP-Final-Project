LONDON, England -- Painfully hot, they make your eyes water, your heart race and can turn your face embarrassingly red.
The "ghost chili", also known as bhut jolokia, has more than 1 million Scoville units, while Tabasco sauce ranges from 2,500 to 5,000 Scoville units and jalapeno peppers from 2,500 to 8,000 units.
Other than for its flavor-enhancing qualities, chili is, oddly enough, used to fight the summer heat.
As the chili causes extreme sweating and blood rushing to the face, it cools the body down when the sweat evaporates, making it useful for combating heat.
Chilies have long been associated with soothing the digestive system, by acting as stomach cleansers.
Chili peppers are also a good source of vitamin B6 and are very high in potassium, magnesium and iron, giving them a reputation for naturally boosting the body's immune system.
