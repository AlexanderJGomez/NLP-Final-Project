First Lt. Roslyn L. Schulte, 25, graduated from the Air Force Academy in 2006.
"Losing Lt. Schulte has been a tragedy felt by everyone here and across the Air Force," said Col. Terrence O'Shaughnessy, 613th AOC commander.
"She knew how to talk to chiefs of staff, to generals, to privates, and they listened," Robert Schulte told the paper.
"And that's what we needed, a great leader of people."
