"The Fair Sentencing Act will reduce sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine from 100-to-1 to 18-to-1," said Congressman John Conyers, D-Michigan, who applauded the passage.
The House measure, passed on a voice vote with bipartisan support, follows passage by the Senate in March.
"This day was long in coming," said Holder.
The top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee Lamar Smith, R-Texas, argued vigorously shortly before passage that to reduce the crack cocaine penalties would be a serious mistake.
And more than any other drug, the majority of crack defendants have prior criminal convictions," Smith said.
