This is Erich Nowsch.
The profile photo on what appears to be his Facebook page, last updated in January 2013, shows him with his tongue wagging, his hand tattooed, with a ballcap on his head and thick chain around his neck.
"We knew how bad he was," Robert Meyers told reporters.
And his distraught mother wasn't talking, turning away reporters.
The daughter honked the horn, prompting the car to stop.
Soon after, a car showed up in the Meyers' cul-de-sac.
She died two days later, on Valentine's Day.
That was the extent of what authorities knew about the back-and-forth between Nowsch and Tammy Meyers until Thursday, according to Las Vegas police Capt.
She fed him, she gave him money.
