Recently, researchers found that consuming a Mediterranean diet heavy in olive oil can help lower some heart risks.
In addition to olive oil, they can be found in avocados, nuts and fatty fish.
Olive oil is full of polyphenols, a type of antioxidant that helps protect your cells from damage.
"Essentially, you crush an olive and out drops the oil in extreme synthesis."
A bottle of oil will last about a year on your shelf, according to the Stillwater Olive Oil Co. "After this time, the taste and health benefits, such as Vitamin E, beta-carotene, and other phenol levels decrease dramatically," the company's website states.
But the U.S. may not be there for long, according to the report.
"It is expected that in the near future, India and China will be on the list of largest consumers of olive oil, as people have started recognizing the health benefits of olive oil and have accepted it as cooking oil," a release from the site says.
If you're not ready to spring for the professional products, you can use olive oil at home to create a hair mask or as a cheap eye makeup remover.
