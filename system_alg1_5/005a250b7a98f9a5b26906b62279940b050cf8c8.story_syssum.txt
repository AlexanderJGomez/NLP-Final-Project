"A flasher keeps flashing people at the mall, so they call in the 'real police,' which is me," Liotta told the Columbus Dispatch.
The 54-year-old actor also starred in 2007's "Wild Hogs," a comedy co-starring Tim Allen and John Travolta about a group of middle-aged suburban men who decide to become bikers.
"Edgy guys stand out in people's minds," Liotta said of his famous "bad guy" roles, according to the Dispatch.
In 2004, Liotta starred in an episode of the hit NBC drama, "ER," winning an Emmy for his guest appearance.
