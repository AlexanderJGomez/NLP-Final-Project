(CNN) -- Sen. Ted Kennedy would have had a "very, very difficult" time politically surviving the drowning death of a young woman if it happened in the era of blogs, talk radio and 24-hour news cycles, experts said.
That his brothers, John and Robert, had been assassinated in recent years may have been a factor, experts said.
"If at any time, the citizens of Massachusetts should lack confidence in their senator's character or his ability, with or without justification, he could not in my opinion adequately perform his duty and should not continue in office," Kennedy said.
However, 58 percent of respondents said "he has suffered, been punished and should be given the benefit of the doubt."
New media and talk radio would be a "much more ferocious force" today, he said.
In his national address, Kennedy said he was driving Kopechne to a ferry landing because she was tired.
"The car overturned in a deep pond and immediately filled with water," Kennedy said.
They, too, failed in saving Kopechne, he said.
"The larger anger about it was the 10-hour lag [in reporting the accident], that he was more concerned about his reputation than this young woman's life," Baughman said.
If Kennedy survived his first re-election, as he did in 1970, he likely would have prevailed in later ones, though it would have been "very, very difficult to remain in office," Arterton said.
Kennedy's explanation was a "weak defense," Arena acknowledges, but he insists there was no evidence of negligence to facilitate manslaughter charges.
"When you tell the truth, you don't have to worry about what you said the first time," he said.
