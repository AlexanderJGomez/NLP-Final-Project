"I am not going to forbid you from watching the Super Bowl if that's something that's really important to you," she said.
Hernandez, 25, pleaded not guilty in the 2013 killing of Lloyd, 27, who dated the sister of Hernandez's fianc√©e.
Her sister, Shayanna, is Hernandez's fiancee and mother of his child.
In opening statements Thursday, defense lawyer Michael Fee said the two men were close friends and that Hernandez had no reason to kill Lloyd.
"Aaron Hernandez is not the murderer of his friend," Fee said.
In the front row, Lloyd's mother wept.
A marijuana blunt found near Lloyd's body had traces of both his DNA and that of Hernandez, Bomberg said.
"As soon as they found out Aaron Hernandez -- a celebrity football player for the New England Patriots -- was a friend of Odin Lloyd's, it was over," he said.
On June 16, 2013, Lloyd was riding with friends in a black Chevrolet Suburban, which police later learned was rented by Hernandez.
Close friend Daryl Hodge was with Lloyd when he said Lloyd got a text from Hernandez, asking to hang out later that night.
