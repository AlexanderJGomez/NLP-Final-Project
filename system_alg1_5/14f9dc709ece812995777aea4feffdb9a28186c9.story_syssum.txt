Protesters in Peshawar, Pakistan torched two movie theaters in the city Friday morning, in protest against the film and the cartoon, a fire official said.
"Punish the blasphemer," children chanted Thursday.
The film reference is to the "Innocence of Muslims," which mocks Mohammed as a womanizer, child molester and killer.
The event was not formal or planned, so authorities didn't know ahead of time it would happen, he said.
About 100 demonstrators gathered last Tuesday near a U.S. diplomatic facility in Medan, Indonesia, the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta said.
"We should not fall in the trap of provocation, we should rather denounce these acts by peaceful means," Mansar said, according to a TAP report.
