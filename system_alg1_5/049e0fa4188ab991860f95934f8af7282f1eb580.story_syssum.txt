Basic in its design, but simultaneously elegant-looking, the TC-35LX85 has a glossy black finish, with a 3-inch-wide bezel surrounding the screen on all sides.
Unfortunately, the remote is not backlit.
At this screen size, however, the benefits of 1080p resolution are nearly impossible to discern with moving video, whether standard- or high-definition.
Preset picture modes include Cinema, Game, Custom, Vivid, and Standard.
In the Advanced menu there are two varieties of noise reduction, called Video NR and MPEG NR, and for high-quality sources both should be turned-off.
Strangely, for their TVs, it is backward.)
The Panasonic LC-32LX85 is one of the better performers at its size in the entry-level, 720p-resolution LCD category.
Black level: Blacks are reasonably good for an inexpensive LCD flat-panel TV, and deeper than either the Sony or the Vizio, although not quite as deep as the Westinghouse.
The black areas of the picture were deep, rich, and inky, and the scene was relatively free of low-level noise.
Colors still appeared vibrant, however, and skin tones looked quite natural.
This Panasonic, while not perfect, was better than most in this performance test.
The set's noise reduction, on the other hand, was very good at cleaning up moving motes in low-quality images of skies and sunsets, and the set engaged 2:3 pull-down detection quickly and effectively.
The best resolution the video card allowed was 1,280x768, which is short of the set's native resolution, and there was enough overscan that important areas of the screen, including the Windows taskbar, were obscured.
