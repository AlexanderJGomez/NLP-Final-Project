"I've instructed my attorney to sue Rita Cosby, the publisher and any source that spits out some of that false, defamatory information that's in there," Birkhead said Tuesday on CNN's "Larry King Live."
Birkhead said Cosby's sources on the Stern allegations were two maids, whose reliability is questionable, and Jackie Hatten, a woman who claims to be a friend of Smith's -- and who, according to the book, says she is the one who walked in on Stern and Birkhead.
"There was nothing to walk in on because, you know, nothing like that's ever happened, and there's definitely no video of it."
Stern's attorney, Lin Wood, "is a monster," Rale said, "and this guy is going to go after Rita Cosby and the publisher."
Stern and Birkhead, she said, were previously engaged in a legal struggle against each other and appeared to be enemies, but "now they're friends ... and it begs the question why.
Birkhead said Cosby's comments are "crazy ... she says she's never seen the video that she reports in her book that exists, and now she's backpedaling, saying, 'How else could you explain two guys that are enemies now get along?'
