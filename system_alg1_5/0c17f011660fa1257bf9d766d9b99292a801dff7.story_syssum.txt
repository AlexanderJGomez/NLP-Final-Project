(CNN) -- When 48-year-old Erin Peiffer, of Eldersburg, Maryland, learned that she had high cholesterol in her 20s, she never thought it would pose a problem.
"For middle-aged women, 40 to 60, high cholesterol is the single most important risk factor for heart disease and heart attacks," she said.
"I started coughing," she recalled.
After performing an angiogram, her doctors told her the bad news.
"They told me I had a 99 percent blockage in my left main artery," she said.
LDL, or low-density lipoprotein, is the bad cholesterol because it clogs the arteries, increasing a person's risk for heart attack and stroke.
In some people, improving diet and adding exercise can lower the overall number, but when lifestyle changes don't work and for people who have a genetic predisposition for high cholesterol, medication is usually prescribed.
Your overall cholesterol number should be under 200.
The first step in fighting high cholesterol is simple: "Get a blood test," Nabel said.
It gives your doctor information about total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglycerides, which are the main type of fat in blood.
Even 30 minutes of moderate exercise, five days a week or more, can make a difference.
And most important, she knows her numbers: Her cholesterol is well below 200.
It could save your life."
