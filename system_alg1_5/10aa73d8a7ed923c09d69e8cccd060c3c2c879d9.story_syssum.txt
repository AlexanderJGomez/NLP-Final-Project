Messi, the reigning FIFA world player of the year, also netted a hat-trick for the defending champions, who have beaten Real in their last four league meetings.
"Nevertheless, whatever happens, 25 league games will still remain.
"This will not be decisive though, but whoever does win will surely be considered to be the champions for the next week at least," he told his club's official website.
That's all," claimed Mourinho, who masterminded a Champions League semifinal victory over Barcelona as Inter Milan coach last season.
"Talking about a duel between myself and Messi is nonsense," Ronaldo.
"Real will come to Camp Nou with revenge in mind," Messi told AFP.
