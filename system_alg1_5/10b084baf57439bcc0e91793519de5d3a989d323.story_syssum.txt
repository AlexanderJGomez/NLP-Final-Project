It is still unclear what exactly happened when Sainz, from the Mexican network TV Azteca, entered the Jets locker room last Saturday after practice but Sainz told CNN's Rick Sanchez on Monday that from the moment she entered, she felt all eyes were on her.
"But I really know that she heard something that I didn't hear, and the rest of the media that was inside heard things that I didn't hear," Sainz told CNN.
"I think that it's not good that these kinds of things happen and it mustn't happen anymore," Sainz told CNN.
"Everyone knows that a woman or a man deserves the same treatment in the locker room."
