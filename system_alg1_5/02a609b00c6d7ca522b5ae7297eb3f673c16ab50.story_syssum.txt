On Wednesday, the Saudi government carried out the sentence in a gruesome fashion, by beheading Rizana.
After the baby died, Rizana gave a confession that she said was made under duress -- she later retracted it.
When Rizana traveled to Saudi Arabia, for example, she may not have known that many Saudi employers confiscate domestic workers' passports and confine them inside their home, cutting them off from the outside world and sources of help.
Conditions for migrant domestic workers in Saudi Arabia are among some of the worst, but domestic workers in other countries rarely enjoy the same rights as other workers.
During 2012, dozens of countries took action to strengthen protections for domestic workers.
Perhaps most significantly, eight countries acted in 2012 to ratify -- and therefore be legally bound by -- the Domestic Workers Convention, with more poised to follow suit this year.
All governments should ratify the convention.
And they can protect millions of other domestic workers who labor with precariously few guarantees for their safety and rights.
