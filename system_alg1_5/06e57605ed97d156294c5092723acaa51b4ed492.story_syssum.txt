Utah will reopen its five national parks by Saturday, as well as three other nationally run locations.
The deal would reopen Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, and Zion national parks.
The process of opening the parks after receiving the money should take some time, but in a statement from the governor's office, the state anticipates all sites should be "fully operational by Saturday".
However, as with other funds spent during the shutdown, Congress is under no obligation to refund the bill.
