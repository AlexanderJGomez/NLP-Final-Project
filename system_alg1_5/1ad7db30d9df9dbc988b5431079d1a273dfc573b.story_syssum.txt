The hours that Erhardt had been working are not unusual.
The extreme work culture used to be the preserve of a few elite professions, such as banking or law.
But it comes at a huge cost.
In addition to damaging the body and mind, long hours at work cut people off from their family and friends.
The result is that their social network withers and, over time, can die.
If days are spent only working, then there is little time to put into local clubs, faith groups and associations.
Employees in Germany and France work less hours but get more done.
There are so many good reasons to end the extreme work culture.
Remember, we work to live, not live to work.
