But while she battles for the gold, Johnson is fighting another battle: with Crohn's disease, one of the two most common inflammatory bowel diseases, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
However, many suffer in silence, as the effects of Crohn's are often not openly discussed.
Crohn's disease is an autoimmune disease of the digestive tract that most often affects the small or large intestines, and sometimes both.
"Crohn's is a chronic, lifelong disease for which there is no cure," he said.
"Because its cause is unknown, and because flare-ups happen without warning, those diagnosed with Crohn's face a life of challenges and uncertainties.
In recent years, there has been significant success in treating symptoms, and in some cases bringing about remission, with the use of newer anti-TNF drugs such as Remicade, Humira and Cimzia.
Left untreated, Crohn's spreads throughout the intestinal tract, causing more severe symptoms and a bleaker prognosis.
The two most common surgeries for Crohn's disease are bowel resection surgery, which involves removal of the deteriorated portion of intestine, and fistula repair surgery.
"It's not a matter of if we find cures; it's a matter of when, and that's determined by available funding," said Richard Geswell, president of the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America.
The foundation is the largest voluntary nonprofit health organization dedicated to finding cures for inflammatory bowel diseases, a classification that includes Crohn's and colitis.
