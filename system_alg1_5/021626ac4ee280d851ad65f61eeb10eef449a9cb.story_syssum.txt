Of 2,501 tests carried out on beef products across the industry by noon Friday, 2,472 found no horse meat content above 1%, the UK Food Standards Agency said.
Investigations are ongoing, but authorities cannot rule out the possibility of arrests, it said.
The ready-made cottage pie, or shepherd's pie, came from an external supplier, the Lancashire County Council said.
Another major caterer, Gate Gourmet, is doing the same with its suppliers.
Over the past week, unauthorized horse meat has been discovered in a variety of products labeled as beef that were sold in supermarkets in countries including Britain, France, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany and Ireland.
"The analysis tells us that the lasagnas contained 60% or more horse meat," a spokeswoman said.
The other firm, Spanghero, should have known that the meat it labeled as beef was actually horse, French Consumer Affairs Minister Benoit Hamon said.
"The company has never ordered horse meat and we never knowingly sold horse meat," the representative said.
UK and French authorities are working to trace the horse meat, the Food Standards Agency said.
