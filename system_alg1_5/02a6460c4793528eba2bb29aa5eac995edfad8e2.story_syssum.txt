United will next face either defending European champions Inter Milan or Schalke, who hold a 5-2 lead ahead of Wednesday's second leg in Germany.
"A lot of people thought Drogba would play," Ferguson told reporters.
Could be.
The home side, having survived some early scares, thought they had scored in the 27th minute when Hernandez stole in at the near post to head home Wayne Rooney's cross, but the Mexico international strayed marginally offside.
It was the 37-year-old Giggs' third assist of the quarterfinal, having also set up Rooney's first-leg winner.
The win kept United, the European runners-up in 2009, on course for a treble this season ahead of Saturday's FA Cup semifinal against local rivals Manchester City.
