The decision Tuesday is a blow for several states, the Obama administration and environmental groups, which had sought to prevent "upwind states" from emitting possibly unhealthy levels of contaminants across state borders, a requirement known as the "good neighbor" policy.
"EPA faults the states for not hitting that impossible-to-know target with their (State Implementation Plans) submissions," Kavanaugh said.
By the time EPA makes the target clear, it's already too late for the states to comply."
Under the Clean Air Act, the good neighbor provision requires upwind states to bear responsibility for what the appeals court said was their fair share of "the mess" in downwind states.
But Texas was among those states critical of the administration's new rules.
Lawsuits over those new rules have been filed.
