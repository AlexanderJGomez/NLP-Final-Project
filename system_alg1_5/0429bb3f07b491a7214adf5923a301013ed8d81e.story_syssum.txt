Economically speaking, Erdogan has delivered.
"Erdogan's 12 month strategy is to engineer, de jure or de facto, as much of a transfer of power from the prime minister's office to the presidential palace as he can," wrote Professor Henri Barkey of Lehigh University in Pennsylvania.
But after suffering through a year of intense protests, a barrage of accusations and investigations linked to corruption at the top of his government and a challenge from afar by former ally, the Pennsylvania based religious leader Fethullah Gulen, Erdogan not only seems undeterred, but more emboldened than ever.
This infrastructure, he says, will also help sustain growth.
It is not unusual for Erdogan to draw comparisons of his leadership to that of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey.
He wants to secure his place in history.
