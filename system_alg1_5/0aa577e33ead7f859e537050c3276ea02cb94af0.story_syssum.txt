For the opposition groups, Annan could spend all the time he wants on negotiations, but any talks not predicated on al-Assad's stepping aside will not be acceptable.
The bottom line is that the two main protagonists in the conflict look at the Annan plan as a means to achieve their respective, mutually exclusive objectives.
Al-Assad has not been able to crush the opposition, and opposition seems nowhere near to dislodging al-Assad.
Similarly, the opposition groups believe that if they stop now and al-Assad remains in power, he will hunt them down.
On the other hand, Russia's Syria policy seems to be in flux judging by its vote in the United Nations recently.
To date, only four of Syria's 14 governorates constitute the major hubs of the protest movement: Homs, Hama, Idlib and Daraa.
While the exile opposition remains divided, there are hopeful signs that the opposition ranks within Syria are becoming better organized, better trained and gaining legitimacy.
In the process, the leaders in these councils, who hail from Syria's different religious and ethnic groups, are developing political skills, cultivating local constituencies and learning through trial and error the business of governing.
