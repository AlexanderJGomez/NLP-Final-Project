I became hysterical," said Donnelly, 50.
"Everyone who received their pets started to cry," said Donnelly.
"Letting them know, 'We'll take care of your animal like it is our own,' it means the world to people."
Several years ago, Leary began working as a firefighter and American Red Cross volunteer.
said Leary, 36.
Now, whenever the Red Cross responds to a disaster and discovers that an animal is involved, they call Leary.
"I'm allowed into situations that other people might not be," Leary said.
They usually stay with Leary for a few days while they get vaccinated, spayed and neutered, if necessary.
"Food, cat litter, bowls, medicine, whatever they need," said Leary.
"I cried when we were reunited," said Donnelly.
For Leary, helping families and their pets is what her work is all about.
