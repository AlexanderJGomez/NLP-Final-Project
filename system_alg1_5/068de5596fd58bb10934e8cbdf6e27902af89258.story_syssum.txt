Law enforcement from Massachusetts and Florida as well as the FBI questioned Todashev at his Florida home.
"Florida officials are simply deferring to the FBI, allowing the FBI to investigate itself, but it is difficult to accept the FBI's honesty in this matter," Howard Simon, ACLU of Florida's executive director, said in a statement Monday.
A samurai sword was in the room when Todashev sat down with two Massachusetts State Police detectives and a Boston-based FBI agent, but it was moved out of his reach, the U.S. official said.
A law enforcement official told CNN that Todashev attacked the FBI agent with a broom handle, not a sword.
