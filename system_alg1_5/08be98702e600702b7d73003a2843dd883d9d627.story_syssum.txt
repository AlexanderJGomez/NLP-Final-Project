But on reflection, the abbey is the most obvious and perfect venue.
Since then, Westminster Abbey has ruled supreme as the ultimate royal venue.
But inevitably, in the modern world, Westminster Abbey is inextricably linked to the funeral of Princess Diana, and this is the reason many considered it an inappropriate venue for William and Kate's wedding.
When William brought Kate out to face the world's press last week, standing together as equals, so obviously in love, you could see how successful Charles and Diana have been.
The queen now reigns over a multiracial, multifaith, multiethnic population.
Some may scoff, but it is interesting how fast the front pages of the world's newspapers and the schedules of the news channels were cleared once the official announcement was made last week; proving yet again that the House of Windsor is the longest-running, and best-loved, news story of them all.
