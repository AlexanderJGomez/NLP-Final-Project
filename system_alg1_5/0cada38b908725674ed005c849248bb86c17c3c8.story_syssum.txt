The woman, who was pulled out Friday from the remains of the garment factory, was found in that pool of water, rescue official Lt. Col. Moazzem Hossain told CNN.
In addition, "having some access to water must have happened here," he noted.
Water may have trickled to the building's basement, where Reshma was found, from recent rains and from water sprayed by rescuers.
Also, Reshma's youth may have worked in her favor, he said.
"My guess is, she's extremely weak," he said.
