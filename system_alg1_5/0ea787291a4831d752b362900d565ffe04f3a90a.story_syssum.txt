The Argentine forward's 60th minute goal -- courtesy of his trusty left boot -- doubled the league leaders' lead after Xavi had opened the scoring two minutes before halftime.
Real Madrid crashed to their fourth league defeat of the season at Malaga.
But two goals in three minutes from substitute Roque Santa Cruz consigned Madrid to defeat.
The win takes Malaga -- who have been banned from playing in UEFA club competitions next season after falling foul of the European governing body's Financial Fair Play regulations -- to within two points of third-placed Madrid.
