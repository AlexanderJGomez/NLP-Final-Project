Mayflower, Arkansas (CNN) -- Janet Copeland and her husband, Richard, both say they agree almost all the time, with one exception: The Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's health care legislation.
"I did not like the way it was shoved down our throats," Richard responds.
According to Families USA, a liberal-leaning health insurance advocacy group, Janet Copeland's situation is common.
But Janet, who is quickly using up her life savings to pay her monthly health premium, is fully supportive of Obamacare, and supports Democratic President Barack Obama in his re-election bid.
Janet raised two children, maintained the house, and painted portraits and landscapes on the side.
"I held one job during my marriage, working as an art instructor," Janet says.
"Then I got married, and the whole thing changed," Janet says.
"It won't last me for a lifetime, I think, but right now, my insurance is taken care of."
"A family's health insurance rate can change for a variety of reasons, both a birth in the family, a death in the family, a divorce," says Wright.
Wright says Janet Copeland could benefit from some of the provisions of the Affordable Health Care act, like the expansion of Medicaid.
Yet, it's unclear how those provisions will be applied in the Copeland's home state of Arkansas.
Perry, like Richard Copeland, also disagrees with the health care law on philosophical grounds.
From a health care perspective, Wright says this election is "the most important" in U.S. history.
Life is better with someone you love."
