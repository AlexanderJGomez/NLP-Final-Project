The police offered "a further unreserved apology" for the death of de Menezes in 2005, plus an undisclosed compensation package, the police and the de Menezes family said in a joint statement.
They also found that de Menezes did not advance toward armed officers on the subway train, which would have given them a reason to shoot.
De Menezes was killed July 22, 2005, a day after four failed bombings aboard the London transit system.
Officers staking out a home in south London saw and followed de Menezes, 27, believing he was one of the suspects.
