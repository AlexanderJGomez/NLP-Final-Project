Simoncelli, 24, had his helmet knocked off in the crash and he lay motionless on the track.
The race was abandoned and Simoncelli was given emergency treatment at the track's medical center, but it was to no avail.
Rossi, a seven-time world champion in motorcycling's elite category, left the track devastated by the accident involving his fellow Italian and "good friend" Simoncelli.
The Italian sports community was left stunned by Simoncelli's death and a minute's silence was held at all major events, including Serie A football games.
