"If the world continues to watch, then the massacre of Hama in the '80s will be repeated," said Hamdo, referring to 1982, when Syria's military -- acting under orders from current President Bashar al-Assad's father, Hafez al-Assad -- launched an assault on the city, killing thousands.
"There is no electricity, water, or communication whatsoever now and the communication breakdown has extended even closer to the Turkish border," he said.
"All shops were closed on all main roads in the city," the group said.
Five of the dead were children, the group said.
Authorities also chased another "armed gang" and killed two of its members, SANA said.
There were clashes Saturday in Khan Sheikhon, where authorities "arrested a number of the terrorists and killed three of those groups' prominent leaders," SANA said in a report Sunday.
Residents said members of Syria's 12th Armored Brigade, which is based near the border with Jordan, "stormed" Busra al-Harir.
On Saturday, France expressed its concerns about events in Syria, and warned against Syria launching a military operation against the city of Homs and its population, the French Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Israeli President Shimon Peres on Sunday described Syrian President al-Assad as a "killer," implicitly comparing him to Libya's ousted ruler Moammar Gadhafi.
Al-Assad has been in power since 2000; his father, Hafez, ruled Syria for three decades.
