But for Romney, the problem is that as the polls go up and down each week, there is one constant: As Real Clear Politics demonstrates in its averaging process, Obama stays ahead and has been for nearly a year.
Translated, that means he has to score a convincing victory in the eyes of voters.
So, yes, Romney can still win, but it will be darn hard.
But on closer examination, Obama ought to be pressing for a victory, too.
If he wins big, he can persuasively argue that the American people have spoken loudly and clearly, choosing his path into the future over Romney's.
At minimum, he will claim a mandate in favor of higher taxes on the affluent, a strong safety net for those in trouble and a cautious approach toward reducing Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security costs.
In short, Obama has a great deal riding on Wednesday's debate, too.
Members of his team may talk as if they have less at stake than their opponent, but in their hearts, they know that if Obama can put Romney away in their first debate, he could well have some lightning at his command in a second term.
