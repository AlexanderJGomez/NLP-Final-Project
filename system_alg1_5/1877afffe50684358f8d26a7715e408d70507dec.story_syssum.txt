(CNN) -- Gunmen on a motorbike killed a Russian military instructor and wounded a second Tuesday in Yemen's capital of Sanaa, two senior police officials said.
The two victims were advising Yemen's army as private security contractors, said the police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Last week, one of their representatives in Yemen's parliament was shot dead by gunmen on a motorcycle in Sanaa.
With the help of drone strikes allegedly carried out by the CIA, Yemen's military put militants in the country's tribal region on retreat last year, but AQAP regularly carries out terrorist attacks on soldiers and officials.
