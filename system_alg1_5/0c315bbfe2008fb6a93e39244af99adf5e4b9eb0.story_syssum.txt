In a tight Premier League opener against Southampton, the attacking talents who still remain at Anfield proved last season's runners-up still have bite, despite the departure of English football's least favorite Uruguayan.
But after Southampton equalized in the second half, it was Suarez's former strike partner Daniel Sturridge who made the decisive contribution.
If Sturridge and Sterling keep firing, memories of Suarez will fade fast.
Not everyone is convinced, though.
A host of celebrities have soaked themselves in icy cold water, and Ronaldo joined the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Justin Timberlake and Conan O'Brien after being nominated by former Manchester United teammate Darren Fletcher.
More worryingly Saturday's defeat highlighted the lack of investment in United's squad over the last few years, a legacy bequeathed to former manager David Moyes by his predecessor Alex Ferguson.
After finishing second last season, Monaco is without a point after two games and Sunday's 4-1 defeat at Bordeaux illustrates Ligue 1's noveau riche club might struggle without James Rodriguez, who joined Real Madrid in the summer.
France's Professional Football League disciplinary committee is due to examine the incident on Thursday and, given the severity of the "biting" sanction handed out to Luis Suarez by world governing body FIFA, it will be interesting to what the French regulator does.
