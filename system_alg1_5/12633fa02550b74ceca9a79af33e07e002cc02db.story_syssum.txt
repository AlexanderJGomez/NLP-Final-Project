According to a press release from Showtime, "Twin Peaks" will be a limited series of nine episodes.
When it debuted, "Twin Peaks" was like nothing else that had ever aired on television.
"Twin Peaks" started off a huge hit, but as the plot became more obscure and the mood became darker, the audience dwindled, especially in the second season.
Showtime plans to show the entire run of the TV series before the premiere of the new "Twin Peaks" episodes.
"To quote Agent Cooper, 'I have no idea where this will lead us, but I have a definite feeling it will be a place both wonderful and strange.'"
