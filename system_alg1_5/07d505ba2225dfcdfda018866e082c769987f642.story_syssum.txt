Both men were hospitalized and expected to survive, according to David Peterka, who was part of the film crew, but was not aboard the plane.
A flight engineer, whose name was not released, was critically injured and was in a coma, Peterka said.
Just before the plane crashed, the listening devices went off and they could not communicate with the pilot, Peterka said.
"Before the plane crashed, witnesses said it was flying unusually low," said Francis Mwaka, a Kenyan federal communications official.
