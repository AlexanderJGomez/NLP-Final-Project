Receivers dotted around five major cities, including Mexico City and Acapulco, will sound the alarm if they detect an earthquake.
Most receivers are stationed in the likes of public buildings, hospitals, schools and subway stations.
"Until you live in one of these places you don't really understand the primitive fear of earthquakes," he said.
When seismic activity is detected, the Grillo sounds a loud, flashing alarm.
Meira also hopes versions of the Grillo system could be introduced elsewhere in the world where earthquakes are a real risk -- like in Nepal, India, the West Coast of the U.S. and along much of the Pacific Coast of South America.
"People should know that the safest thing to do is to stay in the stadium," he said.
"The real test of a good infrastructure is the density of sensors," Meira said.
For now, however, this fledgling group's focus remains on Mexico.
"The science is all there," he said.
Now, they await the next earthquake.
