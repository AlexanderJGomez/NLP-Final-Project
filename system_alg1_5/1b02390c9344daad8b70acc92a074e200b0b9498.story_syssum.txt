(CNN) -- When Ann Arbor, Michigan, advertising executive Al McWilliams finished high school in the late 1990s, he made a vow.
"I don't have to worry about a car, where it's parked, gas or maintenance."
Trips in 2012 on U.S. subways, commuter trains, light rail, trolleys and buses beat the previous year by 1.5% -- or about 154.3 million rides.
Well, several things, say experts.
They could call friends, read books, chat with other commuters.
So they kept on riding, even as gas prices dropped.
Last year, voters approved nearly 80% of the nation's local and state transit funding initiatives, the American Public Transportation Association said, allowing their tax money to go toward public transportation systems.
Plans call for Phoenix light rail to expand to 57 miles by 2026 at the earliest, depending on the economy.
This year, two more light rail lines are expected to open for business.
Millennials, age 18 to 34, like McWilliams are more likely to use public transit than older Americans, according to surveys.
