According to the Durango State's Attorney's Office, the bodies were found in a residential area in the capital city of the same name.
The grisly discovery comes in the same week that authorities in Tamaulipas, a Mexican state that shares a border with Texas, confirmed they have so far found 116 bodies in multiple mass graves.
According to officials, Estrada is a presumed leader of Los Zetas.
Another 72 bodies were found in San Fernando last August.
