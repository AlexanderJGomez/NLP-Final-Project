That is wrong.
Guess again.
Twice this week, the Senate has opened debate with its party leaders engaged in a caustic battle over Reid's plans to seek changes to Senate rules in January.
Reform of the Senate is overdue.
Because Senate rules deem this motion "debatable," it takes 60 votes to cut off debate and come to a vote on the motion.
Similarly, debate could be trimmed by banning filibusters on the three steps required to send a bill to conference with the House.
The first cloture vote would require 60 votes, as is required under Senate rules.
For executive branch appointees, the fast track might fix the length of Senate consideration, guaranteeing a confirmation vote within, say, three months.
If the White House nominates a candidate approved by such a commission, the Senate would fast-track the nominee to a confirmation vote.
Because changes to Senate rules can be filibustered, efforts to reform the Senate typically crash and burn.
But as this week's outrage on the Senate floor suggests, the process of an overhaul can be as explosive as the actual reform.
