"Secretary Shinseki has dedicated his life to his fellow veterans, and nobody is more committed to completing the work that lies ahead," said a VA statement by Drew Brookie, VA spokesman.
"As the secretary says, providing veterans the quality care and benefits they have earned through their service is our only mission at VA."
Many of the veterans, the doctor and other VA sources told CNN, were placed on a secret list created by VA managers to hide the wait times of veterans seeking medical care.
The director of health care at the U.S. Government Accountability Office, Congress' watchdog organization, told CNN on Monday that even the VA does not truly know how many American veterans are waiting for care across the country.
The VA reported that in just the last year, it basically cleared 1.5 million backlogged orders of patient care or services, which they call consults, but Draper said there is no way of knowing why they were closed.
"The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) takes any allegations about patient care or employee misconduct very seriously.
Veterans deserve to have full faith in their VA care.
As America's largest veterans organization, their moral authority on this issue is unimpeachable.
