But his closest competitor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, has not conceded.
On the local level, there may not be many differences between today's PRI and the political party that dominated Mexico for decades, said Andrew Selee, director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

He is a young, outgoing personality," said Cuellar, who describes Peña Nieto as a friend and flew to Mexico City over the weekend to support the candidate.

"I am convinced that in terms of security, we need to adjust the policy to keep confronting organized crime, criminal gangs and cartel chiefs head-on," Peña Nieto told CNN en Español Monday.
In a congressional hearing last month, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner said the war on drugs was nearing a "potential crossroad," referring to Peña Nieto's plan and his party's political history.
Changing strategies in dealing with drug violence, Cuellar said, doesn't mean stopping the battle.
"In the end, I don't think he will do many things differently than Calderon, because there isn't much that can be done differently," Chabat said.
In speeches, it sounds really great to say that you're going to do things differently, but there won't be many changes."
