Apparently, the one he and his Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, or LDP, claimed less than two years ago wasn't enough.
Abe put economic rejuvenation at the top of his policy agenda, seeking to end two-plus "lost decades" to both consolidate political support and, perhaps even more significantly, to provide the foundation for a more robust international role.
For the vast majority of Japanese voters, support for the LDP stemmed from the prospect of economic revival, and they were prepared to swallow parts of Abe's security agenda if that was part of the package.
The LDP contains a spectrum of political positions, and if the party has a center, it is left of the current government's views.
Yet opinion polls show the LDP increasing its share of seats in the parliament, despite dropping approval ratings for the Cabinet and Abe.
Not surprisingly, support for the DPJ, still the largest opposition party, today hovers around 10%; 37% of voters say they will back the LDP in this month's vote.
This is how Abe and company, despite increasing unpopularity, increase seats in an election.
In this case, the Abe government is threatened by the failure of its own policies, not a real opposition.
If he does, the Prime Minister will simply end up undermining whatever mandate he will claim after this week's ballot.
