The three-member panel, headed by former defense chief Marshal Houston, made 22 recommendations Monday on how the country should deal with thousands of asylum seekers who attempt to reach its shores each year.
Refugee Convention, Malaysia has no legal obligation to protect asylum seekers, something required under Australia's Migration Act.
Refugee advocates reacted with outrage to the report, calling it a "rebadging of the Pacific Solution," a reference to the former Liberal government's controversial policy of the last decade.
There are no simple solutions," he added.
Between late 2001 and June this year, 964 asylum seekers and crew died at sea.
"The 'Pacific Solution' was a failed policy, and a wildly expensive one, that was internationally condemned for breaching the human rights of some of the world's most vulnerable people," he added.
"Although Nauru and PNG have signed the Refugee Convention, neither country has its own laws in place to protect refugees nor are there any proper legal guarantees that refugees would be protected, and there are serious concerns about human rights conditions on the ground," he said.
The panel estimated that if all the report's recommendations were adopted, they would cost US$1 billion to implement.
