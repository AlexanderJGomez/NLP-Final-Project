The Google Maps app held the top position until October, when Apple rolled out its latest mobile operating system, iOS 6, and replaced the built-in Google Maps app with its own, less accurate version.
The social network's app was the single largest, single app time suck, accounting for 23% of the time people spend using mobile apps, according to comScore.
Google's app with the most engagement was Gmail, but in total 10% of users' time was spent across various Google apps.
After Maps, Google Play, Google Search, Gmail and YouTube were the top apps on Android and iOS devices in December.
