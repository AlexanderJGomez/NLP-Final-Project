The fact is, Miami is no longer the same city as the one portrayed in the 1980s cop show.
The mid 80s was the Miami Vice era, when the city's reputation for glamour and hedonism came with a side order of carjackings and gangland shootouts.
Miami has acquired a reputation as the new kid on the block in the modern art scene, a reputation that was cemented when the world's most prestigious modern art fair, Art Basel, arrived in the city in 2002.
The food, music, culture and language of Latin America have all become part of modern Miami, giving the city a cultural heritage that belies its youth.
In truth, there's still a touch of the old Vice about Miami, and who knows, with the 80s revival, we may not have seen the last of those white suits.
