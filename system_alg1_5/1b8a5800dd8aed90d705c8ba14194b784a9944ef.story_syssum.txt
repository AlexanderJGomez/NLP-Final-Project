Zenani Mandela, 13, was buried in a private ceremony earlier in the day, Mandela's office said, after she was killed in a car crash June 11.
Mandela, who did much to bring the tournament to his country, skipped the World Cup kickoff, which came only hours after Zenani died.
"She was a precious little girl who shined bright for everyone to see," he said, choking up, the foundation said.
Mandela, who is 91, has limited his public appearances recently, although he did meet the South Africa soccer squad before the World Cup began.
