(CNN) -- Michael Schumacher, the most successful driver in Formula 1 history and one of the world's highest-profile athletes, remains in critical condition after suffering severe head trauma in a skiing accident in the French Alps, hospital officials said Monday.
Schumacher, who turns 45 Friday, won a record seven world titles in his spectacular Formula 1 career and "also holds nearly every scoring record in the book by a considerable margin," according to the motorsport's official website.
The cause of the accident, which is being investigated by police, remains unclear, Gernignon-Lecomte said.
But nobody else was involved, she said.
Schumacher has a wife, Corinna, and two children, Gina-Maria and Mick.
"If you are anything less than a really experienced skier, it's very easy to lose your bearings, because you don't see much in the way of vegetation around you or anything else," said Paul Hochman, a former contributing editor at SKI Magazine.
"Schumacher wasn't a skier when he joined Ferrari (in 1996), but by the end he was excellent," he said.
"But he was always very mindful of the danger around him," Garside added.
