Plan B, also called the morning-after pill, is intended to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex.
On March 23, a federal court ordered that Plan B, an emergency contraception pill, be made available over the counter to those 17 and older, the agency said in a statement on its Web site.
In August 2006, the FDA approved the sale of Plan B without a prescription to those 18 and older, but those 17 and under needed a prescription to obtain it.
"Indeed, the record shows that FDA officials and staff both agreed that 17-year-olds can use Plan B safely without a prescription.
Some critics charge that the drug's action amounts to an abortion, and opposed making it available over the counter.
But now the FDA is making the drug available to minors without parental consent," the Concerned Women for America, a Washington-based conservative Christian group, said Wednesday.
"Parents should be furious that the FDA is putting their minor daughters at risk," the group said.
