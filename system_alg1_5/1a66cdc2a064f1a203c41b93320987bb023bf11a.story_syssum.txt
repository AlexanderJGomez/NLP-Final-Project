"We are not interested in the US market any more," Eric Xu, executive vice-president, said at the company's annual analyst summit on Tuesday.
In October, a US congressional report officially branded Huawei and ZTE, its smaller Chinese peer, a threat to national security.
In 2008, Huawei retracted a bid for 3Com, a US technology company, after it emerged that the proposed deal would not gain regulatory approval in Washington.
But October's congressional report made it even more difficult for the company to do business in the US, Huawei executives say.
William Xu, the unit's chief executive, said its goal of generating $15bn in revenues from the business by 2017 -- a target set just last year -- was "too optimistic".
