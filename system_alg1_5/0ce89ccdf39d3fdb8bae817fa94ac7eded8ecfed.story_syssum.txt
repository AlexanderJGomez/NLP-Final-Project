Zimmerman was required to return to central Florida and turn himself in after a judge revoked his bail Friday, saying Zimmerman misled the court about his finances.
Zimmerman's cell is designed to hold two inmates and is about 67 square feet, the sheriff's office said.
"While out on bond, Mr. Zimmerman has been living in a secure, undisclosed location as there are significant threats against his life," his attorneys said Sunday on the official website for his defense.
His family has said Zimmerman did not act out of racial bias.
Furthermore, the vast majority of the funds in question are in an independently managed trust" which Zimmerman and his attorneys cannot access directly, the statement on his defense website said.
Asked about the possibility that Zimmerman's wife could be charged with perjury, O'Mara said that statement was out of his control.
Zimmerman "fully controlled and participated in the transfer of money from the PayPal account to defendant and his wife's credit union accounts," Corey said in court records.
The judge "relied on false representations and statements" by Zimmerman and his wife when the court set his bond at $150,000, Corey said.
O'Mara said he had discussed the judge's decision with Zimmerman, who was not in court.
