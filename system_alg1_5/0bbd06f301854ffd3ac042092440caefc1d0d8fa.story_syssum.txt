"He disappeared with his car."
"No one's seen him," the woman replies.
After the incident, Turkish authorities separated Sidika Platin and her children from her husband and placed them in a state-run women's shelter.
"At that time, because he showed regret and because his [criminal] record was clean, his sentence was postponed," said Meral Demirbas, the governor of Saray district where Kapikoy is located.
"There are thousands of women like Sidika out here."
That is because women are not willing to tell about the violence, it's a very sensitive issue," says Pinar Ilkkaracan, a co-founder of the Istanbul-based group Women for Women's Human Rights.
"The law prohibits violence against women, including spousal abuse, but the government did not effectively enforce it," the U.S. State Department said in its 2009 human rights report on Turkey.
"There is a lack of coordinated action and strong will on the part of the government to stop violence against women," says Ilkkaracan.
Niyazi Yakin, a member of the Kapikoy village council and a relative of Faruk Platin, says he personally asked Sidika if she was being abused, and she said no.
"She deserved what happened," Yakin said.
"It looked as if she had been tortured," one Van hospital doctor told CNN, on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to give an interview.
"The state is guilty, the system is guilty," she says.
"When there is violence, it doesn't matter if it's your relative," Yeni responds.
"You can still make a call and inform that this woman is being beaten."
