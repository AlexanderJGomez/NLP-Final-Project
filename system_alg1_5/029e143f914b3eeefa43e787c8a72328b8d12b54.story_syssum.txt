"Terrorism has no place in Africa; it has no place in the developing world," he said.
The Al-Shabaab militant group, which is currently battling the weak transitional government in war-torn Somalia, claimed responsibility for the bombings, saying they were in retaliation for Uganda's contribution of troops for peacekeeping operations in Somalia.
"While people were enjoying the World Cup, Uganda was having the dark side of it," Jonathan told the conference.
"We welcome the pledges of other countries in providing the troops to Somalia, including from Djibouti, which already has a battalion ready."
"We are seeing real commitment, with more countries contributing to the AU peacekeeping mission in Somalia."
Some 20 people have been arrested in connection with the Kampala blasts, Ugandan leader Yoweri Museveni told the summit, and have been giving investigators "useful" information about terrorist operations.
"I have great contempt for the authors of terrorism," he told the summit.
Museveni told the summit the mandate of the AU peacekeeping mission in Somalia should be changed, with troops able to beyond Mogadishu and hunt Al-Shabaab and other militant groups.
Museveni said.
