For the first time in 25 years, the state of Massachusetts has an open Senate seat.
Kennedy won his Senate seat in 1962; John Kerry won his in 1984.
Gov.
Rep. Ed Markey, a 17-term congressman from north of Boston, ran for Kerry's Senate seat in 1984.
There wasn't a serious threat to Markey's House seat, but he wanted to raise his profile in the event of a Senate vacancy created by a Kerry presidential win over George W. Bush, Mayer said.
Rep. Mike Capuano, now in his sixth term from Somerville, currently has the seat once held by President Kennedy and House Speaker Tip O'Neill.
Massachusetts Democrats might, however, decide it's time to turn the political page by sending a woman to the U.S. Senate.
But the most famous name in Massachusetts politics is, of course, Kennedy.
The nephew of Ted Kennedy and son of Robert F. Kennedy, he currently heads Citizens Energy Corp., which provides home heating fuel for low-income Americans.
