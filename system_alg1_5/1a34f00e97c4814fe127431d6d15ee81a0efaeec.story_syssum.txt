Clinton will headline her first public campaign rally next Thursday, when she travels to Philadelphia to stump for Tom Wolf, Pennsylvania Democratic gubernatorial nominee.
Clinton will also headline events and fundraisers for Democratic senate candidates in Kentucky, Iowa, New Hampshire, Georgia, North Carolina and Colorado, according to a Democratic source.
Hillary Clinton, according to Erik Dorey, Pryor's campaign spokesman, will not attend those events but will host a fundraiser for the senator in New York next week.
Clinton's trip to New Hampshire will be Nov. 2, a Democratic source in the state tells CNN.
On Thursday, Clinton was in Florida to stump for Charlie Crist.
