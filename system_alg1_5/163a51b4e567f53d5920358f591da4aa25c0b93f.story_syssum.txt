Ishant Sharma gave India early breakthroughs in the morning, Virender Sehwag and Zaheer Khan chipped in with vital wickets and Amit Mishra completed a four-wicket haul as India cantered to victory with a session to spare.
Victory for India then seemed a foregone conclusion when Raqibul Hasan, who suffered a painful rap on the elbow, was trapped in front by Ishant with a delivery that nipped in.
With an attacking field in place, runs were there for the taking and Mushfiqur cashed in, reaching his maiden century with a straight-driven boundary off Mishra, his 17th boundary.
Mishra, however, brought up victory by prising out Mushfiqur, the wicketkeeper-batsman lofting the bowler over the top, but only finding the fielder at long-off.
