Cartagena, Colombia (CNN) -- When a 12-day-old boy died in her arms, Catalina Escobar was devastated.
"It was agony," said Escobar.
I took action."
From the start, Escobar noticed that 70% of the mothers she was working with were between the ages of 14 and 16.
... Next year, she's going to be pregnant again," Escobar said.
Escobar is hoping to change that through her teen mothers program, which aims to teach young women how to support themselves and their children.
For Escobar, that's the whole point.
For the first year, young mothers come to the center every weekday, leaving their babies at the daycare while they attend classes.
They think it's from a kiss," Escobar said.
The teens also make and sell products at the center's bakery, which helps fund the program, and the foundation offers micro-loans to help them start their own businesses.
"I want my girls to be empowered," she said.
"I feel great, since I was able to accomplish a goal that I had wanted," Bautista said.
"It is better to go forward with my future, to not just sit around like other girls," she said.
"These teen mothers are my own daughters," Escobar said.
In the coming years, she is hoping to expand her program throughout Colombia.
... We are changing the lives of these girls," Escobar said.
