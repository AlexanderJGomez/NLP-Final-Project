The discovery of 100 new plants, 28 fish, 18 reptiles, 14 amphibians, two mammals and one bird species highlights the extent of the biodiversity in the region, said Barney Long, head of the WWF's Asian Species Conservation program.
It shows how little we know about species in the region," he said.
Globally, new species of mammals are rare finds, but in 2008 alone, new species of the mouselike musk shrew and a tube-nosed bat emerged from the region.
"As we become familiar with more species in the region, our understanding of climate change and how it impacts these new species is changing," she said.
Apart from climate change, construction of dams and hydropower plants along the delta could further disrupt its waters, potentially displacing millions, destroying sources of drinkable water and disrupting the production of rice, Chungyalpa said.
"Climate change is making it obvious that we can't treat development like it's a separate issue," she said.
It's such an immediate issue for us and it's going to change everything in this region if we don't address it."
