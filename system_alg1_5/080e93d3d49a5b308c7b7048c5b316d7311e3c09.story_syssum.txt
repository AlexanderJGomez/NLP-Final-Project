Contrary to popular perception, aid is not one homogenous entity or a single transfer of money from donor to recipient countries.
Most of this is food aid, which is used to tackle acute hunger -- but even this form of aid is not without controversy.
Research demonstrates that food aid can be poor value for money, especially when food grown in donor countries is shipped to the developing world.
As important as these expenditures may be, they do not result in any transfer of resources to developing nations.
These schemes may of course be beneficial to recipient countries in the long term -- for example, contributing to capacity development if students return to their countries.
Now, for the first time ever, we can see just how much aid flows between specific countries and, crucially, what that aid consists of.
But almost 70% of Italy's aid stayed in the country, spent on refugee costs and debt relief, whereas around 70% of Denmark's aid resulted in a transfer of resources to developing countries.
Without the support of international aid, most poor people will be left behind.
If we want to maximize the impact and reach of international aid, we need to ensure that every dollar is spent as efficiently as possible.
