For while this little, butterfly-shaped gland at the base of our neck, weighing in at barely an ounce, seems both delicate and innocuous, when not in hormonally balanced harmony, it packs a wallop.
"Our thyroid, even though it's a small gland in your neck, controls everything," says endocrinologist Karen Smith.
"There is actually an acronym that we use for hypothyroidism," she said.
The condition is lifelong, or as Smith puts it, "from the cradle to the rocking chair."
I tell my patients, it's like a forest fire in California, burning everything up, "explains Smith, who just recently found out she suffered from this issue.
"My first symptoms were irritability, feeling tired and blue.
Smith, who is doing much better now, details the options.
"There are actually three ways to treat it," Smith said.
"It's a substance that when you give it, it will actually damage the thyroid to help put out the fire, so to speak, to put out the flame of the overactive gland."
If she was right and it was not just an overactive hand-to-mouth cake thing, then I better call my doctor pronto to schedule my own test.
