We spoke to Josh McDermitt, who plays Eugene, about his time on "The Walking Dead" and what might be next for the character (that is, assuming he's OK after being beaten up by Michael Cudlitz's Abraham).
I was like, wow, I didn't expect it to come that quick.
It's a scary place.
McDermitt: It's not just that, it's the relationship he has with Rosita and Tara.
There's a little bit of hope for Eugene, but at this point he's a broken man, starting over.
I had to put it down for a while, because I was afraid I would influence it too much.
McDermitt: At this moment, they're still together.
We'll see how the damage is repaired, and it's not pretty, I'll tell you that.
