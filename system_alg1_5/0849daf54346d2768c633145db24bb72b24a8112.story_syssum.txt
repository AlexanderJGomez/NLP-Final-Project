(CNN) -- Federal terrorism charges against Boston Marathon bombings suspect Dzhokar Tsarnaev could be filed soon, even as he remains hospitalized, a Justice Department official told CNN on Saturday.
"There are still many unanswered questions," Obama said Friday night.
Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, are accused of setting off bombs at the marathon Monday, killing three people and wounding more than 170.
"He will not get bail obviously," said senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin.
But this is not an ordinary case, say U.S. Sens.
But Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Saturday that the suspect should not be held as an enemy combatant.
"Impossible.
"The police have said there's no public safety issue; it's solved, it's over," Dershowitz said.
"You would have to know the internals of what they have before you can assess whether there is a sensible invocation or not," Giuliani said.
Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was not a U.S. citizen, traveled to Sheremetyevo, Russia, in January 2012, according to travel records provided by a U.S. official.
"If he says my intent was to please my brother, they could raise the question of federal jurisdiction," Dershowitz said.
Russia's investigative committee in Dagestan said it will not engage with the Tsarnaev family unless there is "an order from above" to do so, spokesman Rasul Temerbekov told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti on Saturday.
