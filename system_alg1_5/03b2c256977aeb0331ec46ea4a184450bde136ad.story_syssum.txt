The last few years have seen a growing shift in the way men are perceived, under the collective weight of celebrity bad boys, stay-at-home dads, written scholarship on the supposed "end of men," an epidemic of male incarceration, two decade-long wars fought mostly by men and a nascent men's movement that is not about proclaiming male power but male capacity for depth and goodness.
Historically, rape has been viewed narrowly as a crime against women.
But in fact they do.
Buck up, things happen.
Without acknowledgement that rape of men exists, there is less help and support for them to overcome the trauma.
Clearly, there are still far more women who are raped than men.
For men to be thinking hard about how to be better fathers and husbands can only benefit women, as can the acknowledgment that men are all too often victims of rape.
