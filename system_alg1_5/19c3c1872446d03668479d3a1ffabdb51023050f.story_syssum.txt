No one should believe, however, that simply replacing the secretary with a new person will solve the Veterans Administration's problems.
The VA is a classic example of the principle W. Edwards Deming, the father of the quality movement, was trying to communicate with his red bead experiment.
The ATM is a good example.
There are no business hours involved.
The VA treats some six million veterans a year at more than 1,400 different sites including hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, etc.
The scale of VA bureaucracy has grown dramatically.
At VA facilities, veterans wait twice that time on average and that understates the problem in especially mismanaged sites.
That is a systems problem, not a scapegoat problem.
Every effort to integrate Department of Defense and VA medical record systems has failed.
In other words, even though military health costs are growing rapidly and taking up more and more of the DoD budget, the Department is failing to modernize its system and to integrate it with the VA.
Sadly, this dysfunction is not new.
Appropriately, Forbes wound up in jail for this corruption.
