Zhuhai, Guangdong Province (CNN)Zhuhai's Air Show has always been a venue for surprises, usually first-time showings of advanced Chinese military hardware.
Getting inside of the enemy's "decision loop" is the key to victory.
The FC-31's "Big Brother," the Chengdu J-20, first flew in January 2011 but has been shrouded in secrecy ever since.
Like other PLAAF fighter aircraft, the FC-31 is powered by Russian-made jet engines, in this case two Klimov RD-93 models, which are a specialized variant of the same engine that powers the famous Mikoyan "MiG-29."
Western aerospace analysts point out that the FC-31 flown at Zhuhai is a "clean" jet in that it is not armed, which means that an aircraft configured for a real mission and fitted with weapons would be even heavier and would perform even worse.
Unfortunately for the PLA, the gesture falls flat.
Looks can be deceiving, as they say.
