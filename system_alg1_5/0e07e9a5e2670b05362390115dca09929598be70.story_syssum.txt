Dubai, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- If you look at Dubai, there is the modern side and the traditional side, but they all interact with each other.
It is part of who I am.
I try and look for traditional materials.
And I would say, "Yeah."
I was an artist-in-residence in 2012.
My mum would get fabrics and I think this was where my interest in art and colors started.
But right now instead of having fabrics on that barrow, it has got an art piece on it made out of cardboard tubes.
I called it Prayer on a Wheel.
It is less challenging when you are a woman because they always think that art is your feminine side.
I would love to do this one day.
