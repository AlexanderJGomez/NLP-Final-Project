Contrary to Israel's rhetoric, the fear of Iran getting a nuclear weapon has not been the driving factor of Israel policy on Iran since the early 1990s.
Iran has hegemonic aspirations, Israel contends, and must be stopped, not accommodated.
The U.S.-Iran enmity has ensured Washington's commitment to isolating and containing Iran, much to Israel's satisfaction.
When Netanyahu was first elected prime minister, he requested an intelligence assessment of Israel's security environment.
Ultimately, Israel was successful at turning the world's focus towards Iran's nuclear activities.
But over the course of the past 18 months, the Netanyahu government has made Iran all about Israel.
For instance, when U.S. President Bill Clinton started sending strong signals to Iran's newly elected reformist president Mohammad Khatami in the late 1990s, then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak softened Israel's tone towards Iran in order to minimize any negative side-effects of a U.S.-Iran deal for Israel.
The more Netanyahu has sought to undermine the talks, the more Israel has lost its ability to impact the negotiations.
His only remaining options is to double down on opposing a nuclear deal with Iran, even at the cost of an open war with the American president, of damaging U.S.-Israel relations beyond Obama, and of making Israel a partisan issue.
