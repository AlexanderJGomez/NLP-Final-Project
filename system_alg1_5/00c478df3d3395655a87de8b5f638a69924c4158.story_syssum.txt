"It wasn't mom," Kondvar said.
Other than a pacemaker and a right hip replacement, Kondvar said, her mother was in good health and very active.
She was full of life," Kondvar said.
The body that arrived in a casket at the New Jersey funeral home on December 6 was not her mother, Kondvar said.
"It pains me that she's gone, and it's even worse because I don't have her and I want to hold her one more time, and I can't do that," Kondvar said.
That never happened, Kondvar said.
"If it is mom up in Canada, we want her back.
"It's a nightmare," Unruh said.
"If it's not her, I don't know where that leaves us," she said.
But Kondvar is wary.
That's why it brings me some kind of peace, is that she died in paradise," Kondvar said.
