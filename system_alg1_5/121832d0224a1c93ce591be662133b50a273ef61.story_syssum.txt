After all, football is almost a religion there.
The atmosphere felt like a family reunion, with hugs, jokes and lots of football talk.
We headed onto the field with my cameraman to do some filming.
As they settled back to watch the game, my cameraman and I got ready to shoot the start of it.
Canales and the Gridiron Heroes were thoroughly enjoying the game.
In the middle of the third quarter, the announcer gave a shout-out to the group, and fans around the stadium applauded.
The game ended, and we headed onto the field, which was swarmed with players, coaches, fans and the media.
Being at that game that day made me remember why I liked football, although watching it alongside Canales and his Gridiron Heroes was a powerful reminder of the game's risks.
