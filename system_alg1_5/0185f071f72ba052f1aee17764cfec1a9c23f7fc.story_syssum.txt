"I am what you call a matchmaker," Rosenbaum is quoted as saying at a July 13 meeting with the two undercover agents.
At that meeting, the complaint alleges, Rosenbaum said he could obtain a kidney for $150,000.
What you do is, you're giving a compensation for the time."
At their last meeting, on July 13, Rosenbaum said he had been arranging kidney sales for 10 years, the complaint says.
The price had gone up to $160,000, he said, because "it's hard to get people," noting that Israel had passed laws prohibiting the sale of human organs, the complaint states.
The remaining $80,000 would be due "when I get the donor in the hospital, check them out," the complaint says.
