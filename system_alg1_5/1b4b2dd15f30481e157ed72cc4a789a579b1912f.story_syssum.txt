Pieter van Vollenhoven, head of the Dutch Safety Board, said the instrument was one of the plane's two altimeters, which measure altitude.
The plane was on automatic pilot when it crashed.
In the immediate aftermath of the crash investigators said the plane fell almost vertically to the ground indicating the aircraft did not have enough forward speed.
Four of the crew and three Boeing employees were among the nine people killed in the crash.
