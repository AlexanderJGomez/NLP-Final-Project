After prosecutors brought charges against Hernandez, the Patriots offered fans who had purchased Hernandez jerseys the chance to trade them in.
Jersey owners had to go to the ProShop in Foxborough, Massachusetts, during store hours to exchange.
It's a different story on eBay, where Hernandez merchandise is fetching big bucks.
Hernandez, 23, is being held without bail at the Dartmouth House of Corrections in a 7-by-10-foot jail cell.
