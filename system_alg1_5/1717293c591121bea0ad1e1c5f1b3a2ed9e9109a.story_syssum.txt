But, during a phase-in period that now has stretched over 18 months, very few travelers have been referred to secondary screening, the report from the Homeland Security department's inspector general's office found.
The federal Customs and Border Protection agency, though, contends that the program is working, adding that it believes it is better to encourage compliance gradually then to enforce it right away.
Compliance has been greatest along the northern border, where 98 percent of travelers had the appropriate documents, the inspector general's report says.
As an example, it said the workload among secondary inspectors at the El Paso, Texas, border crossing could increase 125 percent with "full compliance" of the law.
"Travelers are never admitted until identity, citizenship and admissibility are established to the satisfaction of the inspecting officer," the agency said.
