(CNN)When Longmont, Colorado, police officer Billy Sawyer responded to a 911 call from a pregnant woman who was stabbed and had her fetus ripped out, he wasn't prepared for what they would see.
"She's an amazing woman to have that will and that drive to survive and do what she did and be able to contact the police and tell us where she was at, where inside of that location she was at, and speak to me as I entered the residence, direct me to her location," Sawyer said.
"I mean, she is the only reason why she's alive right now."
Still, given what Wilkins had endured, it left him impressed.
The fetus died, but the mother survived and "is improving minute by minute, hour by hour," according to Chris Wilkins.
