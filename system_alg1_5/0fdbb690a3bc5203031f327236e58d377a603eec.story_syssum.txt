I can't afford for that to come out.
OP to RS: I know.
OP to RS: I do appreciate it.
And the same things will play on your mind.
I'm terribly disappointed in how the day ended and how you left me.
I do everything to make you happy and to not say anything to rock the boat with u.
SO upset.
When I feel you think u have me so why try anymore.
Do this don't do that.
I just want to love and be loved.
Maybe we can't do that for each other.
The fact that I'm tired and sick isn't an excuse.
I'm sorry I wanted to go but I was hungry and upset and although you knew it, it wasn't like you came to chat to me when I left the table.
RS to OP: I like to believe that I made you proud when I attend these kind of functions with you.
I didn't think you would criticize me for doing that especially not so loudly so that others could hear.
I'm a person too and I appreciate that you invited me out tonight and I realize that you get harassed but I am trying my best to make you happy and I feel as though you sometimes never are, no matter the effort I put in.
