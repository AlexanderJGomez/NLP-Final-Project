Mark Berndt, 62, who taught at Miramonte Elementary School for more than 30 years, was accused of putting pupils in bondage and then photographing them with semen-filled spoons held at their mouths and 3-inch cockroaches crawling across their faces.
Berndt's attorney, Manny Medrano, said his client could be released after serving 19Â½ years of the 25-year sentence.
Last year, in an interview with CNN, the mother of a female student said her daughter went to Berndt's classroom, where "he would give her some cookies.
"He deserves to be punished," one mother said in her statement to the court.
"We are relieved that the students and families will be able to put this part of the proceedings behind them," Deasy said in a statement.
