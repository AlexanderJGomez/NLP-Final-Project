As kick-off draws the cacophony of noise grows ever louder
"I've been to many, many sporting events across the world," says Sean Foley, vice president of sport and media at the Raptor Group -- which is headed up by Roma's American owner James Pallotta.
And, with his blessing, it's as if Foley has been given free reign to explore football's final frontier.
WIf you're a Juventus fan or an AC Milan fan, that's who you are, that's what you're born into."
The Raptor Group's involvements in sport, technology and social media, as Foley explains, means Roma is uniquely positioned to exploit new technologies.
"When people tell you there are 3.5 billion football fans in the world, as a way to engage people on our platforms, it's certainly something for us to look at," says Max Goldstein, sports partnerships manager for Google.
"If you look across all social media platforms, there's a huge amount of interest in football," says Goldstein.
It's a far cry from how football looked in the 1970s, the era that Paul Tomkins, growing up in England, was first entranced by a dominant Liverpool team.
"It's about being totally neurotic about your team's result and then being totally neurotic about what everybody else is doing," he said.
It's more about other people's misfortune."
That's part of the failing of the new social media thing, where not everybody knows what things stand for."
"It's a whole new style of fan that's coming through because of the technology, because of the access.
My sense is that it's all pretty dull."
