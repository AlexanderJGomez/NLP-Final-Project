The killing was "heinous, cruel and depraved."
Cruelty classically consists of a desire to cause pain and suffering in innocent victims, or, at the opposite extreme, it reflects a cold, callous indifference.
And then there's the selection of the site, the Boston Marathon, an "iconic" event.
From his blood-scrawled justification in the boat after the bombing to this day, the message has been: Screw you, society.
After all, he was only 19.
Thus, their argument goes, a 19-year-old simply can't be the worst of the worst.
We do not, nor should we, dismiss this bravery as the product of an impulsive not-yet-fully-formed personality.
Worse, the historical record and headlines in the next day's anti-death penalty news organizations will probably proclaim:  "Jury Chooses Life for the Marathon Bomber" -- even if overwhelmingly the people's representatives were to vote for death as the more appropriate punishment.
And yet, if we really commit ourselves to having the punishment fit the crime, if we rightly reserve the death penalty for the most heinous crimes and criminals, surely the Boston Marathon bomber stands among the worst of the worst.
