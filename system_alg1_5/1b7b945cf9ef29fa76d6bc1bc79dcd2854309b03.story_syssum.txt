"Suarez is a sneak and he gets away with it because FIFA want their stars to play in the World Cup," Chiellini told Sky Sports Italia.
"I have watched the incident several times on television," he told reporters.
"I didn't see that.
"There seems there is animosity against this football player," he added.
Suarez's rap sheet is lengthy.
Last week, after scoring both goals in his side's 2-1 victory over England, Suarez hit out at the British media after claiming he had been unfairly treated over his transgressions.
"Before the game people in England laughed about my attitude over the last few years," he told reporters following the game.
Meanwhile, Italy coach Prandelli says he will step down following another World Cup disappointment.
"When there is failure, the person in charge must take responsibility," added Prandelli, who only extended his contract last month.
