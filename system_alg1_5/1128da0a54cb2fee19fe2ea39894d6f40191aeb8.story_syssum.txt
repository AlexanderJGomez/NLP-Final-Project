Still, it's not the first time the 81-year-old chairman of News Corp. has been grilled in the United Kingdom.
"And none asked," responded Murdoch.
For 60 years, Murdoch has been both a powerful private citizen in the United Kingdom, United States and Australia, and a businessman wielding huge influence, Wolff said.
His attitudes on issues including the Europe Union, opposition to a single currency, taxation and immigration have percolated down to the UK population through his titles, as they shape the news agenda, Barnett said.
"Time after time, Murdoch insisted on denying that he ever used his newspapers either for commercial advantage or for political advantage, which is quite extraordinary -- and frankly as a claim is pretty ludicrous," said Barnett, who attended the hearing in London.
"I, in 10 years in his power there, never asked Tony Blair for any favors and never received any," Murdoch said.
"He has more power than any other private citizen in the United States," said Wolff.
When the tea party movement began to coalesce in opposition to President Barack Obama in 2009, Murdoch's Fox News in particular helped boost it to national prominence, she said.
Their only weakness, she said, is that Fox News viewers tend to be older -- a minus for advertisers.
As a result, little new came out of the Leveson Inquiry hearing, Neil said, only a kind of "false modesty" as Murdoch sought to downplay his influence.
The son in question, James Murdoch, a senior News Corp. executive who was chairman of News International at the time of the alleged phone hacking but has since resigned from that role, testified before the inquiry Tuesday.
As for his father, he will be back on the stand Thursday.
