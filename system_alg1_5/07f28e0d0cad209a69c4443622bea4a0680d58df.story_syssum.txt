Wayne LaPierre says the Mexican drug war isn't a reason to restrict gun ownership in the U.S.
Now we do.
But that's precisely how the 1994 gun ban came about.
None of that was true.
And they banned them.
It was useless all along.
Because it's not true.
That's how gun abolitionists claim Mexican gun laws are so strict that our "weak laws" (read: freedoms) are to blame for "fueling the violence" in Mexico.
Even Immigration and Customs Enforcement said, "We have the laws we need.
We should seal the border.
But leave American freedoms alone.
