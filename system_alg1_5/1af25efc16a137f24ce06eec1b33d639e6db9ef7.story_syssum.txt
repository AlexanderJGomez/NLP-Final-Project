CNN's Jessica Yellin appears live as a hologram before anchor Wolf Blitzer Tuesday night in New York.
In reality, Yellin -- a correspondent who had been covering Sen. Barack Obama's campaign -- was at the now president-elect's mega-rally along the lakefront in Chicago, Illinois, more than 700 miles away from CNN's Election Center in New York.
She even referenced the classic movie on her own, saying, "It's like I follow in the tradition of Princess Leia.
"About a dozen years, I've been trying to do it," David Bohrman, CNN's senior vice president and Washington bureau chief, said to Blitzer on "The Situation Room" on Wednesday.
Chuck Hurley, the Washington bureau's senior producer of video and the staffer tapped by Bohrman to manage the execution of the "hologram," called it simple chroma-key technology that's been taken "to the Nth degree."
"Weathermen have been standing in front of green screens for years now, but that's [with] one camera," Hurley said.
Instead, for the past three months, the company has been perfecting it for CNN's election coverage, Oz said.
"We could have had a much crisper, more realistic shot, almost to the extent where the viewer at home would have had no idea even that the person wasn't really there," Hurley said.
Hurley said considering it was CNN's first real "test launch" with the high-end gadgetry, they were "beyond thrilled."
It was a little ornament on the tree," Bohrman said.
"We do serious journalism, but we also have fun.
Now, in hindsight, Yellin only wishes she could have come up with a better "Star Wars" joke.
