(CNN) -- HTC's new flagship smartphone, the One, is an impressive bit of hardware and a big step forward for the company in three significant ways.
"We think about the One X and we think 'Wow, it was big, and it was one of the best phones we've ever done,'" Scott Croyle, HTC's vice president of design, said.
Sense 4, the previous generation of HTC's Android customization, has been thrown out.
So, for the One, we really had to get it right, we really had to just go for it."
As with nearly every flagship phone out there nowadays, pixels are indiscernible on the One's generous display.
Inside, the One features a 1.7GHz, quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU, 2GB of RAM, and NFC chip, Bluetooth 4.0 and connectivity to both HSPA and LTE networks.
Sense 4, HTC's last skin, was among the best versions of Google's mobile OS thanks to its simplicity and gimmick-free implementation.
And the app can be connected to Twitter, Facebook, Flickr and other social networks as well.
"If you want regular Android, it's there," Croyle said.
"But, everybody's snacking on information, whether it's from their social networks or some news source that they're just interested in.
All too often, a great phone, like last year's One X, was confined to a limited audience due to carriers wanting exclusive rights to phones.
