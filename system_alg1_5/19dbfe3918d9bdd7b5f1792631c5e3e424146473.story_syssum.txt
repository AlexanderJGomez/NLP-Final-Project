The three adult suspects -- Venjah K. Hunte, 20, Jason Scott Mitchell, 19, and Charles Kendrick Lee Wardlow, 18 -- appeared in court Tuesday via videoconference wearing thick green vests, which defense attorneys said were suicide safety smocks.
The four men were arrested Friday, officials said.
Taylor, 24, died a day after he was shot during an apparent burglary at his home.
Taylor got up and locked the bedroom door, but the door was kicked in and two shots were fired, police said.
Several drawers and a bedroom safe were searched during the break-in, according to the report.
