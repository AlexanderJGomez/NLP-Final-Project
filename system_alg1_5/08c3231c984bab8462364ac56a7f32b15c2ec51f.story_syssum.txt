"I am so thankful to Shawn Holley and Evan Haney, her manager, for doing this," Michael Lohan said.
Lohan, 26, "wants to settle in" for a few days while arrangements can be made to transfer her to the Lukens Institute in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, which bills itself as a "luxury rehab center," Michael Lohan said.
None of Morningside's several locations in California are licensed, Tidwell said.
"Lindsay had no idea that Morningside wasn't approved," Michael Lohan said.
The judge ordered the treatment after Lohan entered pleas of no contest on charges relating to a traffic accident and, with those convictions, she was found in violation of her shoplifting probation.
She's spent 250 days in five rehab facilities since January 2007, including one long court-ordered stint after a failed drug test.
