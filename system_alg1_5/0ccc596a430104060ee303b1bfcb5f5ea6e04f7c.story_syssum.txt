About one-third of Latino voters say they have given this election "a lot of thought," while half of U.S. registered voters say they have, Pew said.
The study finds that while two-thirds of Latino voters support the Democrats, 22 percent back the Republican candidate.
"Yet when asked about the effect of his administration's policies on Hispanics, Latino registered voters are divided," Pew said.
Fifty-nine percent of Latino registered voters said they are dissatisfied with the country's direction, while 73 percent of all U.S. registered voters say the same, Pew said.
According to a Pew Hispanic Center analysis of Census Bureau data, Latino voters constituted 7.4 percent of all voters nationwide in 2008, up from 6 percent in 2004.
