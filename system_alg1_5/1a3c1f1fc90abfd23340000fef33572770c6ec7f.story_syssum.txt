The U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona declined to file charges against the Maricopa County Sheriff's office after an investigation into claims of abuse of county credit cards, misuse of funds and other financial matters.
"I am very happy with that," Arpaio said at a news conference.
One of the allegations was that the sheriff's office misused county credit cards.
Investigators concluded that while the funds indeed where shifted from one law enforcement program to another, there was no "criminal intent."
"I know my people do the right thing, they have a tough job, and because I'm a high-profile guy, sometimes there's more interest given to what we do," he said.
