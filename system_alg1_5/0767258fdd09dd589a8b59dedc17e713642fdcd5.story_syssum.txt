(Real Simple) -- I live in Chicago, and one of my best friends, Phyllis, lives in San Francisco, so we aren't able to see each other as often as we would like.
"You're going to love this place," I kept saying, and Phyllis, in turn, kept saying, "Oh boy."
I said, and she readily agreed.
Suddenly I remembered that my neighbor Suzie had given me a recipe, saying, "I really liked this, and I think you will, too."
I mixed up some martinis, put a CD on the stereo, cranked up the volume, and tied on my apron.
"It's very embarrassing for me," she said, and I saw tears well in her eyes.
I stood still, waiting.
Instead, what she said, in a very small, tremulous voice, was "I don't think you liked what I gave you for your birthday."
It was a true work of art, a labor-intensive wonder, and I loved everything about it -- except the person I was in most of those letters.
I came over to embrace her, weeping myself.
"I wanted to show you how you had changed," she said.
It wasn't a fun read, exactly, but I was surprised by what I found.
We both kept saying, "Man, this is sensational," then smacking our lips and taking more.
For me, it will always suggest another kind of mix: a warm kitchen on a winter's day, an old friend's candor and absolute trust, and a new friend's generosity in giving me a recipe, which is always about more than it seems.
And sometimes, the best times, it's both.
