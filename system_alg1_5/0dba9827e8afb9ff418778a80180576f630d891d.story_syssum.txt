MyCar, the electric vehicle developed in Hong Kong, would be perfect for the city, but faces big obstacles.
Hong Kong still hasn't got its act together when it comes to electric vehicles (EVs), according to the chief executive of MyCar's manufacturer, EuAuto Technology, Chung Sin-ling.
Hong Kong is not without EVs though.
"There should be very high incentives for people [to drive EVs]," says chairman of local pollution lobby group, Clear the Air, Christian Masset.
And education needs to come from the government, he says.
"The government is not helping the car user," says Cheng.
"Taxis, minibuses, buses can be forced to go electric but the government isn't doing anything," says Cheng.
And then there is the question of money.
We need to train the new engineers, the graduates, technicians," he says.
The market isn't though.
And that, she says, is something that is in the government's hands.
