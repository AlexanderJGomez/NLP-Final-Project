Surprisingly, he is now tripling down on his Syrian bet.
If he wins over the public, he will likely win Congress, too, but if he fails, he will have turned a problem in Syria into a crisis in his presidency.
Second, the bully pulpit may not be as powerful as often imagined.
The president has been arguing his case for nearly three weeks, and so far, he doesn't have many converts on the Hill.
Even overseas, among nations much closer to Syria, the president's rhetorical offensive has fallen short.
Early on at the White House, he could command massive, almost adoring audiences at every major address.
Witness his inability, even now, to build a public majority in favor of Obamacare.
This is clearly not the case with Syria.
He was not asking them to rally round a new, uncertain venture, and he was also still in his first term when audiences were big.
Obama does have unusually persuasive powers.
Perhaps ... perhaps, but if he has new arrows in his quiver, he likely would have shot them by now.
