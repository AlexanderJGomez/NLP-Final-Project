The 40-year-old actor is starring in the musical "Hedwig and the Angry Inch" as the titular German transgender performer, and he's so immersed in his character when on stage that not even an excited fan can pull him out of it.

"Hedwig and the Angry Inch," which has been running preview performances, will celebrate its opening night on Tuesday.
