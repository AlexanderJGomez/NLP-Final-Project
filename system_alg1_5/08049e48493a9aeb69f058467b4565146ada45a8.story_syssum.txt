Michael Kepler Meo is just 12 years old.
A boy soprano.
The Portland Opera company was holding auditions for "The Turn of the Screw" and Michael's choirmaster suggested he give it a try.
He also starred in the premier performance of "The Golden Ticket," an operatic version of "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."
"He was always making goofy noises all the time, from the time he was a toddler," says Michael's mother, Trudy Meo.
"I don't have too much contact with kids my age," Michael says.
By almost any measure, Michael's rise in the world of opera has been meteoric.
It will be a challenge, but, "It may be better," Michael says.
