Critics have questioned the validity of continued congressional scrutiny, especially Democrats, who say Republicans are only interested in discrediting the administration and hurting Clinton's chances if she were to run for president in 2016.
Hicks has been "praised by everybody who counts, the president, the secretary, everyone above him," Jordan said.
"She was with them, and most importantly (Secretary Clinton) was with them."
