Tuesday, in a bizarre development, George Zimmerman's attorneys, Hal Uhrig and Craig Sonner, during a news conference held in front of the Seminole County Courthouse, announced that they had withdrawn from his representation.
In short, they said that their client had gone rogue.
Not surprisingly, within hours of the now-infamous withdrawal, Corey issued a statement saying she would be holding her own news conference within 72 hours "to release new information regarding the Trayvon Martin shooting death investigation."
During her 25 years as an assistant state attorney, Corey tried hundreds of cases, including more than 50 homicides.
Corey, a devout Episcopalian, references her faith in discussing her cases, which some would say is a no-no for a prosecutor.
Pray for Trayvon.
If she files charges against Zimmerman, it would be wise not to "overcharge" the case.
But there is an exception.
And he is right.
Martin was 17 years old, Zimmerman, 28.
Zimmerman sees Martin, deems him "suspicious" and calls the police.
Martin asks Zimmerman why he is following him.
Martin is found dead, laying on his stomach.
Let them decide.
