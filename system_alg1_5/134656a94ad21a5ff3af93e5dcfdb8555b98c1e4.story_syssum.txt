The drills, the South Korean defense ministry said Thursday, will go on.
If they go ahead, the meetings of divided Korean families would be the first to take place since 2010.
The drills infuriate North Korea, which says it sees them as a prelude to an invasion.
Tens of thousands of people in South Korea are on the list of those wanting to take part in the reunions.
