"It doesn't matter where you go, there is a health club and it all started with Jack LaLanne," Schwarzenegger, the bodybuilder, actor and former California governor, said.
"I really never cared much for him when I was a kid, because he was everything I wasn't," Simmons said.
"Jack is now in heaven and, of course, that's going to be very annoying for a lot of people up there," Schwarzenegger said.
"The people are in a state of shock because they were promised if they were good, they could rest in peace," he said.
They warned "you could get heart problems, become a narcissist, turn gay, or it could reduce your sex drive," Schwarzenegger said.
"I got so pumped up, I couldn't move anymore," he said.
LaLanne was laid to rest with a weight he was holding in his left hand when he died, said his son, Dan LaLanne.
