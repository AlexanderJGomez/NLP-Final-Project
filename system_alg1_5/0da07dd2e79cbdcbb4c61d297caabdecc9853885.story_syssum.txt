The San Francisco-based 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, in a divided opinion, said the government cannot use urine samples and other evidence in its perjury case against the former San Francisco Giants star.
"There was a link missing here, that the only way to get down to the nitty-gritty that this was from Barry Bonds was using hearsay testimony," Talbot said.
Because Bonds also did not control the samples, the court reasoned, Anderson would need to testify in person on the material and the chain of possession.
The government had the burden of showing the samples came from Bonds, then went to Anderson and then to BALCO.
"Here, the testing was performed on Anderson's own initiative and not at the request of Bonds.
The lab performed repeated tests on athletes, said the government, to check whether the drugs were detectable.
Neither the government nor Bonds had an immediate reaction to the ruling.
