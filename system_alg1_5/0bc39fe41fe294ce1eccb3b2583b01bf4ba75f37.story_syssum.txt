The explosion has shut off the flow of gas to Israel and Jordan, said Ayman Jahin, a general manager at the gas company.
The first two attacks resulted in a halt in the flow of gas to Israel, which receives about 40% of its natural gas from Egypt.
In February, a gas pipeline in El Arish that sent natural gas to Jordan was set on fire, shutting off the flow of gas to not only Israel but but Syria, Jordan and Lebanon as well.
