Sixty-two percent of Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire say that if the primary were held today, Hillary Clinton, the prohibitive favorite for the Democrats' 2016 presidential nomination, would be their top choice, according to a Bloomberg Politics/Saint Anselm College poll released Monday.
Likewise, in 2008, after finishing a disappointing third in the Iowa caucuses, Hillary Clinton used her New Hampshire primary win to right her campaign.
Monday's poll, however, is not all good news for Clinton.
When matched up against Jeb Bush, the former Republican governor, or Rand Paul, the senator from Kentucky, Clinton enjoyed a 8 and 7 point lead, respectively.
Paul's strength in the state comes as no surprise, as its libertarian-leaning population drove his father, former Rep. Ron Paul, to a second-place finish in the 2012 GOP presidential primary there.
The Bloomberg poll suggests, however, Christie remains competitive in his home region, and that the two will have a fierce fight for the all-important early primary state if they both decide to run, as expected.
