"Our Palestinian brothers should declare an independent state," Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced to an assembly of Arab foreign ministers in Cairo.
During a speech that sought to highlight shared history, values and faith, he frequently referred to Arabs as "brothers."
"They [Israel] should pay the price for these attacks and crimes they committed," Erdogan said, reminding the audience of the botched May 2010 Israeli commando raid against a Turkish-led humanitarian convoy sailing to break Israel's blockade of Gaza.
He was clutching a poster with Erdogan's face on it, and said he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood.
"Erdogan he did not mention Syria," said Syrian film director Maan Alhasba.
Egypt is the first stop on what some are calling the Turkish prime minister's "Revolution Tour."
