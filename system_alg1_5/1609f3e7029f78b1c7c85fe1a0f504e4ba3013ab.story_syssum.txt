She thanks Hekmati in the acknowledgments.
"I really like him," said Condon, who identified Hekmati from the images released by Iranian state television.
His family, along with the United States, has denied the accusations against him.
"Under any standard, this is not acceptable due process of law," the statement said.
"We will not stop hoping and praying for justice, for peaceful dialogue with Iran, and for Amir's safe return home."
The United States and Iran have no direct diplomatic relations, but Hekmati's family has said he made the trip after obtaining permission from the Iranian Interests Section of the Pakistani Embassy in Washington.
Hekmati's family said that after his August 29 arrest, Iranian officials told them to remain silent "with the promise of an eventual release," but they went public after Iranian television aired the accusations and Hekmati's statement.
"They're always worried," she said.
