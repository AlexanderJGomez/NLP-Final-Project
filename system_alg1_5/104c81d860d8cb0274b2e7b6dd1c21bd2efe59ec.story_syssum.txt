Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- High tide on Friday sent some water pouring into the Bangkok's Chinatown area, but it receded within a few hours, while the commercial district remained largely dry.
"There is water from underground coming up," said Pracha Promnok, chief of the Flood Relief Operations Center.
"We are confident that we will not be affected," Toopetch said.
"You'll see dogs stranded on rooftops, dogs trying to swim," said Marcelo Cacciola, of the Soi Dog Foundation.
"Some families in southern Bangkok had their house flooded," said the 31-year-old worker at a furniture export company, which was shut after it, too, was flooded.
The floods, caused by monsoon rains that saturated rivers, have killed 373 people nationwide and affected more than 9.5 million people, authorities said.
Overall damage from the floods could exceed $6 billion, the Thai Finance Ministry said.
