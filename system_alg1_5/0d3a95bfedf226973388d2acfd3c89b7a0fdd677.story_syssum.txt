McDonald's claimed that the prefix "Mc" in McCurry trampled on its trademark.
"We're very relieved -- much, much relieved -- that this eight-year-old saga is finally over," said McCurry owner P. Suppiah.
The hamburger chain, which has 185 restaurants throughout Malaysia, said McCurry was violating the prefix "Mc" and that McDonald's had the right to protect it.
A lower court ruled in favor of McDonald's, and Suppiah appealed.
"We respect the finding of the court and beyond that have no further comment," said Liam Jeory of McDonald's Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region.
