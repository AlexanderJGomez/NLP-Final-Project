NEW YORK (CNN) -- Early last month, beautiful 25-year-old Laura Garza went missing.
Security video shows Garza leaving the club with convicted sex offender Michael Mele, according to the New York Police Department.
Mele is in jail for violating probation and is a suspect, but he has not been charged in Garza's disappearance, according to state police.
After all, most of them look pretty normal.
Laura Garza may have been unaware who she was with that night, but the legal system certainly knew him.
In a sane world, Mele is not a free man on that night, able to allegedly target Laura Garza.
The formula is simple.
But it's too late.
In the same Justice Department study, on average, the sex offenders served less than half of their sentences.
I see it.
My viewers see it.
