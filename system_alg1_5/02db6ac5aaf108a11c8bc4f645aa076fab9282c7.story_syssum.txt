This week, Suu Kyi made a triumphant and stirring return to the world stage, traveling to the West, her home for 24 years before she became an accidental leader of the revolution and the regime's prisoner in her home in Yangon, the generals' new name for Rangoon.
"The Lady," as she is known among her countrymen and women, stands as one of the few genuine heroes of our time, someone in the mold of Nelson Mandela and Mohandas Gandhi, who not only inspired by their ideals and sacrifice but, just as importantly, who prevailed in achieving their goals against powerful foes.
During the first quarter-century after the military took power, Suu Kyi lived abroad, as a mother, wife and academic.
Suddenly, she was in the middle of a revolution.
The West looked to her for guidance.
In 1999, when her husband was dying of cancer in Britain, the junta refused to let him come to Burma to say goodbye, offering instead to let her leave.
The technique worked because her charisma, spirituality and moral courage inspired not only her people, but the rest of the world.
There's more to it, of course.
She had become their only source of solace, their only reason for hope.
Ever the realist, Suu Kyi has warned against overconfidence, calling for "healthy skepticism" about reforms.
But if she and her supporters do, in fact, forge democracy in their country, as now seems probable, it is because she was able to leverage her appeal to bring harsh international sanctions against Burma.
