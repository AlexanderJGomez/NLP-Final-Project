After two years on the run, Harris-Moore, 19, heard the charge and possible jail time he faces for stealing a plane.
Before he gained notoriety as the brazen "barefoot bandit," Harris-Moore was a wayward boy who despite frequent run-ins with the law, behavior modifying medication, pleas from relatives and psychological counseling could not stay out of trouble.
"He was let down," Harris-Moore's aunt Sandra Puttmann told CNN.
But in a handwritten letter in Harris-Moore's court file, Kohler wrote, "This boy has had many disappointments all his life.
"He does things," Kohler's letter continues.
A subsequent live-in boyfriend, is described by Kohler in court records, as, "not playing with a full deck."
"His mom was drunk and screaming at him,' Island County court records said.
Six months later, Harris-Moore was arrested with three other boys for breaking into the middle school he attended.
In a 2004 report, Harris-Moore's probation officer wrote, "Colton and his mother share a tumultuous relationship.
Kohler stated, according to court records.
"Colton is incredibly bright," Miyoshi told CNN.
With Harris-Moore facing 23 charges, Miyoshi negotiated a deal where Harris-Moore plead guilty to three charges of burglary and was sentenced to three years in a juvenile detention home "I love that boy like one of my own kids," Harris-Moore's aunt Sandra Puttmann wrote, the judge in the case.
His reply was always the same, "He wasn't ready to stop yet," she said.
