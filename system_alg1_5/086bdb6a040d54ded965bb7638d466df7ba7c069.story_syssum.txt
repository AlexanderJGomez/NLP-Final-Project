On Thursday, French president Francois Hollande told a delegation of professional French football club leaders he wouldn't abandon the government's plan for a 75% tax on salaries reaching more than a $1.35 million.
If it goes ahead it would France's first football "strike" since 1972.
Just for Ibrahimovic's hefty pay packet alone, PSG's costs would increase by nearly $12 million under the Hollande plan.
"The high-income tax of 75%, which was included in the 2013 draft budget of France, will have a disastrous effect on the competitiveness of French football," said the Professional Union of Football Clubs (UCPF) in a statement.
"Monaco and PSG have raised the popularity and exposure of French football outside France," added Karlsen.
"In addition, each euro generated by clubs creates additional 2.5 euros ($3.38) in the country's economy."
"I remain confident that some sort of solution will be found before the date of the strike voted for by the club's chairmen," Julien Laurens, a French football expert and writer for Le Parisien, told CNN.
