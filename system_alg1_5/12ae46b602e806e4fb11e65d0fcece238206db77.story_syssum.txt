Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier, Haiti's former dictator, returned unexpectedly Sunday to the country after some 25 years in exile, adding uncertainty into an already turbulent situation.
Duvalier, wearing a dark suit and tie, greeted supporters at the busy Port-au-Prince airport.
When he died in 1971, he was succeeded by his 19-year-old son, Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier.
"There's definite energy in the air right now," he said, as he stood with a small crowd of Duvalier supporters outside of the hotel.
While groups of people have gathered in various parts of the city, they are calm and no violence has been reported, he said.
A runoff, originally scheduled for Sunday, was postponed.
"There are so many parties here and so many mixed feelings that it's really hard to know who to turn to at the moment," she said.
