After the president's speech, Elizabeth Alexander will read a poem she is writing for the occasion.
Alexander has written five books of poetry, including "American Sublime," a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2005.
Alexander: I think that the fact that President-elect Obama has decided to have a poem in this ceremony is a wonderful affirmation to the power of language, the way in which poetry gives us distilled and mindful and careful language that can both give us a moment of pause, a moment of contemplation and that can also ... look at the world from a slightly different angle.
Alexander: In the community in Hyde Park, he and Mrs. Obama were just people I'd heard about for a long time and heard wonderful things about, and we were of a generation.
Alexander: By writing and teaching.
Alexander: It's amazing, isn't it?
Alexander: Oh my goodness, so much.
Alexander: I do believe that it can.
Alexander: That would be fun.
Alexander: I show it to my husband [artist Ficre Ghebreyesus] , and he is my first, last and best critic.
That's my group, that's who I am, [I'm] proud and unambiguous about that -- but at the same time, one of the really great discoveries of a life in poetry has been that poetry is quirky.
Alexander: They are so excited, and that's of course a lovely thing.
Boy, that's going to be my gift for the year.
