He is charged with three counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Sheri Coleman, 31, and sons Garett, 11, and Gavin, 9.
Coleman was arrested Tuesday at his parents' home in Chester, Illinois.
Coleman said he was calling the house to make sure the boys were waking up for school, Connor said.
The message in the Coleman home was written in paint of a similar color, the article said.
Neither Coleman nor his attorneys have commented on that report, the Post-Dispatch said.
