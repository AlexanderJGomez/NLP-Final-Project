"I'm so scared," he said.
"I want Americans to know what's happening to me," Savoie continued in Japanese.
They have charged Savoie, 38, a Tennessee native and naturalized Japanese citizen, with kidnapping his two children -- 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca -- as his estranged wife, Noriko, was walking them to school Monday in Yanagawa, a rural town in southern Japan.
Japanese police, alerted by his estranged wife, arrested him.
Japanese law, however, recognizes Noriko Savoie as the primary custodian, regardless of the U.S. court order.
And, police said, the children are Japanese and have Japanese passports.
"Japanese people think she's the victim here," Savoie said.
"They belong with their real mother," said one woman, herself a mother of two children.
In the interrogation room, Savoie appeared exhausted.
"I love you, Isaac, Rebecca," he said.
Then, as is Japanese custom, he bowed.
