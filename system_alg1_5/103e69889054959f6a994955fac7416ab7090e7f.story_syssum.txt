Just 12 months ago, Murray stood on Centre Court and cried.
"It feels slightly different to last year," Murray told fans on Centre Court.
He did feel.
No, this time the British public knew they had someone special.
Murray is all too aware of the history.
"He believed in me when a lot of people didn't," Murray told reporters.
After taking the first set 6-4, Murray was forced to show the kind of resilience which he has become so well known for.
With just one set separating him from sporting immortality, Murray began in fine style, breaking Djokovic to take a 2-0 lead.
Once again, Murray was forced to call upon his powers of recovery, using even muscle and straining every sinew in a bid to level the set.
Then, finally, when the fourth Championship point presented itself, he took it.
As Murray sank to the turf, a nation rose from its slumber to salute a new champion, a new hero, a sporting icon.
