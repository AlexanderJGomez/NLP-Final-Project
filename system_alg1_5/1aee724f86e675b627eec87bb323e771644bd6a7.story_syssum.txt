Marco Rubio, R-Florida, and Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey.
The good news is that there was bipartisan support; the last time it was put to a vote, in December 2010, a slew of Senate Democrats voted for it, but so did three Senate Republicans -- Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Richard Lugar of Indiana and Bob Bennett of Utah.
Enter Rubio.
Under the proposal, there is no yellow brick road to citizenship, but nor is there a roadblock.
There's a catch.
The bad news is that Democrats are afraid of Rubio, and many of them have no interest in supporting any bill that makes the rising star look good.
That's a good thing.
What Rubio has in mind might not be perfect, but it's the only entree on the menu.
Regardless of party, whether they realize it or not, they have a natural kinship.
