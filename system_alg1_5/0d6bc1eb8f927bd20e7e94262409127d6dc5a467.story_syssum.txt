"I sit back and reflect on the difference between flood and fire," Dawson said.
The fire.
Dawson, a psychotherapist, was at work on Monday when her daughter, who happened to be in town, alerted her to the fire.
Time was ticking.
She had to leave.
The story of the doll, which they named Katrina, was even featured in the Wall Street Journal.
After this week's fire, though, there was nothing left of her house.
She will rebuild.
