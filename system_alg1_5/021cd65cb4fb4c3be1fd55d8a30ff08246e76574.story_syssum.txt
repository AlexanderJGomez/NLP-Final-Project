Gary Lamont Sumner faces a murder charge for his alleged role in the deaths of Byrd and Melanie Billings on Thursday, Escambia County, Florida, Sheriff David Morgan said.
The crime was "a very well-planned and methodical operation," Morgan said.
Both of the Billingses were shot multiple times, Morgan said, but he would not release further details on their deaths.
He would not say what, if anything, was taken from the home.
Nine of the couple's children were home at the time of the incident, Morgan said, and police believe three of them saw the intruders.
Two of the people in the photo are Sumner and the younger Gonzalez, but authorities want to know who the other man is, Morgan said.
"It leads me to believe that this was a very well-planned and methodical operation," Morgan said.
"It will be a very long time, I believe, until we piece together the truth of why this family was selected," Morgan said.
"They haven't asked too many questions," she said, noting that several have disabilities.
