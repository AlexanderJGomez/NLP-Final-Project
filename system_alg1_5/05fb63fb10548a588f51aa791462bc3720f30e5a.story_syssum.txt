Now that they are home, or soon to be home, our country has a solemn obligation to help them transition back to civilian life.
Today, nearly one in five women who are veterans have delayed or gone without necessary health care in the past year.
Today, one-third of the Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers lack a staff gynecologist and 18% of VA clinics have yet to hire at least one doctor specializing in women's health.
What's more, two-thirds of women report that the career service help offered by federal agencies has been sub-par.
In our report, "Women Veterans: The Long Journey Home," DAV outlines 27 key policy and program recommendations that Congress, the administration, VA and the Departments of Defense, Labor, and Housing and Urban Development can take to strengthen the safety net for female veterans.
For starters, veterans' health centers must meet their obligation to provide specialists in women's health.
Finally, as the VA and Defense work to strengthen services to servicewomen, these agencies need to invest in improved child care options.
For example, many are unable to take part in specialized mental health services, such as post-traumatic stress disorder support groups, because child care is unavailable.
