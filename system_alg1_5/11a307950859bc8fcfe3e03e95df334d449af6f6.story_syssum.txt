"The state did, in fact, meet their standard," Siracusa said of prosecutors argument that Curtis Reeves shouldn't be allowed to post bond.
The widow of the man that Reeves killed, meanwhile, applauded Siracusa's decision.
"I'm just very happy and relieved," Nicole Oulson said.
The bail hearing, which began Wednesday and resumed Friday after a day off, served almost as a mini-trial in itself.
Soon after that, a "very agitated" Reeves left the theater, then returned a few minutes later.
Alan Hamilton, an off-duty Sumter County sheriff's corporal, said he heard Oulson say, "I am trying to text my f**king daughter, if you don't mind" -- using graphic language that Reeves' lawyer said suggested Oulson was angry and threatening.
"I see that he's very explosive, unnecessarily," Reeves told police.
I assume it was his fist," Reeves told police.
Asked, though, whether she saw Chad Oulson strike Curtis Reeves, she replied no -- though she said it's what her husband told her after the shooting.
Six seconds later, Reeves appears to lean forward, but only for a second.
It's the row behind where a mortally wounded Oulson -- after stumbling then collapsing on another moviegoer -- is taking his last breaths.
