Chicago's 13,000 alleys, which allow rear access to buildings, date back to the 1800s.
So, the extreme alley makeover started with the pavement.
That's a big deal, Attarian explained, because the city takes about a billion gallons of water out of Lake Michigan every year.
Additionally, green alleys feature pavement that's high in albedo, or the ability to reflect light.
Chicago has greened 40 of them, with 48 more scheduled to get the treatment this year.
