Both the mother and baby are in good condition, the hospital said.
The pediatrician was a big help, she said, as were the flight attendants.
"He's doing so well and he's so cute," said Allison Peery, whose family lives in Wisconsin.
"It was amazing," a flight attendant said in a video posted on the airline's website.
For any passenger traveling after her eighth month, "it's a good idea to check with your doctor to be sure travel is not restricted."
However, "air travel is not recommended at any time during pregnancy for women who have medical or obstetric conditions that may be exacerbated by flight or that could require emergency care."
