A male used Carlesha Freeland-Gaither's ATM card at 6:01 a.m. a bank in Aberdeen, Maryland, about a 75-mile drive southwest from the Philadelphia street where she was forced into a car on Sunday night, Philadelphia police Chief Inspector Dennis Wilson told reporters.
She has a family here.
The released footage doesn't include audio, but a witness reported that Freeland-Gaither yelled for help, police said.
Just before the vehicle pulled away, Freeland-Gaither broke out one of the passenger side windows, police said.
Investigators aren't sure whether she knew her abductor, though there's no indication on the Philadelphia surveillance video that she did, Wilson said.
Officials are offering rewards of $42,000 for information leading to the case's resolution, including $25,000 from the FBI, which is assisting in the investigation, Wilson said.
