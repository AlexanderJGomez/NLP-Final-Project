After the summit, the government said the Internet Watch Foundation -- a watchdog body set up in 1996 -- would have new powers to seek out child sex abuse images, block access to them and remove them.
Tuesday's agreement represents a "fundamental change" in the way child sexual abuse content will be tackled, the Department of Culture, Media and Sport said.
"This will mean more images of child sexual abuse will be tracked down and acted on," said Culture Secretary Maria Miller.
Prime Minister David Cameron, speaking to reporters at the Group of Eight summit in Northern Ireland, said he was "personally committed" to the battle.
Some of that money will go to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children as well as the Internet Watch Foundation, said Jacqueline Fuller, the director of Google Giving, in a blog post.
