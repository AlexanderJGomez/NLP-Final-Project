Police said that a man broke into the Mosman, Australia, home of the woman, later identified as Madeleine Pulver, on August 3 and attached what she then believed to be a bomb.
That probe led to the arrest of the suspect around 3:30 p.m. EST (5:30 a.m. Tuesday in Sydney) in Louisville, Kentucky, by FBI agents working "very, very closely" with their Australian counterparts, said Scipione.
There were "some links between the suspect and the family, however no direct links," said the assistant commissioner, though he declined to elaborate, citing the ongoing investigation.
"The motto for (the New South Wales police force) simply says, translated, 'Justice swiftly follows crime,' " said Scipione.
"You've seen that today."
