(CNN) -- The most difficult decision a member of Congress will ever have to make is to commit our nation's armed forces to military action against an enemy.
First, I have concerns that a strike in Syria will only further muddle the administration's disjointed foreign policy approach to the region.
Right now, no matter how abhorrent the atrocities committed, the conflict is confined within the borders of Syria.
I don't believe that our military, or the American people, are ready to sink the ship.
Thus far, the specifics of a strike in Syria have not met this standard.
Such a situation would likely warrant a U.S. military strike.
In the end, if we are going to engage our military, there must be a clear threat to our national security interests at home and a clear strategy of what we are going to achieve.
