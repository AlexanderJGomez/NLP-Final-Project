It's downright disgusting to listen to conservative and Republican lawmakers, presidential candidates, business owners and media commentators use such vitriol to describe the Occupy Wall Street protesters as hell-bent on destroying America.
Every American, no matter if you're young or old; rich or poor; red state or blue state; Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, Native American; has the freedom to assemble and freedom of speech, which is at the heart of these protests.
Instead, they organized and mobilized to affect the political discourse in the Republican Party and have definitely had their voices heard.
Bahrain?
Those brave men, women and children chose not to accept the status quo, and this nation and the world are much better off because they did.
As a supporter of Occupy Wall Street, I understand fully the sentiment that is being expressed.
No, Occupy Wall Street is about trying to bring some decency and honesty back to an industry that used to have some.
Will we continue to allow them to trample over us with their "too big to fail" attitude?
No, no, and hell no.
