Meanwhile, the Olympic flame was being kept in an undisclosed location in advance of Wednesday's planed 6-mile relay in San Francisco.
The IOC's executive board will discuss the torch relay "in general" Thursday or Friday, but there is no proposal on the agenda to end the global tour early, IOC spokeswoman Giselle Davies said.
The official Beijing Olympics Web site, controlled by the Chinese organizers, gives little indication of any torch relay disruption.
David Perry, spokesman for the San Francisco Olympic Torch Relay, said he did not want to release the name of the person.
On Monday, three protesters scaled San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge and raised a large banner.
The three climbers, along with four people on the ground, were charged with felony conspiracy and misdemeanor nuisance charges, said California Highway Patrol Officer Mary Ziegenbein.
But other demonstrators, bearing Chinese flags, turned out in support of the Chinese government, and many others were spectators there just to see the torch.
"I'm a firm believer that we had the right template in the first place, that the torch simply should go from Olympia, Greece, to the host country," Gosper said.
