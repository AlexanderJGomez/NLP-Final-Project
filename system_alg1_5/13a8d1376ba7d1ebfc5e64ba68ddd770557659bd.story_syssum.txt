"He takes this personally because he feels a great responsibility for the lives and livelihoods of the people of Plaquemines Parish," said Benny Puckett, a parish employee who works for Nungesser.
Nungesser, president of Louisiana's southernmost parish, where the Mississippi River meets the Gulf, spoke with President Obama on Friday about how to minimize the spill's impact on a community whose livelihood depends on fishing and offshore oil industries.
"I worry about him.
"I talk to his fianc√©e to find out about him, because I can't talk to him because he's so busy."
He grew up in Algiers, outside of New Orleans, working in his father's cannery before starting his own business ventures.
Our father would tell him to sit in the corner, and he could not stand still," she said.
If they wanted modifications or a Jacuzzi, he'd find a way to do it," he said.
"He treated them all like they were his kids, like puppy dogs," he said.
Nungesser lost most of his herd when Hurricane Katrina roared through Plaquemines in 2005, carrying some of the elk up to 30 miles from his property, Cross said.
"He was eager, at a moment's notice, to help out.
"I saw absolutely no one standing up for the people of this parish," he said.
I can get him out on the boat or hunting, and he'll take it easy for a bit, but within 10 minutes, it's back to the business of Plaquemines Parish," said Cross.
... At the end of this thing, I have to know I did everything possible to save the parish and the coast land," Nungesser said.
