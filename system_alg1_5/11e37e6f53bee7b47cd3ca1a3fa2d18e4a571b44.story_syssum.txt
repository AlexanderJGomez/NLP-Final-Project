"North Korea will not be accepted as a nuclear power," Kerry said after arriving in Seoul.
Still, the defense agency said it has "moderate confidence" that North Korea could fit a nuclear weapon on a ballistic missile and fire it.
"Instead, we urge North Korea to respond to our call for building trust on the Korean Peninsula through dialogue, and now it is time for North Korea to make that choice."
"The United States stands vigilantly by the Republic of Korea's side, and is prepared for and capable of defending and protecting itself and its allies," the statement read.
Pentagon spokesman George Little said that "it would be inaccurate to suggest that the North Korean regime has fully tested, developed or demonstrated the kinds of nuclear capabilities referenced" in the DIA study.
On Thursday, North Korea briefly raised a missile into an upright firing position, stoking concerns that a launch was imminent, a U.S. official told CNN.
The first U.S. official cautioned that raising the untested Musudan missile, which South Korea says has a range of up to 2,175 miles (3,500 kilometers), could have been just a trial run or an effort to "mess" with the United States and its allies.
North Korea denied responsibility in a wave of cyberattacks on tens of thousands of computers at South Korean banks and broadcasters last month, the North's state news agency, KCNA, reported Friday.
"Japan would not be pushed around by rhetoric of North Korea," he said.
North Korea began to sharpen its threats in February, after the United Nations reacted to the country's third nuclear test with tougher sanctions.
"I think we have lowered our rhetoric significantly," Kerry said.
