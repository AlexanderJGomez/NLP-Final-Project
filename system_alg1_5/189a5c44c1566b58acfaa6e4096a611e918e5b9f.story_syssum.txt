Police carried out a controlled explosion at his farm in Aasta, about 100 kilometers (63 miles) north of Oslo, once some of the material was taken away as evidence, police spokeswoman Laila Sondrol told CNN.
The attorney, Geir Lippestad, said Breivik was surprised that his plan "succeeded -- succeeded in his mind."
While he said it was too early to say whether Breivik will plead insanity, Lippestad added, "This whole case indicates that he's insane."
During a closed court hearing Monday, the 32-year-old suspect said the attacks were necessary to prevent the "colonization" of Norway by Muslims, the presiding judge, Kim Heger, said.
Breivik is cooperating with police inquiries, "but he won't talk about the other cells," he said.
They declined to name the other countries, saying, "The investigation is in Norway."
"In my darkest moments, I think that rather than killing all those people, he should have taken his own life," Jens Breivik said in an interview with Norway's TV2.
"He must be.
I wish I could do something for them, but here I am, powerless to do anything," he said.
"No.
Eskil Peterson, a leader of the Labour Party's youth movement, the AUF, said the party had first been shocked and now was mourning those killed.
"When we see those names, it will be heartbreaking for everybody," he said.
Breivik is now "very tired" because of his circumstances, he said, but he was not injured when he was taken into police custody.
"Later, it became more extreme, and I remember after we all got on Facebook, I became friends with him there," Andersen said.
It's unacceptable."
Breivik asked to wear a uniform to the court hearing but was not allowed to, Heger said.
