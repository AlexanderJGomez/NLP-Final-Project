Since then, the United States has provided advisers to the Iraqi military in its fight with ISIS and has bombed ISIS positions.
That's a significant loss when you consider that ISIS currently has a core force of 9,000 to 18,000 fighters, according to U.S. intelligence estimates.
Balanced against this, however, is the fact ISIS continues to recruit at a fast clip.
ISIS has controlled Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, since June, but in the past month, Kurdish forces have closed in around it.
Further, a number of ISIS's leaders have been killed in U.S. airstrikes.
But overall, ISIS is maintaining its ground in Syria in spite of those airstrikes.
On January 27, gunmen claiming to be affiliated with ISIS attacked the Corinthia Hotel in Tripoli, Libya, which is favored by government officials and foreigners.
Similarly, in Afghanistan in the southern province of Helmand, a cell of more than 300 fighters loyal to ISIS is led by a former Taliban commander, Mullah Abdul Rauf Khadim.
The best way to begin to reverse this is to cripple ISIS in Iraq, where the group has shown itself to be the most adept terrorist group of the modern era, taking control of cities like Mosul, whose population numbers 1.5 million people.
Of course, there are risks associated with this.
