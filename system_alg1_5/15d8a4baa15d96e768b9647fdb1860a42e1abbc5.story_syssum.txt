(CNN) -- When the biggest United Nations (U.N.) climate change talks of the year, COP18, get underway in Doha, the capital of Qatar, this week, it will be the first time that the meeting has been hosted by a Middle Eastern country.
Of course, COP18 is not only about what the Arab world will do, but about what the rest of the world will do.
Agreeing to this peak will also mean that countries which have been big polluters historically, like the U.S., Canada, Europe, Japan and Australia, will have to increase their commitments on carbon emission reductions.
A peer reviewed report, called "Beyond dangerous climate change: emission scenarios for a new world," written by Kevin Anderson and Alice Bows in 2011, pointed out that there is a widespread understanding among scientists that an increase of four degrees Celsius in global temperatures is incompatible with an organized global community.
Compared to last year's negotiations, the political climate change leadership in China and the U.S. -- both major emitters with big pull at these talks -- is now certain.
Civil society is expecting these leaders to stand up where it matters -- inside the negotiating rooms of the U.N. climate talks and push toward a fair, ambitious and binding deal that will preserve the future of the planet for generations to come.
