Global climate change treaty, scheduled for completion in December, is designed to protect tropical forests.
Known as Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation in developing countries, or REDD, the provision is based on the knowledge that destroying tropical forests contributes to global warming.
Every year, tropical forests equal to an area the size of England are destroyed, contributing about 20 percent of total annual greenhouse gas emissions -- more than all the world's cars, trucks and airplanes combined.
"Done properly, this is our No.
The system would let nations and industries that are the biggest greenhouse-gas emitters buy carbon credits in tropical forests in South and Central America, Africa, Southeast Asia and other equatorial regions.
However, both funds are not fully capitalized, pending the successful conclusion of negotiations on the new global climate change treaty.
Now, they say, conserving forests also can contribute to sustainable development, benefiting both nature and people.
REDD also would protect standing forests, to prevent the absorbed carbon dioxide stocks from being released back into the atmosphere.
"If REDD mechanisms exclude any significant group of countries, REDD will fail," Jagdeo told U.N. negotiators in December.
Jagdeo, the president of Guyana, has said such critics should recognize the opportunity that a new climate change treaty could present.
"If there is a deal in Copenhagen and if there is a signaling by industrialized nations that, yes, they will make money available, then you will see developing countries scaling up their readiness," said the World Bank's Bosquet.
"They will see that this is now real and it's the time to react."
