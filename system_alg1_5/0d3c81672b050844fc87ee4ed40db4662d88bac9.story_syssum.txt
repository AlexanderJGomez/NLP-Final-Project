Weinstein was abducted early Saturday when gunmen, posing as neighbors offering food, pistol-whipped him and his driver and tied up his guards, U.S. Embassy and Pakistani officials said.
Austin Associates Inc., a U.S. consulting firm based in Arlington, Virginia, a Pakistani official said.
They pistol-whipped the driver and forced him to take them to Weinstein's room, where the men hit Weinstein in the head with a pistol, and forced him out of the house and into a waiting car, Hussain said.
Weinstein has lived in the residence in an upscale Lahore neighborhood for several years, Ahmed said.
Three weeks after their abduction, Pakistani authorities said they believed the couple was still alive.
Raymond Davis, a CIA contractor, was charged with killing two men in January but was released in March after compensation was paid to their families.
