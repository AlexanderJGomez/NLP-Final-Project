Yet Smith's rise has been greeted, in far too many quarters (including a number of comment boards on ew.com, like the one on my review), with bitter, gnashing resentment.
So where, exactly, should that piece of information lead us?
Oh, but, of course, the rap on Jaden Smith is that he's all nepotism and nothing else, that he's a kind of grouchy preteen Tori Spelling in cornrows.
Here's what I saw: Smith, seated opposite Letterman, conducted himself very differently from most child actors.
It's something that I've occasionally seen adults do, and yes, it was a little startling to see a kid this young with a movie to hawk go onto the Letterman show and assume that mock-confrontational, who's-really-in-charge-here?
Bottom line, for me: Smith was cocky as hell on Letterman, but he was also interesting.
Still, what's most striking, and perhaps revealing, about this particular outpouring of toxic anger is that Jaden's famous father, Will Smith, isn't just another big movie star he's one of the most likable movie stars you could ever imagine.
It's hard to shake the feeling, though, that too many people are trying to turn Jaden Smith from what he is, which is an insolently charismatic and hard-working young actor, into a focal point of ill will over issues of class, fame, money, and yes, I'm going to say it race.
What do you believe it's really about?
