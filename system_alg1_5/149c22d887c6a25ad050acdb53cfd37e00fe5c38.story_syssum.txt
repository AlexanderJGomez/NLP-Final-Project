A warrant issued for Lindsay Lohan apparently stems from her 2007 drunken driving convictions, police said.
It apparently stems from Lohan's 2007 convictions for drunken driving, police said Friday.
Lohan "has the right to appear" at the hearing, said Alan Parachini, Los Angeles Superior Court spokesman.
The first arrest, in May 2007, came after Lohan lost control of her Mercedes-Benz convertible and struck a curb in Beverly Hills.
Since then, she has starred in at least a dozen movies, including "Georgia Rule" with Jane Fonda in 2007.
