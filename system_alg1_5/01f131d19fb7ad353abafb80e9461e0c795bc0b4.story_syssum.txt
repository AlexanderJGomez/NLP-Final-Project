"Selma" did pick up two nominations, including one for best picture.
But it's hard to see that being the reason for its snub: "Gravity" was nominated for 10 Oscars, won seven, and yet you won't find an astronaut who would describe the film as accurate.
And "Dallas Buyer's Club" was also a 2014 Oscar darling that sprinkled creative liberties all over a true story.
Some, sure.
In a town full of gay men, the heart wrenching "Brokeback Mountain" somehow lost out to the woefully mediocre "Crash."
But I do not need her to win an Oscar to tell me how I should feel about "Selma."
To paraphrase the acceptance speech Common gave at the Golden Globes on Sunday, "Selma" the movie and Selma the historic marches are about the awakening of our humanity.
