At night it is very dangerous.
Sandimhia and 1.25 billion other women around the world, find themselves in similar situations every day, where they have no choice but to put themselves at risk of disease, harassment or even violence because they lack access to something as simple as a safe and clean toilet.
Today, 19 November, is the first U.N. recognized World Toilet Day.
Women are particularly vulnerable.
Progress has been made.
At the current rate of progress, this promise is way off track.
Even when this goal is finally reached, one in four people will still not have access to safe sanitation.
Getting everyone, everywhere access to a toilet would generate over $220 billion a year.
