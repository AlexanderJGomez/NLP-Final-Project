Now a younger generation, with strong familial ties there but far removed from the memories of Castro's revolution, want the embargo to end.
Sopo's father, who he says witnessed the killing, fought in the Bay of Pigs invasion.
"I think it has propped up the Castros because they can blame everything on the embargo," she said during a July interview on Fusion.
"The embargo has been in place for over 50 years, it has not worked.
It's not just Cuban-Americans, many young Latinos are questioning the embargo.
"For the first time in more than 50 years, shifting politics in the United States and changing policies in Cuba make it politically feasible to re-establish formal diplomatic relations and dismantle the senseless embargo", wrote the Times' editorial board.
And it can only be lifted by Congress and as Mauricio Claver-Carone, Director of the U.S.-Cuba Democracy PAC, a lobby group in favor of keeping the embargo, points out, all seven Cuban-American legislators, including senators Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Bob Menendez, are against doing so.
Furthermore, the 'historicos' who came to the U.S. in the late '50's and 60's are also experiencing attrition from aging."
But, only time will tell if a new generation of young, engaged Latino voters can exert enough political heat to completely thaw a relationship frozen during the Cold War.
