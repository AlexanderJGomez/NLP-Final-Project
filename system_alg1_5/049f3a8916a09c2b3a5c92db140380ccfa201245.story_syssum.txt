After all, the U.S. federal government lists dozens of capital offenses that are punishable by death, and not all of them involve a victim's life being taken.
They do, and they have.
As it relates to crimes against individuals, though, the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim's life was not taken."
If it's a crime against the state, well, it's game on.
If you commit an inherently dangerous felony, and a death results, you can be charged with "felony murder," which in some states qualifies you for the death penalty.
If you are in the armed forces, even more crimes can get you executed, such as desertion.
Of course, we have long recognized that military justice requires a degree of martial discipline that the civilian world simply doesn't.
If your crime is against the state, however, the Supreme Court will give the state some leeway in killing citizens.
