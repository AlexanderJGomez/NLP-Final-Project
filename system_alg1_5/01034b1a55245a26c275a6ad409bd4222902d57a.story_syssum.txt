This time, though, there was something new.
In the men's restroom, every time I've gone in, Elvis Presley's voice is singing.
.
The autograph was hers.
But now, in the dwindling weeks of 2011, in the BrickTop's men's room, here was Elvis singing, and here was Barbara Hearn's autograph.
"Well, I suppose it's all right if my name is on a restroom wall," she said.
(I got in touch with Ledbetter, who runs all six BrickTop's locations, most of which are in the South.
He loves Elvis.
"People sometimes say that Elvis and I went steady for a year," she told me.
Well, he didn't go steady with anyone."
"People don't understand what's in that picture," she told me.
I said yes, I thought it was.
("I didn't hold it against him at all," Barbara told me.
"That year of 1956, I saw him go from being barely famous to a super-duper star," she said.
"What a hoot," she said, and laughed again.
