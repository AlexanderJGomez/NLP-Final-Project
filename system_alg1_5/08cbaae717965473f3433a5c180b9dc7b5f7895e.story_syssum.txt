Over the past two years, the judges in the captain's trial have heard from a wide variety of people, including passengers, crew members and technical experts.
And since then, Schettino insisted, he's become a victim, processed by a "media meat grinder."
Schettino has also blamed the ship itself, saying the generators did not work so the elevators did not function, hindering some people's escape.
A native of Castellamare di Stabbia, near the southern city of Naples, Schettino comes from a seafaring family, Italy's Corriere della Sera newspaper reports.
Like all Costa masters, Schettino was "constantly trained, passing all tests."
Schettino is also accused of abandoning his passengers, who were unable to look after themselves, and to whom he had a responsibility as captain, when he left the ship before they did.
Schettino initially appears to play down the scale of the disaster, saying only that a "technical failure" has occurred.
As the night unfolds, the coast guard commander repeatedly questions why Schettino, as captain, is not on the ship when passengers are still aboard.
