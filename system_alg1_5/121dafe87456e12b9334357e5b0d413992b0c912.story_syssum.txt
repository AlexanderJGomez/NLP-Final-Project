"You elected me to strengthen the results that we had achieved in security, and we have delivered," Santos said in a televised speech Wednesday night.
One of Santos' rivals for the presidency is Oscar Ivan Zuluaga, who has called for an end to the peace talks and is against giving a political space to the rebels.
Santos placed all his political capital on the negotiations with the FARC, so it's natural that he is seeking re-election, another analyst, Vicente Torrijos, said.
"So he is going to present himself to Colombians and the world as the peacemaker and of course this is his best calling card to aspire to this re-election," he said.
