"I worked so hard to get where I was," he recalled of his promising career in the People's Liberation Army, which had sent him to a military academy for graduate studies.
"Then all of a sudden they just wanted me out because of my HIV status."
Their most recent outcry was triggered by a Commerce Ministry proposal that would bar people with HIV from entering bathhouses, including those offering spa and massage services.
"HIV transmission in a bathhouse or spa setting is not possible, and the use of such facilities by people living with HIV poses absolutely no risk from a public health perspective," the China office of UNAIDS said in a statement.
"Even people knowledgeable of HIV's transmission still feel scared because of many half-truths reported by the media," said the former sound mixer, 22, still fuming over the proposal's negative impact on his cause.
He lost the case.
"HIV/AIDS isn't terrible in itself," Xi said at the time.
"We have brought the topic of HIV/AIDS into schools but we only talk about the harm caused by the disease," said Meng Lin, who tested positive for the virus some 20 years ago and now runs the China Alliance for People Living with HIV/AIDS.
