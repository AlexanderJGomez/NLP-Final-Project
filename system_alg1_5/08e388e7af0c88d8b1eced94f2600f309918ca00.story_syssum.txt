A memoir detailing Shin Dong-hyuk's life, "Escape from Camp 14" hit the bookshelves in South Korea this month.
"The existence of prison camps in the North should be known to the people around the world," Shin said.
In March, the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva agreed to examine what it called "grave, widespread and systematic" violations of human rights in North Korea, including the use of prison camps.
"I'm grateful for people who are paying attention to the North Korean human rights situation," Shin said.
"And personally, I want to escape my past.
I physically escaped North Korea, but still my mind, my memories live there.
It was shocking to me," he said.
For example, the concept of "reward marriages" was unknown until Shin told his story.
Shin's testimony has encouraged the world to "grapple with the suffering," rather than just lampoon North Korea as a punchline, Harden said.
