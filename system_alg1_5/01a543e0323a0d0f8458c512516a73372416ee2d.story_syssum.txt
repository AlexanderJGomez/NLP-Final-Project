For many Egyptians the flat, round bread is also becoming a symbol of the country's inequalities.
The protesters, who are enraged by low wages and rising prices, also tore down a billboard of Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak.

At the same time the supplies of subsidized bread have also decreased.
In recent weeks, two people were stabbed and killed when fights broke out over government bread.
The army opened 10 large bakeries in Cairo and set up 500 kiosks to sell bread to the public, according to the government.
