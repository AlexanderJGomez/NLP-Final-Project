(CNN)It's one of the biggest sporting events on the planet and in a growing market for new fans, football's global governing body has cut a media rights deal  for the 2026 World Cup over a decade ahead of the tournament.
"You go into buying a World Cup and you believe it's going to be in the same time frame it's always been," Fox Sports President Eric Shanks said last year.
"FIFA aims to distribute the highest quality coverage of its international tournaments to as wide an audience as possible," said FIFA in a statement to CNN.
"These events are some of the world's most important sports competitions, and it is our privilege to be entrusted with these rights in the United States," Fox said in a statement.
