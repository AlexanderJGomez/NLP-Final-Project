I had been surprised to learn, in the spring of 1991, that as the seventh President of Ireland I would become the first to visit Britain as president.
This was neither a "state visit" or an "official visit"; it was a sui generis, carefully orchestrated meeting at head-of-state level between two countries with a troubled past seeking, in a symbolic way, to begin reconciling.
In June 1996 I was honored to be invited on an official visit to Britain by Prime Minister John Major, which included a lunch with Queen and Prince Edward, preceded by an inspection of the guard of honor at Buckingham Palace.
During and since my presidency of Ireland, a difficult peace process was undertaken and came to fruition.
Important amendments were made to the Irish constitution, which requires a referendum of the people, that both permitted the State to comply with the Belfast Agreement and provided for the removal of the "territorial claim" contained in Articles 2 and 3.
