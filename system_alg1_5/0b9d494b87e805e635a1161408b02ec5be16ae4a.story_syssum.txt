But many challenges remain.
"How this war winds down is very important to Afghanistan, to the United States and so many other countries," said CNN's Erin Burnett, who has been in Afghanistan this week talking to U.S. officials, troops and Afghan civilians.
CNN.com: You talked with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on Thursday.
He specifically mentioned to me Yemen, Somalia and Mali.
Burnett: In Kabul, traffic is a really huge problem, and they now have Afghan National Police doing the traffic control.
The deputy foreign minister I talked to said, "Look that's not really fair, we're trying to train brigades on one thing at a time."
And he really was loyal to them.
He really felt a sense of accomplishment and achievement, and you have to hope that his version of things ends up being the real version.
But yes, I have that fear."
Burnett: During the Taliban, basically there were thousands of girls going to school in Afghanistan.
There are women's rights activists who are really afraid that when the U.S. leaves, a lot of the progress will be rolled back.
They really want to stay in their country, and they say, in their own experience, that there's been such a change in what girls can do.
If you have that going for you, then I think that's probably the best sign of hope that there is.
