"Our family has been devastated by the loss of our beautiful daughter, Julissa," Carmen Guzman said in a statement released Friday, which would have been Julissa Brisman's 26th birthday.
Philip Markoff, 23, a second-year student at Boston University's School of Medicine, is charged with killing Brisman on April 14 at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel.
Markoff, who was arraigned Tuesday, is being held without bail.
She was held at gunpoint and bound, prosecutors said.
"Unfortunately, you were given wrong information as was the public," she wrote.
In executing a search warrant at Markoff's home, police found a firearm, along with restraints and duct tape, he said.
He said the incident "may be related to similar crimes occurring in the Boston area" but that had not been determined.
