Speaking this week at the Cheltenham Literature Festival in the UK,  to promote her new book "The Shock Doctrine," Klein attacked the "Bono-ization" of the protest movement, referring to U2 frontman Bono who is also an active anti-poverty campaigner.
Referring to the Make Poverty History Campaign at Gleneagles in 2005 she said, "It was the stadium rock model of protest -- there's celebrities and there's spectators waving their bracelets.
What's significant about the Seattle movement (the WTO protests in 1999 and 2000) is that it's less the tactics but the fact that it identifies that there are real power differences, winners and losers in this economic model."
It's taken that sense of urgency away."
Bono's Red initiative is emblematic of this new Pro-Logo age.
Klein says, "What they've tapped into is a market niche.
It changes nothing.
