Washington (CNN) -- The House Ways and Means Committee is the oldest, and arguably the most powerful, in Congress with members responsible for writing the nation's tax laws.
Asked if he should be helping to write laws he has trouble following, the Republican lawmaker said, "Well, I mean these are real property tax bills, which is different than what the Ways and Means does with income tax bills.
But they do.
At that time, while he strongly disagreed with decision to levy taxes retroactively, Jim Renacci paid the assessment in full, including interest and penalties," the statement said.
"We have a tax lawyer.
"Nobody wants to feel like a chump when they're paying their taxes and if they see that their lawmakers, the ones who actually write the tax laws, aren't paying their bills, it's going to make them wonder why they're paying theirs," Ellis said.
"Since then, I have taken corrective action to ensure this doesn't occur again."
Finally, there's New York Democrat Charles Rangel.
Yet years later, both Rangel and Buchanan still sit on the committee.
