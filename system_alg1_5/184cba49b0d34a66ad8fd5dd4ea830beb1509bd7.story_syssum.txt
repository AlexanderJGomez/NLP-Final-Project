"It's very, very important to keep that place open, giving good services" to the people of Juarez, De La Vega says.
"We were going under a bridge and there was a body upside down without a head, hanging there with all the blood flowing," she recalls.
This is a miracle of God, believe me," she says.
We have been working there for 37 years with the community," she says.
More than anything I wanted to protect my three children," she says.
"We want the baby to have a good beginning in life.
From there, you can do everything else," she says.
"We want the poorest people to have the best care because they need it and they deserve it."
For De La Vega, who frequently visits patients and is active in administrative, operational and financial aspects at the hospital, her work not only saves lives but has given meaning to her own life as well.
Because it's my life, it's my passion.
