Queen Elizabeth II's much beloved Royal Yacht Britannia carried members of the monarchy on almost 1000 official voyages over 44 years, from her launch in 1953 to her decommissioning in 1997.
"Any royal yacht is around for some time," says Ken Freviokh.
"A new royal yacht shouldn't be conventional," he says.
"It has to be a little bit of a transformer," he continues.
"People should melt when they see it," the designer says.
"It's a great way to get people together to sell a message -- no one could turn down an invitation to the royal yacht."
"In the current market, it's so much cheaper to buy an existing yacht and re-fit and condition it," says Huish.
"The outside should be modern but I don't think the royal family would go for a highly modern interior, it would have to be traditional," says the designer who thinks furnishing should be classic with a slight modern twist such as simple mouldings made out of wood.
