The plea deal may include prison time, but the NFL has not yet decided what football sanctions, if any, it should impose on Vick, a spokesman said.
Stephanie King of Arlington, Washington Michael Vick is a disgrace.
Patricia Reese of Paola, Kansas Yes, I think Mr. Vick should be allowed to play football again.
He should be made to work so many hours per week, every week, at minimum wage at an Animal Shelter.
What he did was reprehensible.
Angela Ziegler of Cleveland, Ohio The NFL needs to "step up to the plate" and be the man that Michael Vick is not.
I, for one, will boycott those with future dealings with him.
Bill Saray of Derby, Connecticut Vick should never play again.
As such, the league should ban him permanently, while society should shun him publicly.
Not by his fame, nor his race.
Lance G. of Dearborn Heights, Michigan First off, I am an African-American ... this is NOT a race issue.
Leah Perry of Chelmsford, Massachusetts I don't think Vick should be allowed to play football, nor should he get off easy.
I do not think he should be banned for life.
I don't think he deserves to play ever again.
Julio Hernandez of Kalamazoo, Michigan He needs to be banned from the NFL forever.
He's through.
John Brandon of Old Hickory, Tennessee To make a long story short -- my family will never watch a game with Michael Vick in attendance.
