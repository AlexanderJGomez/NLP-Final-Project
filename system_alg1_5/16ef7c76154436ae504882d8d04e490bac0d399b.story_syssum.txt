He neglects, of course, to recount the harsh realities of the Obama economy.
Take, for instance, the fact that unemployment has remained above 8% since the beginning of Obama's term.
The point is, these facts are overwhelming.
In a word, travesty.
In 2008, Obama regaled us with promises of hope and change, but his time in office has exposed the emptiness of these promises.
But of all of Schlossberg's claims, perhaps the most misguided is the notion that Obama has displayed political courage in the White House.
But in this case, it's about coming to terms with the fact that Obama has had his chance to lead and his policies have failed.
We can reward truth-telling.
