Ashley and Tyson Gardner tried unsuccessfully for years to get pregnant.
Ashley Gardner: We tried EVERYTHING under the sun.
It was getting hard getting asked ALL THE TIME why I didn't have children yet.
Even people I didn't know.
Gardner: "OH MY GOSH!!!!!!!"
But overall, we were just excited!!!!
They love him.
Gardner: YES!!!!
The chances of even getting one to stick was 40%.
Gardner: Only thing I can think of is what I stated above.
