(CNN) -- Politics might well be a dirty game, but in Malaysia where allegations of vote-buying, sex scandals and violence are a feature of the political landscape, a group of disaffected activists have distilled these predictable shabby tricks into a popular card game.
Play with up to six friends, of any race.
In an ironic twist, the game has even become popular with some politicians in Malaysia's ruling UMNO coalition, according to the group that developed the card game.
If you have Malaysian friends you can see it on Facebook and online - I think there's a creative expression tsunami going on," he said.
"We don't have a reliable mainstream media in Malaysia," said Chi Too, a communications officer with MCCHR.
On Sunday, voters will be asked to choose between the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which -- with its predecessor -- has ruled the country for more than five decades, and Pakatan Rakyat (PR), a loose coalition of opposition parties formed after the last election in 2008.
In a hard-fought campaign, both parties have been trying to entice voters with promises of generous government spending.
