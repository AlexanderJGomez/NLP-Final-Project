No, not Apple versus Samsung.
From the start, it was far from clear which console would reign over the world of gaming.
"These are two systems that are well-balanced to keep the furious battle between Xbox and PlayStation going for the next decade ... which can only be good for gamers everywhere," says David Hutchinson, chief video games writer for The Times of London.
Both systems are essentially PCs in a console shell," explains Hutchinson.
In turn, resistance from fans forced Microsoft to reverse its decision, explains Hutchinson.
"Rumors of gaming console death are a bit premature," says Eric Smith, a consumer electronics expert from Strategy Analytics.
Tablets and phones are cheaper [and] more easily accessible," says Smith.
But at the same time, if these functions do catch up, [Microsoft] stands to gain sales down the road."
"The joint dominance of the Xbox 360 and the PS3 marked a great era for the gaming public," he says.
