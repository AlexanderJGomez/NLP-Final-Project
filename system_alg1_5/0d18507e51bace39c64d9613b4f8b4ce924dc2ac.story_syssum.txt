The "partial skeletal remains" were found on the south bank of the Des Plaines River near Channahon, Illinois, according to Will County Coroner Patrick O'Neil's office.
On Sunday, Michelle Williams found a blue barrel in Channahon, Illinois, along the river and called police.
Channahon is 20 miles from Bolingbrook, Illinois, where Stacy Peterson lived with her husband, former police officer Drew Peterson.
Stacy Peterson, 23 when she was last seen, was Drew Peterson's fourth wife.
On the day she went missing, she petitioned a court to have her husband, Craig, evicted from their Plainfield home.
