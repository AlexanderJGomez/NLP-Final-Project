Thirteen years and more than 2,000 American casualties after it began, the war in Afghanistan will conclude responsibly, President Barack Obama said on Sunday.
"Our courageous military and diplomatic personnel in Afghanistan — along with our NATO allies and coalition partners — have helped the Afghan people reclaim their communities, take the lead for their own security, hold historic elections and complete the first democratic transfer of power in their country's history," Obama said.
Hagel said Sunday the work of U.S. troops has "made our world safer and given Afghanistan the opportunity to chart a secure, democratic, and prosperous future."
Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican, visited Kabul on Christmas to meet with Afghanistan's new president.
