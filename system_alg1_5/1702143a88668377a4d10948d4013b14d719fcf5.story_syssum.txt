Shayanna Jenkins has not been charged in connection with the investigation, and lawyers representing her fianc√©, Hernandez, have not responded to requests for comment.
The day after Lloyd's body was found, Shaneah Jenkins told authorities she was with her sister, Shayanna, and two uncles at Hernandez's home.
A search of a rented storage unit in Bristol, Connecticut, allegedly paid for by Hernandez, did not locate the weapon used to kill Lloyd, according to law enforcement officials.
