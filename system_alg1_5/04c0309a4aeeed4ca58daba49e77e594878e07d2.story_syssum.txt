Four people were reported killed in Metro Manila, two in Central Luzon, and one in Catanduanes, the Office of Civil Defense said.
In Albay, in southern Luzon, more than 3,000 people were affected, the state-run news agency said early Wednesday.
On Tuesday, weather officials said the storm was packing top winds of 140 kph (87 mph).
DJ Santa Ana, head of news operations at TV5 in Manila, told CNN it was likely to take some time to restore the power supply in major parts of Metro Manila.
Dacalanio said the winds had uprooted street lights and brought down trees and road signs, but that luckily there was no flooding near his home.
