Nance, a third-year student at the Art Institute of Dallas, was found stabbed to death Saturday in her apartment.
"She was a very talented animation student," Stockton said.
"They have security there," Stockton said.
"She had multiple stab wounds," Reyes said.
"We have a couple of people we are pretty interested in," he said.
"She was a great student, always came to class, always involved on campus," Stockton said.
