Like seasonal flu, H1N1 is more active in the winter than in the summer, and a majority of infected people get better on their own, Fukuda said.
Mexico, for example, has seen more cases from September to November than they saw in the preceding months from April, when the virus emerged, he said.
In Central America and the Southern Hemisphere, however, activity levels have dropped as those regions enter the summer season, Fukuda said.
In Australia, for example, "aboriginal groups are disproportionately represented in people who end up in hospitals from diseases related to the pandemic," Fukuda said.
"At WHO, we remain quite concerned about the patterns we are seeing, particularly because a sizable number of people develop complications [that lead to death]," he said.
"Antivirals are quite useful against these infections," he said.
Other useful protections against H1N1 are vaccines, which the WHO recommends against pandemic infections, Fukuda said.
