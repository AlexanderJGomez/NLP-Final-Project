"Moving on from the Army has been a really tough decision," he said in a statement released Tuesday.
"Captain Harry Wales," as he is known, from his official title and name of His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales, began his formal military duties in 2005 at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.
"We have prepared a challenging program that will see Captain Wales deploy on urban and field training exercises, domestic deployments, as well as participate in Indigenous engagement activities," said Air Chief Marshal Mark Binski of the Australian Defence Force.
"Wounded warriors" are a special interest for Prince Harry.
"This is a big, bold step for Prince Harry," said CNN Royal Correspondent Max Foster.
He's passionate about the military, though, and I don't think will ever lose that connection."
