"There was a group of soldiers in the 5th Brigade numbering in the single digits who did not behave with honor," Col.

At 415,000 acres, it is the largest on the U.S. West Coast, according to its website, with tens of thousands of military and civilian personnel and their families.
In addition, the joint base houses "more than 30 different units from the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, Reserve and National Guard and Department of Defense agencies," the site says.
The soldier accused in Sunday's deaths remained in U.S. custody on Monday as investigators try to determine his motive, including examining his mental stability and medical history.
