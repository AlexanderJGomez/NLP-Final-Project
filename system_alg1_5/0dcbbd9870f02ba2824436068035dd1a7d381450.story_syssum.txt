A few years ago Patrick worked with Activision to promote its racing game, "Blur."
Patrick, who was recently named Nationwide's most popular driver by NASCAR fans, took some time to play the new Sega game and talk about her own gaming background in this exclusive interview for CNN.
I played a lot of games growing up, as any kid naturally would do.
It's really neat to be a player in it, especially being such a famous game, such an iconic game.
So to be in something like a Sega game is to me more cool because it's something that's not common, and it's not given that I would be in those games.
Video games are pretty popular, for sure.
If you think it helps you then it does, but I don't know.
I do think that they can.
Well, that's the phone.
Well, they're very visual.
I think it also is about being able to have fun, and the games just get better and better over time.
That's just the day and age we're living in.
I don't know.
Honestly, I only need two.
I don't need any more.
It's not always going to happen.
That's the wonderful world of fantasy.
