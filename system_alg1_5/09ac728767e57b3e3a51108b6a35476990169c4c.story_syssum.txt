All were brought to you by introverts.
And these introverts did what they did not in spite of their temperaments -- but because of them.
When I was a kid, we sat in rows of desks, and we did most of our work autonomously.
The same thing happens at work.
There's also a term, ambivert, for people who fall smack in the middle of the spectrum.
In fact, we often seek out this balance instinctively.
And for some people it's the air they breathe.
No wilderness, no revelations.
So it's much better to send people off to generate ideas by themselves, freed from the distortion of group dynamics, and only then come together as a team.
But I am saying that we all need alone time.
