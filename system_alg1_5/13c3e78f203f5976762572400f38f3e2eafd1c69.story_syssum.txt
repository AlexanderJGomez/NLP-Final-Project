In the words of President John F. Kennedy, she looked "smashing" in the suit, which may be why the President asked Jackie to wear the now-famous outfit to Dallas on November 22, 1963.
Museums have hosted collections of her gowns, hats and jewelry.
Hours later, Jackie Kennedy was trying to crawl out of the presidential limo, her suit spattered with her husband's blood.
Hours later, Kennedy continued to wear the suit during the emergency swearing in of Johnson as President.
In 2003, nine years after her mother's death, Caroline Kennedy gave the suit as a gift to the people of the United States with the understanding that it would not be put on display until 2103.
And even then, the Kennedy family will have to be consulted before any attempt is made to display it.
It has not been seen since."
