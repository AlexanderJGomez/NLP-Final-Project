With climate change, he says, this history could be repeated.
"When I was young this lake was full, says Lazarao Maraka, a local fisherman.
Sometimes it is hard to see the effects of climate change, but not at Lake Turkana.
"I think the prospect of many of these half million people living around the lake today of having to relocate to cities and to slums and to abandon their culture, abandon their ancestral land, become paupers in their own land, I think it is very real," Leakey says.
Climate change does affect the Turkana people, says Ikal Angelei from the Turkana Basin Institute.
"With the increase of drought it has made the communities unable to adapt to the changes, because it happens so often," Angelei said.
This lake is the Turkana's life," Maraka says.
Today, it could also be providing a window on its future.
