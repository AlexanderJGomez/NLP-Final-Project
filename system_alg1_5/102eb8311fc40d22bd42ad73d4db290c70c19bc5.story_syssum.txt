The preservative, thimerosal, has not been used in childhood vaccines since 2001, except for some flu shots.
The study authors say this is evidence that thimerosal does not cause autism, although advocacy groups say it's too soon to determine whether autism rates have been affected.
They reasoned that if mercury exposure in vaccines was a major cause of autism, the number of affected kids should have dropped after thimerosal was removed.
From 2004 to 2007, when exposure to thimerosal dropped significantly for 3- to 5-year-olds, the autism rate continued to go up, from 3 per 1,000 children to 4 per 1,000 children in California.
As many as one in every 166 children in this country is found to have autism, and doctors still don't know why.
What we eat, what we breathe, what we drink -- all these things could play a role.
Some of them used thimerosal as a preservative.
In 1997, Congress passed a bill that mandated review of products containing mercury, which led manufacturers to begin removing thimerosal from vaccines two years later.
