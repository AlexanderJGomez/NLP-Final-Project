(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tried to defuse tensions between China and Japan, a strategic U.S. partner, on Saturday, asking the two rival nations to return to negotiations over a group of Pacific islands under dispute.
China and Japan have historically laid claim to the islands, which lie between the two nations.
On Friday, Japan said it will release the captain, but did not offer a time frame.
While China has sought to negotiate territorial rights to the South China Sea individually with countries in the region, the ASEAN nations have called for a collaborative resolution.
In addition to rich areas for fishing, the islands in the South China Sea are believed to have large oil and gas reserves and surround busy sea lanes shuttling resources for China's fast-growing economy.
