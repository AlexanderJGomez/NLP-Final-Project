Haskell, 34, is being held on charges of capital murder, Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Ron Hickman said.
Haskell, apparently posing as a parcel delivery driver late Wednesday afternoon, entered the home of one of his estranged wife's relatives while only the children were there, Hickman said.
Haskell was not the slain children's father, as police had mistakenly asserted earlier, Hickman said.
Police trapped Haskell in a cul-de-sac, and he surrendered after about three hours, having had discussions with negotiators, Hickman and Gilliland said.
Haskell has children with his estranged wife, but those children were not believed to have been in the Spring-area home where the shootings happened, Hickman said.
