A few years ago, people started using synthetic marijuana to evade drug tests -- and it caught on, once news reports publicized its existence.
Almost no one would touch this synthetic stuff -- actually, it wouldn't even exist -- if it weren't for the criminalization of the marijuana plant itself.
Like aspirin or soft drinks, they are not subject to age, licensing, or other restrictions.
Oddly enough, the rush to criminalize synthetic marijuana and other synthetic drugs comes at a time when public opinion is dramatically shifting in favor of decriminalizing, and even legally regulating, marijuana.
On the other hand, synthetic marijuana -- whether underregulated or outright prohibited -- hasn't ever been subject to an appropriate level of regulation.
Under prohibition, regulators have no control over where the product is sold, who sells it, or to whom they sell it.
Indeed, drugs, whether marijuana or synthetic marijuana, should not be legally regulated because they are safe -- they should be legally regulated precisely because they can be harmful.
