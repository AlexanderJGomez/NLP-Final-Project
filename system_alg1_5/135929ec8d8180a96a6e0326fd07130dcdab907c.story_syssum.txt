Summer is prime time for wildlife viewing, the season when you'll catch birds and animals tending their young and storing up energy before their fall migrations to winter feeding and breeding grounds.
The coastal plain along the Beaufort Sea, the heart of the refuge, offers spectacular wildlife viewing.
From late spring through the summer, orca sightings are very common here: three extended family pods regularly pass through, following salmon migrations.
Even if you don't spot an orca during your trip, you're likely to see a variety of marine life, including sea lions, harbor seals, porpoise and perhaps even gray whales.
With more than 1 million acres of glaciers, forests, lakes, mountains and wetlands, visitors to Glacier National Park have the chance to see everything from elusive wolves, grizzlies and mountain lions to the more common mountain goats, bighorn sheep, elk and moose.
As with other large animals in the park, they'll sometimes cross the road directly in front of cars, so drivers should take great care.
The best opportunities to see the bats are in July and August, before they head to Mexico for the winter.
From May through July, female turtles swim onto beaches to dig deep holes, deposit their eggs and cover them before returning to the water.
Don't dig in the sand, and avoid using flashlights, flash cameras or other electronic devices.
Keep your eyes peeled for deer, foxes, opossum, otters, whales and dolphins, too.
