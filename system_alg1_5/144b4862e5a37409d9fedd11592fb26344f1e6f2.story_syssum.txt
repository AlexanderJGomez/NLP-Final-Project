Chris Christie, two prominent Republican governors with well-known national ambitions, were engaged in a different kind of campaign.
Ultimately, both Jindal and Christie would each have a shot at running the RGA, Jindal in 2013 and Christie in 2014.
And with good reason.
When Perry stepped aside, Virginia Gov.
Jindal, a veteran member of the RGA's executive committee, was hoping to follow him in 2014.
"The leadership teams for 2013-2014 were decided last year," said Phil Cox, the RGA's executive director.
One GOP operative familiar with the jockeying, however, said Jindal and his team were "a little frustrated" by Christie's attempt to pry away a job that the Louisiana governor thought was rightfully his.
It's not how the organization was structured, really.
It soon became clear, though, that "Christie had the votes," one person familiar with the whip effort told CNN, citing Christie's argument that it would be best for him to run the committee after securing re-election in New Jersey.
Christie would take over the following year, with Jindal as vice-chair.
"It was a win-win, though it was probably a little more of a win for Christie."
I think he is going to a great job campaigning across the country for our incumbents and our challengers as well."
