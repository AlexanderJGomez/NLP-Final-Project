Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Another Taliban leader has been seized in neighboring Pakistan by security forces, sources said.
They're not backing down," CNN's Atia Abawi reported from the battlefield, where she is embedded with U.S. Marines.
"About five minutes ago, Taliban started attacking our area," she said shortly before 8 a.m.
The Nad-e Ali district is "broadly secure," Carter said, noting there is still Taliban resistance in Marjah.
Across the border in Pakistan, four people were killed and five were wounded Thursday when a drone fired on a suspected militant compound in the country's tribal region, intelligence sources and a local political official said.
The four dead were suspected militants, two intelligence officials said.
Salam is believed to be the Taliban commander for Kunduz, Omar said.
Yaqubi said Salam and another Taliban "shadow governor," Mullah Salih, were arrested last week in the Pakistani city of Peshawar.
Taliban sources and Omar said other suspected members of the Afghan Taliban were arrested with Salam, but their identities are not clear.
