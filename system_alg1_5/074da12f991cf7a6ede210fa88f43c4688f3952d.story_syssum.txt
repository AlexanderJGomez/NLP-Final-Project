The Amazon rainforest covers a huge area, roughly half as large as the United States, with around 60% of it in Brazil.
Protesters say the new code, which could come into effect after a much-delayed crucial vote, reduces protection and weakens enforcement laws.
"The changes in the new Forest Code will reduce this protection.
At present, Brazilian government statistics show that about 30% of the country's land is given over to agriculture.
"The new proposal includes all the government's requirements.
Environmental groups are concerned, but the rural caucus, on the other hand, are worried too.
The pop singer, Sting, and his wife Trudie Styler, set up the Rainforest Foundation in 1989 after seeing the destruction of the Amazon rainforest and its impact on indigenous peoples.
It called for the establishment of an "independent institution for a national monitoring, reporting and verification system," a two-year moratorium on all new concessions for forest clearance and enforcement of laws on illegal logging.
"In short, in our opinion and analysis, the moratorium has not been working well in halting deforestation in Indonesia," said Yuyun Indradi, Greenpeace forest campaigner in Indonesia.
"We must attain both development and the management of our forest -- simultaneously," he said.
"This is because forest management is tightly intertwined with the livelihood of our people, with our food security, with the availability of wood and fuel.
"Reliable monitoring and information are essential for protecting forests," said the institute's Fred Stolle.
