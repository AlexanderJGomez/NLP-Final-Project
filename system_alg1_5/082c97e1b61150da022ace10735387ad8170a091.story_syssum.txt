With the defiant decree by the small canton, the Kurds are doubling down, staking out a position as the stalwarts of modernity, not intimidated by opponents whose brutality has caused other armies to flee.
The timing of the decree is not accidental, and it is certainly brazen.
The decree was issued by the Jazira district of Syria's Hasakeh province, about 100 miles from the now-legendary town of Kobani, where armed Kurdish men and women are holding their positions, battling to prevent the ultra-radical Islamic State, also known as ISIS, from overrunning their territory.
Until now, women were not allowed to inherit.
In addition, the rule establishes maternity leave for women and, importantly, it mandates that no woman be married without her own consent, and never under the age of 18.
Still, ISIS, too, claims it empowers women.
The women's battalions also help in body searches, preventing men dressed as women from moving through checkpoints.
There are reports of armed women stopping girls in the street, quizzing them on their knowledge of Islam and of ISIS rules.
In Kobani, about a third of the warriors are women.
For women defending their territory, it is a delightful irony.
