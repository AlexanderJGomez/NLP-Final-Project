Kimani Gray, 16, died over the weekend.
"He has a curfew," she said.
Kimani Gray then "turned on them," it said, and pointed a .38-caliber revolver at the officers.
The teen died at a hospital, and a loaded .38 was recovered from the scene, the statement said.
"He is not the public's angel, but he's my angel, and he's my baby, and he was slaughtered and I want to know why," she said.
On Tuesday, another protest brought out a mostly calm crowd that returned Wednesday, anticipating that Gray's mother would speak, said iReporter and professional photographer Joel Graham.
The police were caught off-guard," Graham said.
Forty-six arrests were made, including two juveniles, with the majority charged with disorderly conduct.
"As a black man growing up in Flatbush, you just expect to be harassed by the cops, pulled over, arrested and now just straight up killed," said Shanduke McPhatter, a 35-year-old former gang member who works with young men in the neighborhood.
The violence over Gray's death will eventually subside, but the intense distrust of police will rear itself again violently soon enough in Flatbush, said Lumumba Akinwole-Bandele, a senior organizer with the NAACP.
"There are no community centers here," McPhatter said.
We have to do our part, too.
