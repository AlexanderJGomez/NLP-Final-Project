The Jabra BT3030 is in the style of a pendant, or as its design suggests, more of a dog tag.
They are the Play/Pause key, the track shuffle keys, the volume controls, plus the multifunction Call key.
The 3.5mm headset jack is on the right spine, while the charger jack is on the bottom.
From there, we could play/pause tracks, skip songs, and adjust the volume, all from the Jabra BT3030.
After you hang up, the music will resume from the paused point.
The bass was a little weak, but the overall quality was decent.
The Jabra BT3030 also comes with an optional clothing clip accessory, plus an AC adapter.
