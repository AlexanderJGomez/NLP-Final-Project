Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski, a 1994 graduate of the Air Force Academy who served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, was arrested Sunday for allegedly grabbing a woman's buttocks and breasts in a parking lot in Arlington County near the Pentagon.
After taking the position with the sexual assault prevention unit in February, he underwent training aimed at preparing him for his duties, Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. John Dorrian said.
"The incident occurred in Arlington, not on a military base," Stamos told CNN.
President Barack Obama has said he will not tolerate such conduct and urged the Pentagon to step up its prevention efforts.
