(CNN) -- Philip Chism, 14, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to murder, aggravated rape and robbery charges in connection with the killing of his high school math teacher, Colleen Ritzer.
Denise Regan, Chism's public defender, has declined to comment.
The video shows Chism leaving the restroom, returning later with a recycling barrel, and again leaving the restroom pulling the barrel -- this time with a black mask on his forehead, the court papers say.
Police discovered Ritzer's body in a wooded area near the school, covered with leaves and debris in an apparent attempt to conceal it, the court papers said.
Clothing and other belongings were scattered near the body, along with the blood-soaked gloves Chism appeared to have been wearing in the video.
Chism's mother, Diana, told investigators that she had recently moved to Massachusetts from Tennessee amid a "stressful divorce" from the teen's father.
