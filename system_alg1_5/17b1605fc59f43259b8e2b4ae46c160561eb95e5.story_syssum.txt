The blaze, which grew to more than 20,100 acres, was 5 percent contained early Sunday, officials said.
"The fire has been very active on all fronts," U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Randi Jorgensen said.
"Basically, all the homes that back up to the National Forest in the La Canada-Flintridge are in danger from the fire," Jorgensen said, adding that fire officials have told residents to be prepared for possible evacuation orders.
The blaze, called the Cottonwood fire, started Thursday afternoon about 10 miles from the southern California city of Hemet, officials reported.
The blaze, called the Morris fire, started Tuesday.
That fire was about 85 percent contained Friday evening, officials said.
