(CNN) -- In recent months, Americans have experienced numerous extreme weather-related events, including droughts, wildfires and heat waves.
Understandably, many Americans are wondering if these events are manifestations of a longer-term shift in climate.
On the other hand, the study found no evidence that the devastating floods in Thailand last year were connected to climate change.
One upward trend is indisputable: At NOAA, requests for climate data have skyrocketed, and those data are increasingly helping stakeholders cope with extreme events.
Last year, for example, firefighters in Texas used long-term climate information to prepare for the spring/summer 2011 wildfire season.
These are the kinds of practical actions that inspire me in my job as we work to make the best science available to understand and reduce the impact of extreme events on families, communities and businesses.
