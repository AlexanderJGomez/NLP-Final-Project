A storm survey confirmed that an F-1 tornado touched down in Jeffersontown, Kentucky, east of Louisville, according to the National Weather Service.
A separate survey was still on-going in the Churchill Downs area, said the Weather Service.
However, the track's training facility, Trackside Louisville, was not damaged and will remain open, the statement read.
Rogers said the horses may need to be moved because of the possibility that the storm had left nails on the ground, which could injure the animals.
