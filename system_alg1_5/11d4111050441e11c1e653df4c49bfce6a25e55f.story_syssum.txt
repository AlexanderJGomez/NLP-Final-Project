AT&T made a similarly surprising move in March, declaring its intention to buy T-Mobile, in large part to get access to T-Mobile's underused spectrum.
Ah, you say, there's no real comparison.
To be sure, the problem here is not precisely a shortage of spectrum, but wasteful allocation of what's usable with the latest technology.
This is an old, but important, idea first suggested by Nobel economics laureate Ronald Coase back in 1959.
So AT&T and Verizon, the No.
Verizon's 4G system, the holy grail of mobile excellence, is expected to be available to some 200 million Americans by the end of this year, compared with roughly 70 million for AT&T.
But as the Verizon gambit makes clear, this is anything but a static contest.
As we see it, Washington has three options.
The third option, and probably the best under the circumstances, is to look on the Verizon and AT&T gambits with sympathy, on the premise that the vitality of innovation means more to consumers than the potential downside of greater market concentration.
