But that's the way my life has unfolded.
I learned very early that survival would mean figuring out how to work with, rather than against, nature.
In 2009, I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, and it turned out that the confidence I gained on "Survivor" proved even more valuable than the million dollars.
The drug born of this flower, vincristine, was part of the regimen that saved my life.
According to a recent study, natural drugs and related products are used to treat 87 percent of all known diseases, including cancer, heart disease, diabetes and HIV.
According to the World Conservation Union, more than 16,000 species, plant and animal alike, are in danger of extinction, largely because of human activities.
But in each case, I didn't do it alone.
The rosy periwinkle saved my life.
