â€¢ Washington, D.C.
KAREN CAIFA, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Right, Carl.
REBECCA SCRITCHFIELD, REGISTERED DIETITIAN: We need to be eating, and we need to be eating light meals, eating often, and we also want to make sure that we replace a lot of the water that we lose when we're sweating.
SCRITCHFIELD: They're so hot, so hard to digest, with all that extra fat in there.
CAIFA: And most people know to stay hydrated, but check the labels on flavored waters and other drinks.
You want to avoid that, especially in the heat, Carl.
AZUZ: All right, Karen Caifa.
Thanks so much for being with us on CNN Student News.
