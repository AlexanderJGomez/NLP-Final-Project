Davydenko, seeded sixth, had begun the week with a thrilling three-set loss to Djokovic in round-robin play, but proceeded to rack up four straight victories, culminating in his emphatic win over fifth-ranked Del Potro.
The second set was tighter, with Del Potro having a break point in the sixth game.
But at 4-4 Davydenko made his move on Del Potro's service.
You are a great champion," he said.
