But the Chilean capital, Santiago, is looking to do just that by encouraging travelers passing through on business to stay and uncover its potential as a hip South American destination.
"There's a lot of interest in coming to Chile," he adds.
With the Santiago business traveler in mind, CNN asked Lonely Planet's Bridget Gleeson, co- author of Lonely Planet Chile and Easter Island Travel Guide, to lend her expertise in selecting the city's best spots.
Vistors can "tour (the Chilean poet and author) Pablo Neruda's charming hilltop house, La Sebastiana" or "board one of Valparaiso's 15 antique ascensores (elevator cable cars) ... to take in vibrant street art and stunning views over the ocean," says Gleeson.
The Paielan Observatory in the Maipo Valley is just 50 kilometers from Santiago and is surrounded by a spectacular, unspoilt nature reserve.
"Many travelers opt to visit a few wineries with a specialist like Uncorked Wine Tours," says Gleeson.
If you're planning an independent visit, Gleeson warns however, it is wise to log onto the wineries' websites to find out about specialty tastings, picnics, and additional activities before setting out.
