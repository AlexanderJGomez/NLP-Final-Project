Here, his wife, Julie Chaffetz,  talks about how she copes with the challenges of her freshman year as a "congressional spouse."
No one makes you read the bills, but to do the job right, you must.
Through trial and error, Julie and I have learned some important strategies for making our family time count.
Julie's challenges are different from mine.
Time seems to be flying, as the saying goes, and it is fun.
Before Congress, I tended to deal with things day-by-day.
Now, time is precious.
Fortunately, Utah is a great midpoint.
And we still manage to read good books, too.
Above all, I have learned to be flexible and keep my sense of humor.
Good friends are priceless.
