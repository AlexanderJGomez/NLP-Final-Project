Some Potter fans, under the leadership of Slack, have come together to bring the spirit of "Dumbledore's army" to life.
In the "Potter" books, "implications toward public policy are profound," Slack said.
"I saw that the books weren't just empowering personally," he said.
Earlier this year, the Harry Potter Alliance conducted a book drive for children around the world, an effort led by "Potter" actress Evanna Lynch.
On the other hand, Slack compares Potter's mentor Dumbledore to Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr. and John Lennon.
Rowling herself has praised the Harry Potter Alliance, one of Slack's proudest moments.
"It's incredible, it's humbling, and it's uplifting to see people going out there and doing that in the name of your character," she told Time magazine in 2007.
This year, 52 such "Can't Stop the Serenity" screenings are taking place around the world for charities such as the human rights organization Equality Now!, in response to a challenge by the film's director Joss Whedon.
"I know I would have loved to have had a group like this when I was a child or teenager, to support me and show that anything is possible if you put your mind to it," said 29-year-old Amanda Bolton, from Calgary, Alberta.
"I sort of took it as a compliment," he explained.
"There have been some interesting debates over whether or not Dumbledore would be an activist," he said, mentioning that some see Dumbledore as "teaching through living."
"It has introduced me to new issues and new ideas."
