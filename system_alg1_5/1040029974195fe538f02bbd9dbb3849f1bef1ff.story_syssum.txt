We love him, too.
Well, he gets a tie.
Yeah, it will be a tie.
Or, if he's lucky, his young ones may do a handmade gift.
He was a veteran.
And every once in a while, he gets to parent a "son."
But, it was probably true.
Those who were present with necessities, yet absent from their children's lives.
My dad, Lionel, let me know how proud he was, even as he kept me from being too big for my britches.
On this Father's Day, I think of my Dad, my grandfathers, uncles and my two brothers who are good dads to their kids.
I think of all the fathers who've lost daughters and sons to illnesses, or accidents -- far too often a father's only child.
Happy Father's Day to all the dads, granddads and soon-to-be-fathers.
