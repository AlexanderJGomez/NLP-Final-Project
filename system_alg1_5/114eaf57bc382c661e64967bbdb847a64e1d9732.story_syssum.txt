Since the start of the year, there have on average been two or more licensed protests a week, the authority said, many of which expressed views critical of the government.
"The reality is that one would be hard pressed to find a protest that both begins and ends peacefully," IAA spokesman Fahad Albinali said.
The rallies have been associated with "violence, rioting and attacks on public and private property," and are a threat to public safety and commerce, according to the news agency.
The independent commission, set up by the king, concluded that police had used excessive force and torture in their response to the protests in the Sunni-ruled, Shiite-majority country.
It recommended reforms to the country's law and better training of its security forces, as well as other measures.
