There's little doubt Syrians suffered a chemical attack last month.
"We are especially sensitive, Chuck and I, to never again asking any member of Congress to take a vote on faulty intelligence.
They haven't linked it directly to Assad, in my estimation," Rep. Buck McKeon, R-California, told CNN's State of the Union Sunday.
And intelligence does not work that way," he told CNN's State of the Union.
Physical, "concrete" evidence shows where the rockets came from, when they were fired, and that not one landed in regime-controlled territory, Kerry said.
"In the three days prior to the attack, we collected streams of human, signals and geospatial intelligence that reveal regime activities that we assess were associated with preparations for a chemical weapons attack," the U.S. report says.
"We have a body of information, including past Syrian practice, that leads us to conclude that regime officials were witting of and directed the attack," the report says.
"We are certain that none of the opposition has the weapons or capacity to effect a strike of this scale, particularly from the heart of regime territory," Kerry told lawmakers.
But the findings were not conclusive, the U.N.
"Al Assad has no credible motivation to use these weapons at this stage, and in this phase of the conflict.
A preliminary assessment "determined that 1,429 people were killed in the chemical weapons attack, including at least 426 children," the U.S. report says.
And Obama says that cat's out of the bag.
"Frankly, nobody is really disputing that chemical weapons were used," he said.
"The evidence speaks for itself," he said.
