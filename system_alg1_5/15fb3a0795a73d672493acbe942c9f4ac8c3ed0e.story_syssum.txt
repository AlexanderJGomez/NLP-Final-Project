Carey, 34, died after police shot her following a wild chase.
The foreign currency, both paper and coins, was inside a plastic Ziploc bag.
The boyfriend said she claimed President Barack Obama had placed Stamford, Connecticut, where she lived, under lockdown and that her house was under electronic surveillance, said a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation.
The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was not authorized to release details to the media.
...We are going to conduct our investigation, and we are not going to go with just what the government said."
