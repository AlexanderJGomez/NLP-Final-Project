Stephen Colbert's trip to Iraq, facilitated by the USO, was six months in the planning.
The organization, which was founded in 1941 to bring comfort and entertainment to America's men and women in uniform, has been focusing its support on American troops stationed around the world, particularly those in the military theaters of Iraq and Afghanistan, said Phillips.
Colbert's excursion, which the comedian called "Operation Iraqi Stephen," was unusual for the USO, she added.
"We're primarily a volunteer organization," he said, noting the USO has fewer than 400 paid employees and 25,000 volunteers.
We want you to send us some material, some jokes," he said.
Toby Keith has gone on at least seven USO tours; "He insists on going to the smallest, most remote places," said Phillips.
"We have celebrities come to Bethesda Naval Hospital, Walter Reed ... and they almost always insist we don't talk about [the visits]," said Tischler.
"Service members in Iraq and Afghanistan are frequently at small, remote bases," said Phillips.
