"I have considered all the offers I have received in the past few weeks, but feel that Shanghai Shenhua FC is the right move for me at this time," said Drogba in a statement released through his representatives.
"Drogba is a very good soccer player, his outstanding skills and amazing experience will give us motivation to improve our games," said Argentina's 1986 World Cup winner.
"We have been wanting to sign Didier for a while, and are very happy that it has finally happened," said Zhu.
Italy's World Cup-winning coach Marcello Lippi is now in charge at Guangzhou Evergrande, an ambitious club who in the last year have signed Argentine Dario Conca and Paraguay's Lucas Barrios.
