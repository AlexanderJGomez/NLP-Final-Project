"No, seriously.
On Tuesday, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a former prosecutor, disputed those characterizations.
The controversy focuses on statements that Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Weisbard wrote in a December 19 motion to dismiss the teacher's lawsuit against the state, the warden of the Arizona State Prison Complex -- Eyman, and other prison personnel.
The teacher has been distressed by the state's effort to dismiss her case, according to Zwillinger, her attorney.
"Absolutely, it's blaming the victim," he added.
I get it," he said.
The inmate, Jacob Harvey, now 21, is charged with rape, assault and other charges in a January 30, 2014, attack on the teacher at Eyman prison in Florence, and he has pleaded not guilty.
The prison gave the teacher a radio to use in case an inmate "acted up," the suit said.
The teacher "stopped fighting hoping to simply survive," and then the inmate raped her, the suit said.
The state also argued that the teacher "has attempted to recast absolutely routine prison events," court papers said.
