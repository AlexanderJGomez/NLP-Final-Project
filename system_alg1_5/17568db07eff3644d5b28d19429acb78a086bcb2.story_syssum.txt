Marisella Molinar was killed while driving her boss, a target of cartels, across the border into El Paso, Texas.
But on December 3, 2008, by around 5:30 p.m., Jose Molinar still hadn't heard from his wife.
"As soon as the image came up, I saw her truck," said Molinar, who was watching the news out of Juarez, "and I knew what happened right then and there."
One shot hit Marisella Molinar, a mother of two and proud grandmother, in the chest, killing her instantly.
This year, in two months, the body count in Juarez is 400.
The fallout has led rival drug gangs to launch all-out war not only with the military, but also with each other, because the once-established drug routes are now up for grabs.
"They started killing police officers, and not when they were doing police work, but when they were coming out of their homes and getting into their cars to go to the police station," said Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz, whose own family has recently received death threats.
"It's not going to be won quickly," said Enrique Torres, a spokesman for the Mexican government, adding that the Mexican president is committed to fighting the cartels.
We know the monster is big, but we don't have an idea of how big it is."
