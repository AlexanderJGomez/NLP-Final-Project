Anyone they found hiding in the garage, they shot them.
Police ordered him to lie down on the ground, the witness said.
One of them said, 'Today you go die,' and then he shot him in the side.
James Manook, a spokesman for Plateau State where the violence occurred, said the Human Rights Watch claims are "one of the issues that the commission has under inquiry, and given that - I do not want to comment while it's under investigation."
"At least 130 men were killed by members of the very institutions charged with protecting them," said Corinne Dufka, senior West Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Eric Guttschuss, a Human Rights Watch researcher, testified before the commission Monday.
