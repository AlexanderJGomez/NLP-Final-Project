We got to meet Alex's best friend, Ryan Cooper, who spoke about how people were "drawn to him."
I love him with all my heart."
He went on: "I would like to see CNN come out with a policy that said, 'Moving forward, we're not going to talk about the gunman.
Let's move on'... CNN, Fox News, the major networks.
Still, if mass shootings weren't big news, you would worry.
Like Teves, many people suspect that some sort of media glory is part of the payoff for these mass killers.
The problem, unfortunately, is that people still jump on ball fields.
And to the extent that it can address such big questions, news organizations should make the necessary inquiries -- dig into the suspect's past, find indicators of questionable behavior, look for signs of terrifying intent.
And, I would add, on the victims' friends and families, who tell us so movingly that they will remember.
As Teves said, "You know, Alex would have expected us to live.
Here, too, we have questions: Who is this killer?
All of this matters.
