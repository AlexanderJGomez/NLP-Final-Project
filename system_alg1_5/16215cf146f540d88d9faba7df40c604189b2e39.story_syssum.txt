That's when my dad dropped me off on the front porch of Sunnyside School in Brownsville, Texas, the border town where I was born and raised.
When I turned to face the classroom, the teacher's mouth moved and I heard words, but I failed to understand.
My teacher, Mrs. Collins, was a tall, grandmotherly figure with neatly coiffed silver hair and wire frame glasses.
And that was that.
There, in a predominantly Hispanic grade school run by Catholic nuns, I began to wrestle with what my name meant to me, and how I wanted it pronounced.
Balance.
Balance, or the constant search for it, became a hallmark of my life.
And all along, as I introduced myself, I started my name in English and switched gears into Spanish for the second half.
But, despite the difficulty, I persevered.
So I practiced some more.
Balance.
If the innkeeper had taken an empathetic, compassionate approach -- like Mrs. Collins did with me -- he might have elicited a more positive, collaborative reaction from his staff, media and observers.
Just like my name.
