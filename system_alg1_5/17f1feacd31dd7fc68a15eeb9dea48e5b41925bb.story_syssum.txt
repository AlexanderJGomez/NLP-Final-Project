Rebels had detained the peacekeepers, identified by the Philippine government as Filipino, in a Syrian village near the Golan Heights.
The peacekeepers reportedly are unharmed.
The consul general of Philippine embassy in Jordan confirmed the release, and said the peacekeepers were being transported to Amman.
Al-Khatib then said the peacekeepers were taken to protect their safety and that of a U.N. convoy in an area under bombardment for seven days.
