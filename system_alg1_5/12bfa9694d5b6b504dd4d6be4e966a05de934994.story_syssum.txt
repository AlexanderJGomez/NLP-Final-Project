Established in 2007 following the Red Mosque siege, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), or Pakistani Taliban, is now a prominent actor in that country's politics.
In Swat, the TTP targeted landowners and gave local peasants greater access to vacated land and gemstones mines, which, through profit-sharing agreements, also afforded the movement a new revenue stream.
Some have criticised Pakistan for not addressing the TTP and other militant groups sooner, or not taking the threat they pose seriously enough.
Nevertheless since 2009, there have been annual military offensives against the TTP and affiliates, leading to thousands of internally displaced people, collateral damage and a few militant deaths.
Schools, especially girls' schools, are a frequent target of the TTP.
The TTP target public spaces that distract from their vision of the perfect life: shrines, barber shops, Eid prayer congregations, market squares, music shops, political rallies, and schools.
Pakistan is a resilient country, surviving one crisis after another.
If people hide behind closed doors, remain uneducated, the TTP's ideal of a restricted politics and an empty public sphere will become reality.
