More than 400 tribal gunmen took over Taiz in southwest Yemen, witnesses there said.
Meanwhile, President Ali Abdullah Saleh was in Saudi Arabia Tuesday, recovering from burns over 40% of his body and a collapsed lung, a U.S. government official briefed on the matter said.
Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has a presence in the southern province of Abyan, a U.S. official said.
The man, described as an "infiltrator" who tried to cross the metal-and-sand barriers at the border, fired at the security officers when they approached him, the agency said.
Yemeni investigations are "focusing on what happened inside the mosque," not a rocket or mortar attack, diplomats said Monday.
The official, who asked not to be identified, said that Saleh was in the mosque when two "projectiles" were fired during Friday prayers.
A U.S. government official said Monday he could not imagine the Saudis letting Saleh return.
"We rely on the Yemeni government as partners," the official said.
