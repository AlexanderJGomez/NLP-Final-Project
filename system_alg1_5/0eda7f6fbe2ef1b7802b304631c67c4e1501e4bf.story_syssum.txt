Millvina Dean, 97, is trying to raise money so she can stay in the nursing home she prefers.
"Historical documents say she was lifted from the lifeboat onto Carpathia, the rescue ship, in a mail sack," Aldridge said.
If it was the bag she was rescued in, it would be £30,000 to £40,000, ($44,800 to $60,000), but we can't prove it.
"As she said, £3,000 a month is £36,000 a year, which is a lot of money," he said.
Dean's previous sale, in October, raised just over £30,000, Aldridge said.
"If she's lucky, she'll get another four or five years; she's quite a fit lady," he said.
Dainton-West, who was 10 months old when the ship went down, died in October 2007, the auctioneer said.
