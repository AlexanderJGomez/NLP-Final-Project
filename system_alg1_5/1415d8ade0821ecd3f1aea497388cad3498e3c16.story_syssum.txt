(CNN) -- A potent storm system socked the Mid-Atlantic and as far north as New York on Thursday, lashing the region with damaging hail, strong winds and pelting rains.
The National Weather Service documented scores of other such reports, including ones indicating hail the size of golf balls in locales from Hamden, New York, to Roxbury Mills, Maryland.
This activity includes a "possible brief tornado" that may have hit in Prince George County, according to the weather service.
Some places north of Rome, New York, already got as much as 6 inches of rain, for instance.
CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton, Aaron Cooper, Lorenzo Ferrigno, Kevin Conlon and Matthew Stucker contributed to this report.
