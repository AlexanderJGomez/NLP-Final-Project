Less often remembered, though, is an eerie interlude that can easily be taken as a mirror of our own times: Scrooge's appalled encounter with the two fearful children, a boy and a girl, "yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish," who emerge from the robes of the Ghost of Christmas Present.
As a boy, Dickens worked long hours for about a year in a small-scale factory and later drew on this experience, to him deeply degrading, in the early chapters of "David Copperfield."
He continued to fear the danger represented by the boy Ignorance, who re-appears in the last of his Christmas books, "The Haunted Man" (1848), as the savage street-child whom Redlaw, the protagonist, tries vainly to help.
Again, as someone who in his last novel, "Edwin Drood," depicted a drug addict who turns to murder, he would have been equally appalled by the drug culture now so widespread among the young.
In the new Disney film a ferociously scowling Ignorance wields a lethal-looking knife, and Want is a teenage prostitute driven crazy, presumably by drug abuse.
