(CNN) -- California's Supreme Court on Tuesday denied the San Diego County clerk's request to immediately halt same-sex marriages in the state, the latest, if not necessarily last, key ruling in a years-long legal fight.
"Your religion, I respect it, I don't agree with it," LGBT rights activist Sean Sala said.
"I asked for a stay because it's cruel to set up people," the county clerk said.
A federal appeals court subsequently ruled that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional, though it still issued a stay on same-sex marriages until the U.S. Supreme Court could weigh in.
Gay rights groups, like Marriage Equality USA, cheered Tuesday's decision denying Dronenburg's request.
"California Supreme Court still has to has to hear petitions to halt same-gender marriage in August."
