During the trial, Brancato said there was not a break-in.
Brancato said he knew the owner of the home, and that he and friend Steven Armento, 51, were drinking at a strip club when they decided to go hunt for valium.
"This jury spoke loud and clear, that Lillo had nothing to do with the murder of this police officer," Tacopina said.
As a teen, Brancato starred alongside actor Robert De Niro in "A Bronx Tale."
