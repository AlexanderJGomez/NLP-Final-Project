My sister and I hated it at the time.
On holidays, we would go to work with her.
We'd always sit in the kitchen.
I started baking.
God has always been with me.
It was something I was going to do out of high school, and I put it off.
I wasn't ready.
But this process of thinking about it, it's been all my life.
I will miss the people.
The cooking aspects, I definitely will miss.
Top quality.
With baking, you have to follow the rules.
The prayer life, the rules that a priest is supposed to live by, that really excites me.
