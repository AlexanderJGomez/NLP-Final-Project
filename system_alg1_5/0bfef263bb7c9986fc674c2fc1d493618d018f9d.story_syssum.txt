This year's E3, as the annual trade show is better known, arrives during a time of upheaval for the multibillion-dollar gaming industry, which is scrambling to adapt to changing consumer habits.
"I think we may be seeing the last generation of dedicated handheld gaming systems with the PS Vita and Nintendo 3DS," said Blair Herter, co-host G4TV's "X-Play."
As an industry-only event, E3 is geared toward gaming media, developers and insiders.
While the Wii U was previewed in more primitive form at last year's E3, there have reportedly been some changes in how the console looks and what it can do.
At last year's E3, Nintendo showed a Wii U video demo featuring gameplay from Xbox 360 and PlayStation games.
At E3, both Sony and Microsoft will be focusing on new software for their current systems.
"Little Big Planet Karting," a racing game featuring Sackboy, and "PlayStation All Stars Battle Royale," a fighting game with some of Sony's top characters, are likely to be announced next week as part of cross-platform gameplay with the PlayStation 3.
On the software front for the Xbox 360, "Halo 4" will be showcased in a four-hour event with its new developer, 343 Industries, and the return of Master Chief as the main character.
While "Halo 4" is one of the biggest titles at E3, it is far from the only hotly anticipated game.
One, "Defiance" (Trion Worlds), features a unique tie-in with a new sci-fi TV series, where what happens on the show can affect what happens in the game.
Rockstar, developer for the game, said it has no plans for the show, although some watchers speculate that could change at the last minute.
Gamers, what are you hoping to see at E3?
