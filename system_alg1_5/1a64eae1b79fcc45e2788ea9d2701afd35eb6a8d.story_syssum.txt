Surely, there's a silver lining to these snow clouds though, right?
Many drought-stricken states need a foot of rain, not snow.
Lake City, Minnesota, has received 11.5 inches of snow since Sunday morning, which amounts to about an inch of rain.
Comparatively, Minnesota doesn't have it that bad, according to U.S. Drought Monitor.
Oklahoma and Kansas will keep more of the moisture the snow left behind, because the ground there isn't frozen, said meteorologist Joel Widenor.
With global warming, "we're loading the dice or stacking the deck toward more intense blizzards," he said.
Snowfall has bolstered water levels on the Mississippi River, which had dropped due to drought, said Ann McCulloch, spokeswoman for American Waterways Operators.
But by the time the storm gets there, it could turn to rain.
In the parched Plains states, snow hasn't helped enough.
