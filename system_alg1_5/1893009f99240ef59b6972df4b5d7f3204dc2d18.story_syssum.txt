"It signifies the beginning of the process that will hopefully make him whole," said his lawyer, Taylor Koss.
"It has been a struggle since he got out," Koss said, adding that the damages Fleming is seeking include the loss of wages, companionship and emotional anguish.
But, according to Koss, they did not have evidence he was in Florida on the day of the slaying.
In the course of the investigation, the Conviction Review Unit found the receipt in police records, time stamped and dated -- solidifying Fleming's claim that he was in Florida at the time of the crime, according to the district attorney's office.
According to Koss, the woman recanted her testimony weeks after Fleming's conviction.
She said police persuaded her to give a statement against Fleming to avoid going back to jail.
