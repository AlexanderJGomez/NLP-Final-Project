(CNN) -- A Canadian subsidiary of a U.S.-based multinational firm pleaded guilty in federal court Thursday to illegally sending software to China, which it used in the development of its first advanced attack helicopter, according to the U.S. attorney in Connecticut.
"We must be very careful that the helicopter programs we are doing with the Chinese are not presented or viewed as military programs," the manager's e-mail read, according to the documents.
Chinese officials allegedly "made it clear that if (Pratt & Whitney Canada) wanted to have its engines considered for the yet-to-be-developed civil version, it would have to provide its engines ... with the understanding that the initial application ... would be military," the documents added.
It is capable of being equipped with 30 mm cannons, anti-tank and air-to-air missiles, and is primarily intended as an anti-armor attack craft, according to federal officials.
