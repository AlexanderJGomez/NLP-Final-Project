"One of 'em, I think, is Sen. Chuck Hagel."
McCain loaned his star power to Hagel's first Senate campaign in 1996, traveling to appear with him in Nebraska.
"When I see them on the floor of the Senate or somewhere in the Capitol, I feel a little lift," he said.
Later that year, Hagel introduced McCain on the stage of the party's convention with a giant embrace.
By McCain's 2008 presidential run, Hagel was more in line with McCain's anti-Iraq war opponent Barack Obama.
Afterward, McCain said he had concerns about Hagel's positions on Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan.
