"This is not only good for Shenhua but also beneficial for Chinese football," club spokesperson Ma Yue told CNN.
In 2008, Anelka moved to Chelsea in a Â£15 million deal from Bolton, where he resurrected his career after a short spell in Turkey with Fenerbahce.
Meanwhile, Shenhua owner Zhu Jun said last week that former France international Jean Tigana will become the club's new coach, according to the Shanghai Daily website.
Shenhua finished 11th in the 16-team Chinese Super League this year, having been runners-up in 2005, 2006 and 2008.
