Global capitalism is a juggernaut, with the world economy now doubling in size every generation.
Instead, untrammeled greed also leads to massive fraud, mega-tax evasion, pervasive bribery, modern slavery, rising inequalities, and environmental destruction.
Perhaps most important, it feeds moral blindness.
Novelists, ethicists, activists, unionists, preachers, teachers, and others have long known these facts, but the juggernaut has proved hard to tame.
Thus, sustainable development calls for a holistic approach that combines economic, social, and environmental objectives.
Last year was the Earth's hottest year on record, and another year of mega-storms, droughts, floods, and heat waves.
It turns out that with goodwill, cooperation, greed kept in check, and technological savvy, we can build a modern global economy that is productive, inclusive, and environmentally sustainable all at the same time.
And doubters about the feasibility of sustainable development should have a look at Scandinavia Â¬ Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, as they are the closest on the planet to achieving this Trifecta of prosperity, fairness, and sustainability.
And, more generally, although the U.S. political system still feeds untrammeled greed by enabling super-rich campaign donors and lobbyists to buy the political class, the American people and much of the rest of the world are coming to recognize the urgency of sustainable development.
