Jameel Jaffer says the courts have ruled that refusal to disclose the abuse photos was unlawful.
The Bush administration continued to suppress the photos, and now President Obama has vowed to do the same.
In explaining his change of heart, President Obama said that the release of the photos "would not add any additional benefit" to the ongoing public debate about the abuse of prisoners.
President Obama's statement was meant to explain why the photos would not inform the public debate, but it only underscored why the release of the photographs is so important.
The photos would help tell this story.
President Obama has inherited a legacy of lawlessness and abuse, and it's not easy to untangle that.
And if we fail to learn from this history, we are bound to repeat it.
