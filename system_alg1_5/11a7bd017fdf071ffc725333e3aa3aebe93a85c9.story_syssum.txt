Orta was arrested leaving the hotel after police said they saw him passing an object to his girlfriend, who placed it in her waistband, according to the source.
Police stopped them both and recovered a gun from the girlfriend's waistband, the source said.
Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who is seen on the video choking Garner, was put on modified assignment and stripped of his badge and gun amid the investigation, the New York Police Department said.
The Staten Island district attorney's office said Orta's arraignment will happen Monday.
