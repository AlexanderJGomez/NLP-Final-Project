When the company did not comply, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson announced that the EPA would run its own toxicity tests, the first round of which focused on Corexit 9500 and seven other common, readily available dispersants from the agency's approved list.
"We need more data before we decide whether to change dispersants," said Paul T. Anastas, the EPA's assistant administrator for research and development.
As for human health, scientists say much more needs to be learned about dispersants -- their behavior with oil, chemical ingredients, chronic and delayed effects -- to understand the risks.
In fact, there are conflicting data," said Denison.
The fact that they are being asked now, and we don't have answers, is of particular concern given the magnitude and scale of use of dispersant."
I don't think we have enough data to answer those questions very well, and I'm hoping that this tragedy will spur us to answer those questions so we'll have enough information next time."
