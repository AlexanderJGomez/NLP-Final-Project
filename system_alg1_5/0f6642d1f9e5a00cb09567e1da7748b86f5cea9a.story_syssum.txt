NEW YORK (CNN) -- After a nearly year-long investigation, police say they now believe 10 sets of human remains uncovered along a desolate stretch of Long Island, New York, beach are linked to a single killer.
In June, police upped the ante in their search for a culprit.
But the woman whose disappearance triggered the searches, 23-year-old Shannan Gilbert, remains missing.
They, like Gilbert, had advertised for prostitution services on websites such as Craigslist.
