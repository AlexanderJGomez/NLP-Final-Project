Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Yemeni Vice President Abdurabu Mansur Hadi kicked off his presidential campaign Tuesday, announcing he will run in the February 21 election.
The power transfer deal, signed in November, states that Saleh's deputy would succeed him in power for a term of two years.
Hadi praised the demonstrators, most of whom are youths, saying they all along had hoped to see a new future for the country.
"Our main goal during our revolution is to oust Ali Saleh from power.
This will be accomplished in two weeks, but his family is still in control of the country's military," said Sanaa youth activist Mohammed Hashem.
