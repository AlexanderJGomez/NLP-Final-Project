Egypt will elect a president before voting on a parliament, interim President Adly Mansour said Sunday, amending a road map laid down last summer.
The country has seen months of political turmoil since its first democratically elected president, Morsy of the Muslim Brotherhood, was deposed by the military and an interim, military-backed government was installed in his place.
The organization Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, which the United States has designated a terrorist group, said in a statement that it was targeting Cairo's security headquarters and security forces.
Morsy's supporters have held held near-daily protests since his ouster, demanding he be reinstated.
Mansour also said he appealed to prosecutors to review the cases of detainees held without charges from protests, including university students, to ensure that those held for no reason are released.
