It's simple: do the things that others aren't willing to do.
It's just easier to put it off.
Do it scared.
Fear is one of the biggest saboteurs of our goals, because it inhibits action.
Until one fireman said: "that's OK, just do it scared."
Just do something.
Habits, not results.
In time, success will follow.
When you feel frustrated, depressed, or disappointed, don't give up -- just get some perspective.
Then, I pull it away and look at it in its entirety.
Today's challenges may not make sense, but you must have faith that over the long-term, they will be nothing more than blips on the radar screen.
And when you develop the habit of doing things that others won't do, you're putting yourself on the fast track to the route to the top.
