In Ukraine, the neighboring state besieged by Putin's forces, someone reportedly left a large funeral wreath at the gate of the Russian embassy.
A handwritten message addressed Putin with an expletive, telling him, "Thank you for croaking."
On Thursday, Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the President would miss his regular meeting with the Federal Security Service (FSB).
The Swiss magazine Blick said Putin is in Lugano, where his girlfriend just gave birth to their baby.
There are even suggestions that he went off to join ISIS, or is playing hide-and-seek a la Where's Waldo.
Putin is the state.
Putin rules in the old-fashioned style of a personality cult.
The recent murder of Boris Nemtsov, Putin's foremost critic, has spawned fears that there is a hit list, a roster of Putin critics whose days are numbered.
In those days, there was usually a succession plan.
Putin's mentor, President Boris Yeltsin, also had a history of "disappearing" from view.
Even if Putin is in perfect health and the social media whirlwind turns out to have just been an outlet for creativity, talk of Putin's disappearance raises important questions.
Whatever Putin is doing at this exact moment -- whether he is hunting tigers, visiting with friends, or convalescing from an illness -- and no matter what he does in the days ahead, the Internet tempest of the past few days is a reminder that the man who embodies today's Russian state, who dismantled the country's once-fledgling democracy, won't be around forever.
