CNN spoke with Macy Friday over the phone Thursday.
I was just like, 'Wow.'
And then, she came out and she is like, 'Hey you.'
Macy: Well, I love it.
CNN: You are 10.
Macy: I didn't know, too, too, too much.
Macy: Oh gosh, well, Selena Gomez, Katy Perry, probably Michelle Obama and Barack Obama.
Probably One Direction.
Macy: Yes, totally.
Macy: Thank you.
