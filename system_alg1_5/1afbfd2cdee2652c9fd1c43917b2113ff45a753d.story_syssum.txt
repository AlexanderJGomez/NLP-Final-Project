It's rooted in distrust of the President, especially on immigration.
With the door closed to any action on immigration reform this year with midterm campaigning in full swing, Congress and Obama now face a crisis around that issue, which Republicans do not want to touch as it's politically charged and complex.
Republicans also balked at the size of Obama's request, which was twice what they anticipated.
"What disappoints me so much is he's asking for a blank check," Texas Sen. John Cornyn said.
While Democrats indicate they support Obama's request, they want more details before signing off.
"We just can't just trust the President and say we are going to give you exactly every penny you want," Rep. Henry Cuellar, whose South Texas district is one heavily impacted by the current crisis, told CNN.
Instead, they must be treated humanely, turned over to the Health and Human Services Department, and given an immigration hearing to determine if they qualify for asylum.
I trust this president but I want to verify," Durbin said.
