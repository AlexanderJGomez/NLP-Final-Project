At the restaurant, witnesses said Richardson was exhibiting strange behavior including "sitting down with strangers and speaking in gibberish," according to the lawsuit filed Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court by Richardson's mother, Latice Sutton.
"It was not just the money," Peterson said.
"It was clearly evident that from the time [Richardson] arrived at Geoffrey's to the time of her arrest, she was not in her correct mental state," the lawsuit says.
"I feel I have no other alternative," Sutton said.
