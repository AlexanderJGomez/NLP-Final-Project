At least four of the Islamist attackers also were killed as Somali police and AU troops responded to the assault on the police station in Beledweyne, about 200 miles north of the Somali capital of Mogadishu, said Abdi Farah Laqanyo, governor of the Hiran region.
A spokesman for Al-Shabaab's military operations, Sheikh Abdiaziz Abu Musab, said the group carried out the attack.
The witness, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a plume of black smoke rose from the police station.
Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for September's four-day siege at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, where at dozens of people were killed.
