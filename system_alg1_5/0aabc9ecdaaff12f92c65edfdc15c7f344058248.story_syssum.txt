"Emotionally, the remnants of that stay for a long time," she said.
Abuse can influence a victim's future behavior in relationships and even in friendships, depending on whether the victim stays or leaves, said Mark Crawford, a clinical psychologist based in Roswell, Georgia.
"What they need to do when they get out of the relationship is make sure they're aware of their own anger, and then they can learn how to freely express it in a healthy, normal way," he said.
"Not just ongoing violence, which everybody thinks about, but even when it's over, there's something about what happens that seems to have a lingering effect that we don't quite understand yet," said Dr. Anuradha Paranjape, co-author of the study and associate professor at Temple University School of Medicine.
Women who have been abused prior to, but not during, the past five years had depression rates 1Â½ times greater than those without abuse experience, said Bonomi, who has collaborated with Dimer on research on abused women.
A 2008 study of 3,333 women, which Bonomi worked on, found that middle-aged women who suffered child abuse, sexual or other physical abuse, had a greater likelihood of depression, as well as a higher body mass index.
"When your patient says they don't feel so good, you might want to think about asking what other issues may be going on," she said.
Some women do feel stronger having been through the experience of abuse, Dimer said.
