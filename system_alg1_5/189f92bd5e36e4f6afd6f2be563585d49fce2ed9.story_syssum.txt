In responding to this evolution of gamers, the companies say they have very distinct ideas about who they want to reach and how.
"We're going to be where the consumers are and, right now, they are basically everywhere," said Patrick Soderlund, executive vice president of EA Games Label, referring to the growth of mobile and social gaming.
"We treat our games as a service," he said.
"'Escape Plan' is a good example of what I think we are going to see more of -- unique, Vita-specific content," he added, referring to the puzzle game that launched with the Vita.
said David Dennis, Xbox product manager.
"People like to play good games," Hines said.
"I think people are going for deeper and longer experiences," he said.
So whether you want to spend hours gaming on a TV screen or just minutes on a smartphone, E3 is poised to show you new experiences.
