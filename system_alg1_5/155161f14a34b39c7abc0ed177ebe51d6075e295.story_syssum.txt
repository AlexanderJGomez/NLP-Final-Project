A maintenance worker, checking on complaints about the hotel's water, found the Canadian tourist inside one of four water cisterns.
Lam checked into the Cecil Hotel on January 26, on her way to Santa Cruz, California, according to police in her hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia.
Strange things began happening with the hotel's water supply later in the month, according to Sabina and Michael Baugh, a British couple who spent eight days there.
"It had a very funny, sweety, disgusting taste.
"We never thought anything of it," she said.
