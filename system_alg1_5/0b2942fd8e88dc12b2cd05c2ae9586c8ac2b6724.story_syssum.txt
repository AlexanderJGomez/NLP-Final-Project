As political stunts go, Boehner's is too transparent for my tastes.
Boehner's not a bad guy.
Highly influential conservative blogger and pundit Erick Erickson calls the Boehner lawsuit "taxpayer-funded political theater" and notes that some of Boehner's complaints about Obama are political, not legal or constitutional.
Now, here's the depressing part: Boehner's sue first, ask questions later strategy just might work.
Obviously, I can't get into Boehner's head.
On the other hand, progressives would do well to assume there is a method to Boehner's madness.
Unable to marshal the votes to get their legislative agenda through the Senate and unable to earn the votes to recapture the White House, it may be that the Republicans' strategy for the foreseeable future is to ignore their losses at the ballot box and leave the heavy lifting to the one place where five Republican votes can cancel out tens of millions of Americans' votes: the Supreme Court.
