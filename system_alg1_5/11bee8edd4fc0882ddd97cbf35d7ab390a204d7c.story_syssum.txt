Nope.
Because, the plaintiff claims, he was injured when he tried Dr. Oz' home sleep remedy known as the "Knapsack Heated Rice Footsie."
Her complaint alleged that she was misled by the movie's trailer which promised "Fast and the Furious" type driving, which, alas, the film didn't deliver.
And that brings us to Dr. Oz.
However, Dr. Oz expressly warned viewers, "Don't get it too hot, just warm."
The plaintiff also claims that Dr. Oz should have offered a specific warning to avoid using this remedy to people who, like him, have diabetes and hence less feeling in their feet.
Blame the lawyers.
Consequently, I'm a bit biased against plaintiffs' lawyers.
If they don't, the government will do it for them under the guise of "tort reform."
As for Dr. Oz, I hope that he doesn't settle quickly out of court.
In all likelihood he will prevail.
