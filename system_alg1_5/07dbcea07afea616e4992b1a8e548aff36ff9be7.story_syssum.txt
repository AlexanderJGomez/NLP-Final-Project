It's called "Smile Pinki," and it's up for an Oscar, too -- nominated for best short documentary, which it won on Sunday.
Pinki was born with a cleft lip, and her impoverished family did not have the money for corrective surgery.
"Pinki was a depressed, sad, lonely, shy, young little girl, growing up on the periphery of the society in a little village," said Satish Kalra, director of Smile Train's South Asian region, after meeting with Pinki.
"She has absolutely and totally changed," said Pinki's surgeon, Dr. Subodh Kumar.
For Pinki and her dad, being able to see the film's director win an Oscar would be a thrill.
