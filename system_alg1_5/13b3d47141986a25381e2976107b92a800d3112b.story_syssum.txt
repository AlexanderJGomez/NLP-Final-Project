(CNN) -- Insomnia, the inability to fall or stay asleep, can make the days feel fuzzy and the nights never-ending.
Over the last two decades, doctors treating sleep disorders have prescribed more antidepressants than insomnia drugs, according to several published analyses.
Depending on the patient's circumstances, a doctor might prescribe antidepressants as the primary treatment for insomnia; for example, if there is a history of addiction.

There's "a lot of inappropriate prescribing for insomnia," said Rajesh Balkrishnan, the director of the Center for Medication Use, Policy, and Economics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
Side effects for antidepressants can include headache, night sweats, nausea, agitation, sexual problems and dry mouth.

Unlike drugs, this method has no side effects.
Jackson requested an anesthetic, saying, "I just want to get some sleep.
"Propofol induces coma, it does not induce sleep," said Dr. Hector Vila, chairman of the Ambulatory Surgery Committee for the American Society of Anesthesiologists.
