Chelsea, owned by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, already has an international fanbase but can now also capitalize on the following of Sauber's drivers -- Mexican Sergio Perez and Kamui Kobayashi of Japan.
In either case we are talking about team sport at the highest -- and international -- level," said Sauber chief executive Monisha Kaltenborn.
"We felt that this Swiss team, the fourth oldest of the existing teams, reflects our own ideals perfectly," Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay said.
"This partnership will benefit us both greatly, with the potential to create unique commercial opportunities," Gourlay said.
