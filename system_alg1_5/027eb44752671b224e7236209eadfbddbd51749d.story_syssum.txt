MUMBAI, India (CNN) -- Inside the blacked-out Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, hallways were littered with bloodied bodies.
Through it all, the commandos walked down pitch-black halls, trying to navigate the damaged hotel without knowing the layout.
"We did not know the layout of the hotel," the commando told reporters.
The moment they saw us, they hurled grenades."
The attackers had a clear advantage, commandos said, because it was apparent from their movements they knew the hotel's layout.
As the commandos approached one of the rooms, attackers opened fire at them and said all the people in the room were dead.
But the attackers knew all the doors, he said.
"Let me tell you one thing," the commando said.
In trying to rescue hostages and trapped civilians, commandos had to convince guests they were there to help, not terrorists trying to trick them, Indian Army Lt. Gen. Noble Thamburaj said.
Once they arrived, the sources said, commandos had no precise maps of the hotel layout or its access points.
While local police and other officers were at the scene, the sources said, the commandos and army special force units are the only ones equipped and trained to rescue hostages.
