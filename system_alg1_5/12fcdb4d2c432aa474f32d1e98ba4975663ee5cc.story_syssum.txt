The park is a supervolcano so enormous, it has puzzled geophysicists for decades, but now a research group, using seismic technology to scan its depths, have made a bombshell discovery.
The magma chamber, which scientists already knew about, lies on top of the reservoir -- and draws magma from it.
Also, the discovery doesn't mean that there is now more magma than there was before, the scientists say.
But when it does blow, it probably will change the world.
Mount Pinatubo, which exploded in the Philippines in 1991, doesn't begin to scratch the surface of Yellowstone's roar.
Yellowstone has dwarfed that at least three times, the USGS says.
Long before that, 2 million years ago, volcanic activity blew 600 cubic miles of Yellowstone debris into the air.
So, it's no wonder scientists have cast an eye on Yellowstone for a while.
The upper chamber, which caused the historic blasts and is closest to the surface, is 2,500 cubic miles in volume and measures about 19 by 55 miles.
So, national park authorities closed Yellowstone to keep people from burning their feet -- or basting their tires on melting roads.
