The TSA uses the hijab to profile Muslim women, and passengers can now expect a full-body pat-down, an appallingly invasive "enhanced pat-down search  that could include the chest and groin, or a planned "mind-scan"  that would track people's reaction to terrorist symbols.
It's hard for me too.
Muslims don't drink alcohol and are, therefore, exempt.
I agree.
Even if racial profiling doesn't affect us, it affects our friends, family members, co-workers, doctors, television personalities --  the list goes on.
The Quran says, "[God has] made you into nations and tribes, so that you might come to know one another (49:13)."
Psychologist Henri Tajfel, who was a Holocaust survivor, explained  how we isolate ourselves into an "in-group" and facilitate discrimination of an "out-group."
The TSA needs to stop and evaluate methods that are more effective, less invasive, and don't discriminate based on religion or race.
