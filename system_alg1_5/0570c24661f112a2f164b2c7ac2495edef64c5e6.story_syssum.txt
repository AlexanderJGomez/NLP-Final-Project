Frankly, I despaired of working with the government, thinking it would be extremely challenging to work with.
But when I asked friends and colleagues who had lived there for advice, they spoke highly of the country and her people.
Rwanda's countryside is dotted with what appear to be literally a thousand hills that are a mixture of mountains, volcanoes and hillocks.
For anyone who has spent time in Africa, it's incredible to see people actually wearing helmets on motorcycles, drivers and passengers alike, both in Kigali and in the countryside.
From them came the concept of Umuganda, or community service.
Four months after my arrival, I was ready to see the Kigali Genocide Memorial.
One room tells the tale of other genocides or "cleansing" events in history around the world, reminding us that the international community has not been diligent about the oft-quoted pledge, "Never again."
But I know from what I had seen, and from my organization's work, that it is possible.
Witnessing these scenes is almost surreal, but deeply moving and humbling.
When Rwandans say "never again," I believe them.
I attribute a lot of that to the strong will, the leadership and most importantly, to the resiliency of the Rwandan people.
And we can, with a little influence and a lot of political will.
