The father, Justin Ross Harris, has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and second-degree child cruelty.
Justin Harris, 33, won't be allowed out of the Cobb County Jail to attend, sheriff's office spokeswoman Nancy Bodiford said.
The funding of the funeral from the Home Depot charity, the Homer Fund, is a "standard approach," she said.
"The chain of events that occurred in this case does not point toward simple negligence, and evidence will be presented to support this allegation," said Cobb County Police Chief John House.
But that day, police said, Harris left him in the car seat.
During his lunch break, he returned to his car, opening the driver's side door to put something inside, police said.
Each year, dozens of children die from heat strokes in cars, according to KidsandCars.org.
Another, set up at YouCaring.com, has raised more than $22,000 for the Harris family.
As Harris sits in jail, his wife, Leanna, would not discuss the case with the media.
