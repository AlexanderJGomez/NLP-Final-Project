During the course of Sunday's episode, faithful "Good Wife" viewers had to say goodbye to Josh Charles' character, Will Gardner, who was killed in a plot twist no one saw coming.
"To us, there always was a tragedy at the center of Will and Alicia's relationship: the tragedy of bad timing," the Kings said.
Well, the Kings say, "we've all experienced the sudden death of a loved one in our lives.
'The Good Wife' is a show about human behavior and emotion, and death, as sad and unfair as it can be, is a part of the human experience that we want to share."
