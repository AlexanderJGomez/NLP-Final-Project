Near term, Russia holds the cards.
Longer term, Russia has much more to lose.
If Europe finds substitutes for its oil and gas, Russia simply would not be able to pay for the Western products it has become accustomed to buying.
Unless the West can impose significant costs on Russia for its aggressive policies, reduce Europe's vulnerability to a natural gas embargo and curtail Moscow's financial resources, it can count on Russia asserting military power when its leaders perceive threats to Russian interests in neighboring states.
Russia could easily retaliate against U.S. and European investments in petroleum, autos, banking, and other sectors.
Russians could try to sell more natural gas in Asia, but those prospects are limited.
The high cost of liquefying and shipping U.S. gas to Europe requires that Europe also develop its own resources to fully unyoke itself from dependence on Russia and limit their strategic vulnerability.
