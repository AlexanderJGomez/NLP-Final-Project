"Doctor Strange" is scheduled for release November 4, 2016.
The new Captain America film, "Captain America: Civil War," will be released May 6, 2016.
In addition, Marvel announced a two-part "Avengers" film, "Avengers: Infinity War," due in 2018 and 2019.
"Guardians," which came out in August, is the biggest-grossing film of the year.
"If it were confirmed, we would have introduced him today," Feige said at the news conference.
