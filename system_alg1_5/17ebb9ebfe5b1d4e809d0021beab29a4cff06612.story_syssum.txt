Until a few days ago, Fares was Syria's top man in Baghdad.
"I was at the top of the Syrian regime," Fares said in his first interview with a U.S.-based TV network since his defection.
"But I wasn't successful, so I decided to join the people."
CNN cannot independently verify reports from Syria, including Fares' allegations, because the nation has restricted access by international journalists.
"But we cannot put him in a political position (in the opposition) ... no one will accept Tlas or Fares at the head of the movement," Ghalioun added.
Like Fares, Tlas is a Sunni Muslim who once held a high rank in an Alawite-dominated regime.
There is friendship between us," said Fares.
"The Syrian regime felt threatened and felt that it, too, might fall," Fares recalled.
One of these "safe havens," Fares said, was the Syrian border village of al Sukariya, near the border city of Abu Kamal.
"This was a hiding place for al-Qaeda on the border with Iraq, and it was under the control of Assif Shawkat, the brother-in-law of the president," Fares said.
A conversation took place between me and him ... and he was angry about the attack made against al Sukariya and he was kind of scared," Fares recalled.
There is still time," Fares said.
... History will curse you for the crimes you committed in Syria."
