"Who [Meleanie Hain] is does not change the course of this investigation," he said.
Meleanie Hain's attorney, Matthew B. Weisberg, said she told him a few months ago that she and her husband were separating.

Weisberg, Hain's attorney, said the sheriff's action violated Hain's First, Second, Fourth and 14th Amendment rights.
"It's shocking," Weisberg said of the shooting.
