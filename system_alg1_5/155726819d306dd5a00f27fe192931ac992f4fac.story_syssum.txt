The emergency department, they say.
That, of course, is not true.
What's important to remember is that you can't be refused emergency care.
But there's no guarantee of prenatal care in the emergency department.
You can't get preventive care in the emergency department.
And even if you could, it wouldn't be free.
You'll get that emergent care, but you'll also be charged for it.
It might even be worse in North Carolina, where a group of nonprofit hospitals sued 40,000 patients from 2005 to 2010.
Before you get all riled up, I understand that hospitals need money to run.
So it's true that an emergency room won't let you die if you show up at the door, but short of that, you can't get care for a host of medical issues.
That's a far cry from universal health care, and nothing to brag about.
