"They have to pass it," Kerry said.
If approved, the agreement would go into effect January 1, 2015, and last "until the end of 2024 and beyond, unless terminated" by mutual agreement and with two years notice by either party, according to a copy of the deal posted online Wednesday by the Afghan government that a U.S. official confirms is authentic.
"I don't know where the idea of an apology started," Kerry said.
The U.S. military "shall have the exclusive right" to discipline and prosecute its members for alleged acts committed on Afghan soil, according to the tentative deal, though Afghan authorities can ask that anyone be taken out of the country.
Kerry used similar language in calling the U.S. military's role in Afghanistan "very limited," adding "it is entirely (to) train, equip and assist" Afghan forces.
