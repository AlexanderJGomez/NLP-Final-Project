"Fortunately, the prompt actions of the Somali National Army, assisted by AMISOM forces (African Union Mission in Somalia), quickly halted the attack," said government spokesman Mustafa Duhulow.
"Bomb disposal personnel have rendered safe a number of devices, including a suicide vest that one attacker was wearing that had failed to detonate," Dhulow said.
"Incidents such as this further demonstrate that insecurity in Mogadishu persists, including very real threats from al-Shabaab," the statement said.
The group aims to establish Islamic rule in Somalia, though it has carried out attacks in other African countries, as well.
