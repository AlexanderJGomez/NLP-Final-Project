She is the author of a memoir, "Wrapped In Blue: A Journey of Self-Discovery."
Rather, it is our heart and spirit that defines us.
We're a cross-section of society -- pilots, engineers, doctors, factory workers, artisans and pretty much anything else you can imagine.
We are everyone, everywhere.
This is a journey that each of us is on -- trans and not -- and the simple fact of the matter is that the transgender journey may appear unique, but the end goal is a universal one: Happiness.
Our defense is a simple one: We prove who we are, individually and collectively, not with words but with the courage to come out and the ability to live our lives with dignity and grace.
This is not a journey about surgery.
It is a journey of self, full of uplifting revelations and heartbreaking realizations.
Things are changing -- slowly but surely.
Because transgender people are here to stay.
These are not things to fear.
That is not something to fear.
