(MentalFloss.com) -- On Memorial Day, we thought it might be a good time to take a look at some of the rules for respectfully displaying the American flag, as dictated by the United States Flag Code.
Section 6 of the flag code states, "The flag should be displayed on all days."
The flag code thought of that one, too.
The flag code thought of that one, too.
While the code states, "The flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise," there's no rule saying that a flag that slips has to immediately be burned.
In these instances, the church's flag may fly above the American flag during the service.
As part of the United States Code, the flag code is technically federal law.
Congress responded by passing the Flag Protection Act, which made flag desecration a federal crime.
On Memorial Day, the flag flies at half-staff until noon, at which point it is raised to the top of the staff.
It won't be an overnight process, though.
