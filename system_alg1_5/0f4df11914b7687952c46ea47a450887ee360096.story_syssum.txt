Nearly two out of three of the world's Muslims are in Asia, stretching from Turkey to Indonesia.
There are about 1.57 billion Muslims in the world, according to the report, "Mapping the Global Muslim Population," by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life.
Brian Grim, the senior researcher on the Pew Forum project, was slightly surprised at the number of Muslims in the world, he told CNN.
"If the goal is to create better understanding between the United States and the Muslim world, our focus should be on south and southeast Asia, not the Middle East," he said.
"In the rest of Europe -- Russia, Albania, Kosovo, those places -- Muslims are an indigenous population," he said.
Islam is thought to be growing fast in the region, with countries such as Nigeria, which has large populations of both Christians and Muslims, seeing violence between the two groups.
If asked, large numbers will say I am just a Muslim -- not that they don't know, but it is a sensitive question in many places," he said.
"We don't care only about Muslims," Grim said.
"This is no way reflects the religiosity of people, only their self-identification," Grim said.
