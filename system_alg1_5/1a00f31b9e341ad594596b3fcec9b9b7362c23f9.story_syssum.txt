But as the mobile industry meets in Barcelona this week, there are many reasons to feel optimistic about mobile's benefit to advertisers.
I think not.
Yet if we include tablets within mobile media, we can predict that mobile advertising will surpass traditional digital spending by 2016.
The mobile landscape is fast-paced and will continue to evolve, meaning existing and new challenges will continue to provoke the industry.
So mobile will certainly challenge digital.
Finally, mobile is more personal, more social and more local than any other media.
So back to the question, will mobile kill digital advertising?
