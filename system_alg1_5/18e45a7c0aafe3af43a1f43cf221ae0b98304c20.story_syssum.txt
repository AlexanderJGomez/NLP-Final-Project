The violence occurred shortly before the match, but the game between Zamalek and ENPPI  teams continued,  Al-Ahram newspaper said.
Shortly after the incident, soccer fans traded accusations with the Interior Ministry, which blamed the violence on riots from ticketless fans who tried to push their way in.
But Zamalek fans painted a different picture.
After that incident, Egypt banned soccer fans from games.
Authorities later partially lifted the ban by allowing a limited number of fans to attend games, state media reported.
