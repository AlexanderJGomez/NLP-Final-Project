HAMILTON, Bermuda (CNN) -- Four Chinese nationals of Uyghur ethnicity who had been held at the U.S. military's Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility have been resettled in Bermuda, officials said Thursday.
President Obama has pledged to close the Guantanamo facility, raising questions of what will happen to the more than 200 remaining detainees.
The 17 Uyghurs had left China and made their way to Afghanistan, where they settled in a camp with other Uyghurs opposed to the Chinese government, the Justice Department said in its statement.
They left China because they did not agree with the government, she told CNN.
The Chinese statement followed an offer by Palau, a Pacific island nation, to accept the Uyghur detainees.
China has said no returned Uyghurs would be tortured.
In 2006, five other Uyghur detainees were transferred to Albania, according to the Justice Department, which said it has no reports they took part in any post-resettlement criminal behavior or terrorist activities.
