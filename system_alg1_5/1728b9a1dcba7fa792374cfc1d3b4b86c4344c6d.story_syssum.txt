Helg Sgarbi has admitted blackmailing Germany's richest woman, Susanne Klatten.
Authorities said Klatten, who is married with three children, had an affair with Sgarbi.
At the time, her spokesman, Joerg Appelhans, told CNN that Sgarbi's goal had always been to con her.
Klatten, the daughter of the late BMW chief Herbert Quandt, holds a 12.5-percent stake in the German carmaker and a 51.1-percent share of chemical company Altana.
