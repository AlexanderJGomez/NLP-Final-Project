The first lady turns 50 on Friday, and it's being reported that she will be serenaded by singer Beyonce for the occasion.
Michelle Obama responded, "@Beyonce Thank you for the beautiful letter and for being a role model who kids everywhere can look up to.
Obama."
"When BeyoncÃ© goes into the studio to record an album for her millions of fans, she's not thinking about her friendship with the first lady; she's thinking about what's hot, what's edgy, and what will sell to the masses," Samuels wrote.
Powerful friends can attract powerful opinions.
