The Washington Post broke the story Thursday, and the Air Force now confirms that body fragments linked to at least 274 fallen military personnel sent to the Dover Air Force Base Mortuary were cremated, incinerated and buried with medical waste.
"For years, this has been handled unceremoniously and insensitively and, I would say, dishonorably," Holt said in a telephone interview.
They don't understand the degree of dishonor involved in all of this," Holt said.
Since the policy was changed in 2008, the unclaimed body parts are buried at sea.
"That makes us proud to be an American, that we would do that," Holt said.
"I think the secretary is comfortable with the way the Air Force has handled this," said Pentagon spokesman Capt.
"The secretary supports the recent Air Force investigation and he wants to see all of this move forward in a way that allows the Air Force to do its work and to avoid the kinds of lapses we did witness, and those lapses were regrettable," Little said.
"We regret any additional grief to the families past practices may have caused," said Air Force Lt. Gen. Darrell Jones, deputy Air Force chief of staff.
"It is certainly not the way we would have done it, looking back," Jones said.
