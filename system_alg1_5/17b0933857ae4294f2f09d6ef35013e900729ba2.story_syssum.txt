Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan was released from home confinement at 10:20 a.m. Wednesday, 35 days after she began serving her sentence for misdemeanor theft and probation violation, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County sheriff said Wednesday.
"I am not happy about house arrest," Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Saunter said during a hearing last week.
Her supervised probation is scheduled to end within a year, unless Lohan is charged with breaking any laws before then.
Lohan entered drug rehab last year to avoid a jail sentence imposed by another judge.
Lohan tested positive for alcohol use, a violation of probation rules, in February, the report said.
