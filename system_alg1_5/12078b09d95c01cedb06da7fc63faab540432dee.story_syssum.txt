I see the revolution in the eyes of sterling scientists, previously reluctant to dip a toe into this heavily stigmatized world, who are diving in head first.
For the first time a majority, 53%, favor its legalization, with 77% supporting it for medical purposes.
Among my colleagues, my patients and my friends.
A few years ago, when I told my mother I was investigating the topic for a documentary, I was met with a long pause.
I waited for the other shoe to drop, but it didn't.
At that moment, I saw a revolution that can bring you to tears.
Just two years later, in "Weed 3," we are eyewitnesses to a revolution in full swing.
This time around, you will hear from the heads of government agencies earnestly sharing their point of view, both Democratic and Republican senators, and even the President of the United States.
In anticipation of a scientific revolution, the production of research-grade marijuana there has increased 30-fold in just the past year.
There is now promising research into the use of marijuana that could impact tens of thousands of children and adults, including treatment for cancer, epilepsy and Alzheimer's, to name a few.
With regard to pain alone, marijuana could greatly reduce the demand for narcotics and simultaneously decrease the number of accidental painkiller overdoses, which are the greatest cause of preventable death in this country.
They want it now.
They want it now.
I needed to remind them that people, long before me or them, have been trying to do many of these same things for 40 years, and had been rejected every time.
It makes sense.
So, here it is: We should legalize medical marijuana.
And, we should do it now.
