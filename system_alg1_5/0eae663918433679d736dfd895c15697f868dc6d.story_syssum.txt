That was the selection made Wednesday by Kwasi Enin, the New York high school student accepted by the eight Ivy League schools -- Harvard, Yale, Brown, Columbia, University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth, Princeton and Cornell.
"We are grateful for all the inspiration," he said.
He's also ranked 11th in his class at William Floyd High School, a public school on Long Island, according to his principal, Barbara Butler.
"I applied knowing that going to any of the Ivy League schools would be wonderful," Enin told CNN earlier this month.
"He is an incredibly modest, humble and respectable person," Butler said.
"It's quite atypical," Rubin said, adding that most students do not apply to all the Ivy League schools.
"I really liked their sense of family, relationships between undergraduates and professors, and the residential college," he said earlier this month.
"Health care is a prominent field that satisfies people beyond finances and edifies people and is about moral development," he said.
"Follow your passions in high school and not just follow suit for what you think can get you into these schools," he said.
