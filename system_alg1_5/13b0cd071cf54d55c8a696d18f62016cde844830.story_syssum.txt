And that's what led us to where we are today," said Mark Abdollahian, a political scientist and co-creator of Senturion, a large-data predictive analysis model that's used by the U.S. State Department and other governments in predicting, preventing and stopping cycles of violence.
"At that time with societal pressure, Egyptians protesting on the streets and calling for change, the Muslim Brotherhood and Mohammed Morsy were the best credible alternatives to Mubarak," Abdollahian said.
ElBaradei, a former director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency and a Nobel laureate, told CNN on Thursday that Morsy's departure will serve as a "reset," so Egypt can start over in forming a constitution and putting together an inclusive government.
And we need a cohesive society that is tolerant, that respects each other's differences," he said.
"Unfortunately we foresee strong potential for more bloodshed, where regular Egyptians are the casualties -- so the faster the military ensures and delivers the constitutional and democratic reform, the better it is for the people and avoiding a civil conflict," he said.
