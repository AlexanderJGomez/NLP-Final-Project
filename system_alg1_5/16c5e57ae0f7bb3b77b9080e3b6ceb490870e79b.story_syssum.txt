"We are standing behind all the claims we make in support of the products," Trish McKernan, Bayer's global spokeswoman, told CNN.
Bayer's HealthCare division, based in Leverkusen, Germany, researches, manufactures and markets pharmaceutical products.
In its promotions, the company says "emerging research" suggests that selenium might reduce the risk of prostate cancer, the center said.
"It's astounding that a company such as Bayer ... would make such deceptive claims," the center's litigation director, Steve Gardner, told reporters during the same teleconference.
"Bayer Healthcare is doing a disservice to men by misleading them about a protective role for selenium in prostate cancer," they added.
