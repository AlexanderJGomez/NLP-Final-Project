Seattle-based mega-yacht rental business CEO Expeditions usually charges around $100,000 a week to charter their 100+ foot yachts, however, they have introduced a deal waiving the charter fees -- so guests will only need to pay for the running of the vessel.
One of the company's mega-yachts, Katania -- a 100 foot vessel which  Hollywood actress Hilary Swank once chartered, now costs less than $3000 per day.
The company's owner, Bruce Milne, said in a statement that the deal was largely due to the impact of the recession.
Tim Wiltshire, director and sales broker at international yacht company Burgess Yachts, said the charter market wasn't a complete disaster, so he was surprised to see such a discount.
He felt that other larger vessels still warranted their greater price tags.
