It did not, however, recommend a change to Irish law, which prohibits abortion in all cases.
The European court, located in Strasbourg, France, ruled that, by failing to allow the woman to have a lawful abortion in Ireland, the country violated her right to respect for her physical and psychological integrity, which falls under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
While the court condemned the Irish ban, it rejected the complaints of two Irish women who sued along with the Lithuanian national, saying there had been no violation of their human rights.
"Ireland's failure to legislate to protect the rights of women has been clearly exposed by the European Court of Human Rights today," said Mark Kelly, director of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, in a statement.
The government "will have to come forward with proposals, but it will take time," Harney said in an interview, according to the Irish government's website.
Neither avenue, therefore, allowed the woman effective and accessible ways to establish her right to a lawful abortion in Ireland, the court said.
And it must end now," said Marianne Mollmann, women's rights advocacy director at Human Rights Watch.
