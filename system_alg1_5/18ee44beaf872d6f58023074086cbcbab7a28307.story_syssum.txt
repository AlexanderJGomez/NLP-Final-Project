The Nevado del Huila volcano is on orange alert, meaning an eruption is probable within days or weeks, the Colombian Institute of Geology and Mining said last week.
The snow-capped Huila, the highest active volcano in Colombia, last erupted on November 20.
At least six people, including four children, died then.
The Huila volcano, which has a summit of 17,598 feet (5,364 meters), has erupted four times.
Officials already are monitoring the volcano with four stations that detect seismological activity, a video camera, a communications network and a system that measures mudflow, Caracol said.
