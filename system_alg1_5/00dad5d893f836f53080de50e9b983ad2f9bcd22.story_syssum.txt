Fire draws near homes in the Los Angeles-area community of Porter Ranch, California, on Monday.
At least two people have died because of the blazes, which have burned 8,000 acres in the hills and mountains of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, fire and police officials said.
"Winds are causing fire conditions to change by the hour," Schwarzenegger said in a statement released Monday.
Officials have shut two freeways north of Los Angeles and authorities dispatched water-dropping helicopters and more than 200 fire engines as the blaze "started to push toward the city," said John Tripp of the Los Angeles County Fire Department.
The larger of the two fires has charred more than 3,500 acres in the Angeles National Forest, officials said.
That fire destroyed several structures, including about 30 mobile homes in the Lopez Canyon area, said Los Angeles County fire inspector Sam Padilla.
