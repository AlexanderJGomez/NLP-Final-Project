From "The Avengers 2" to "World War Z," CNN Entertainment presents your guide to the biggest, best and buzziest movies of 2013.

"It's otherworldly," Weisz said.
With no more "Harry Potter" or "Twilight," movie studios have been scrambling to create new teen-oriented franchises, and only "The Hunger Games" has caught fire so far.
But hot on the heels of "Catching Fire" are some worthy contenders, including boy-centric "Ender's Game" (out November 1), "The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones" (out August 23), and the first of the Caster Chronicles books to be adapted, "Beautiful Creatures" (out February 13).

"Elysium" (starring Matt Damon, out March 1), "Oblivion" (starring Tom Cruise, out April 19), and "After Earth" (starring Will Smith, out June 7) share common themes, but only the first two seem to blame rampant corporatization and wealth discrepancies instead of nature.
