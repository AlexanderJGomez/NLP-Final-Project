But this Sunday I will be pounding the streets of my hometown Brighton, southern England, having done almost no preparation.
My knees, shins, Achilles and hamstrings hurt the most as the miles mount, and they can only get stronger and more resilient through practice.
However, I hit the wall in both my last two races, and I'm terrified it will happen again this Sunday.
This means I've been trudging along Brighton's seafront, running the gauntlet of its colorful nightlife, such as night-clubbers, stag and hen nights and assorted other lost souls.
Next week I'll tell you how it went.
Most of my longer runs were done in the fortnight before the race -- contradicting the usual advice that you train for three or four months, then ease off, or taper, in the last 10 days or so.
The weather was perfect for running: sunny but fresh, and I in fact enjoyed, yes enjoyed, the whole day.
On Monday I went to work in London and my legs were more stiff but not painful, but I managed to walk three miles.
So I would implore anyone considering a marathon to get out and give it a go: it's really not as hard as you might think.
Sure, 26.2 miles (42 kilometers) is a long way, but as long as you have a decent level of fitness, you'll be able to run a fairly fast marathon.
