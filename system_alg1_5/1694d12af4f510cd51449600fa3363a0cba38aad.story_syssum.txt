The former sheriff, Crum's husband, was shot and killed this week.
"She's a good person," Crawford said about Crum.
Crum has prior no law enforcement experience, but she will have "plenty of help," Baisden said.
"We have the full support of the sheriff's department, right down to every man that we spoke to as a deputy, and their support for this is overwhelming.
She lost her husband, and would have lost a paycheck," he said.
Justin Marcum, an assistant prosecutor in Mingo County, said having Crum step into her husband's shoes should help in the healing process.
It's small town U.S.A., and it will help us overcome the void that's in our hearts," he said.
