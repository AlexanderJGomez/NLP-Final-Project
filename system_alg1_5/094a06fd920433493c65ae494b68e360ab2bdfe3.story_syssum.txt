"As previously authorized by the national board of directors, we will now launch a full-scale education campaign in support of a strike authorization referendum," SAG said in a statement Saturday.
"Let's review the facts: SAG is the only major Hollywood guild that has failed to negotiate a labor deal in 2008," the producers' group said in a Saturday statement.
"Now it's time for SAG members to stand united and empower the national negotiating committee to bargain with the strength of a possible work stoppage behind them," it said.
Approval of a strike referendum, which requires the support of 75 percent of SAG's members, is not a foregone conclusion because Hollywood is still recovering from a costly writers strike that dragged on for 100 days just a year ago.
