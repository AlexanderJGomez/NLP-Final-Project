London (CNN) -- The embattled British tabloid News of the World, one of the oldest and best-selling newspapers in Britain, will shut down after Sunday's issue, its owner, News International, told CNN Thursday.
Coulson has previously insisted that he did not know about widespread phone hacking at the newspaper and offered, last year, to meet with police voluntarily to discuss the case.
"The rug's being pulled out from underneath our feet," said David Wooding, political editor at the News of the World.
In an interview for UK media, James Murdoch said he, his father and the company felt "regret" over what had happened.
All revenue from the paper's final edition will go to "good causes," he said earlier.
On Thursday, shortly before James Murdoch's announcement, police said they have identified the names of nearly 4,000 potential victims.
It's a cash cow that will be subsidizing other papers, certainly The Times."
"It's a recognition that for whatever reason, the News of the World was affecting the public perception of the bid for BSkyB and was likely to make it more difficult, so it was easier and cheaper to close it down," he told CNN.
It's absolutely disgusting what has taken place," Cameron said Wednesday.
"However, in view of the significant public and political concern expressed following the publication of this information," police Thursday "made a formal referral to the IPCC," they said in a statement.
At least five people have been arrested in connection with phone hacking investigations this year since a new investigation, Operation Weeting, was launched in January.
In addition to owning News of the World, News International owns the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times in Britain.
