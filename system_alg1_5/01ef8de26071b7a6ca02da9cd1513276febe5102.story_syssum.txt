Laden McDaniel, a woman who police said was among three Tensas State Bank employees taken hostage on Tuesday, died at Rapides Regional Medical Center, according to Sarah Clancy of the Alexandria, Louisiana, hospital.
Police said Ahmed, 20, was known to police, and Edmonson described him as a paranoid schizophrenic.
Born in California, Ahmed moved with his family to northeastern Louisiana, where his family owns a convenience store, Edmonson said.
Edmonson said he talked to, and prayed with, relatives of the hostages.
