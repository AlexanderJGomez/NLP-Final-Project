Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Fighting continued Monday as rival Libyan militias battled for Tripoli International Airport and the interim government said it was considering asking for international military help.
While Libyan officials have called for calm, the government is weak and militias outnumber and outgun its security forces.
It said any commander that orders attacks on civilian facilities, including the airport, will face charges of murder.
"This is a temporary measure," the United Nations said in a written statement.
The United Nations, which stood by the Libyan people in their revolution in 2011, will not abandon them as they seek to build a democratic state."
All flights in and out of the airport have been suspended.
Armed militias are now the biggest challenge.
