Despite chemotherapy, some breast cancers recur, like a "smoldering fire that flares up," Dr. Otis Brawley said.
By chronic disease, doctors mean "the way we think of diabetes or heart disease as chronic diseases, where people could live in peaceful coexistence with cancer, as opposed to the cancer continuing to advance," said Brawley, who also is CNNhealth.com's conditions expert.
"We need to invest in our efforts in research, in basic research, and also in social science to understand why people behave in a risky way, and how to prevent people from exposing themselves to cancer risk," he said.
But breast cancer can come back even after 10 years, he said.
"I have many patients who will come back and say, 'Except for the fact that you tell me I have cancer, I don't know it,' " he said.
"There is real promise at eventually eradicating breast cancer," she said.
Metastatic lung cancer and metastatic breast cancer, on the other hand, are more likely to one day become "chronic diseases," which would be treated throughout a person's life rather than eliminated, Brawley said.
"I think that all the tools are there -- it's just, we have to do the hard work of testing them, evaluating them, and making them available to patients, Reid said.
