Maybe Twitter can tell us.
The "tweets" range from the mundane to the profound, and convey, for example, what people are doing, thinking and reading at any moment.
We also observe geographic variations, with users from Hawaii, California, and Florida, for example, using happier words in their tweets.
However, because we take words out of context, our approach will not correctly interpret tweets like "I am not happy".
Because most users leave their tweets public, Twitter represents an unprecedented opportunity.
Unlike many existing tools, such as surveys and polls, researchers cannot ask a question of the Twitter users directly; instead, researchers must determine whether the question is one that the Twitter data can answer.
This new kind of data presents new challenges, such as privacy, anonymity and legality, but developing a science around it has the potential to do enormous good.
