The attorneys will weed out jurors they believe are less sympathetic to their case on Tuesday, March 3.
If convicted, the jury then will decide whether he should be punished by life in prison without the possibility of release or death, most likely by lethal injection.
Many said they thought Tsarnaev was guilty of the April 15, 2013, bombings, which killed three people near the finish line.
He refused.
But this case is being tried in federal court, and 17 of the 30 counts against Tsarnaev include the death penalty as a possible punishment.
Tsarnaev, 21, is accused of building two homemade pressure cooker bombs with his older brother, Tamerlan.
No cameras are allowed at the Tsarnaev trial.
