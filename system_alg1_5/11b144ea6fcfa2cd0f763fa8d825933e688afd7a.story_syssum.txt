Her wrongful termination lawsuit contends Cherry killed off Edie Britt, the sassy, blond woman Sheridan played, in retaliation for her complaints about being hit.
Without it, her exit from the scene "wasn't funny anymore," Sheridan testified.
"It was shocking, humiliating, it was demeaning," she said.
Cherry apologized to her soon after the hitting incident, telling her "I am on bended knee begging for your forgiveness," Sheridan testified.
"He felt the incident had been resolved," Sheridan said he told her.
Britt is "a very colorful character, sassy, overt, audacious," Sheridan said.
The demise of Sheridan's character was first considered at the end of the third season, which ended with Britt's head in a hangman's noose, but a senior executive decided it was too soon for her to go, Levin said.
After five seasons, "writers could only do so much with the character," Levin said.
The human resources investigator never interviewed Cherry or Sheridan about the incident, only three people who worked for Cherry, Baute said.
Contracts introduced during Sheridan's testimony revealed that she is still getting royalties from the show, even for the last three seasons after her termination.
