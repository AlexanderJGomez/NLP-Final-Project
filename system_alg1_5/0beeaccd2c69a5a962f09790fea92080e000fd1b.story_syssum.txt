iReporter Clinton Wood, who lives outside Portland in Tualatin, Oregon, acknowledges that Seattle is prettier than Portland.
Absolutely not, Wood claims in his defense of Portland, and goes on to list why "Portland thumps Seattle."
"While I love Seattle, let's be clear, Portland is my city," writes Moon, who grew up in Portland.
For Portland-style brunch, Baker recommends Sanborn's, Genies Cafe, Zell's Cafe, The Country Cat and Cadillac Cafe.
And Ken's Artisan Pizza is the spot for great wood-fired pie, he says.
"If you visit Portland, Mount Tabor is a must-see," says Moon.
Seattle fans weren't as forthcoming about the Emerald City's strengths, but a few offered tips to give newcomers an overview of the city and its spectacular surroundings.
If you're planning to take in panoramic views from the city's Space Needle, which served as the symbol of the 1962 World's Fair, she recommends splurging on a meal at the landmark's revolving restaurant, SkyCity.
"The city is full of surprises and great shopping," says Crummett, and she recommends excursions to neighboring Bainbridge Island and Bremerton.
Seattle supporters, where are the rest of you?
