As far as the Johnstons know, their dossier was submitted to a Russian court on Friday, one month after meeting Anastasia in a children's home outside Moscow.
The couple already has one adopted child, 4-year-old Jack from Ethiopia, and two biological children.
"We knew that there was an overwhelming need for children to be adopted, especially children with special needs," Josh Johnston said.
They met with an official from the region's Ministry of Education, who gave them an information packet with Anastasia's picture, Josh Johnston said.
"She captured our hearts," he said.
Still, most adoptions are domestic.
"I was scared of the birth mother having a role in our lives, or taking the child back or changing her mind," she said.
He knows he is adopted and where he's from, she said.
It's part of his story, and we don't want to erase that," she said.
"Our son had been in that baby home for 12 months when we came along," she said.
We walked into that baby home and saw the number of children that need homes."
