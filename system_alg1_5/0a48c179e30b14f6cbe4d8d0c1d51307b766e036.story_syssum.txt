The many quirky, mystifying, baffling developments in Pyongyang make its young ruler, Kim Jung Un, an irresistible target for comedians.
According to the report, North Korea engages in murder, torture, slavery and mass starvation to terrorize the population into submission.
It is those random, capricious, frequently dangerous behaviors that allow fragile, brittle, bankrupt North Korea to force its dazzlingly successful neighbor, South Korea, to maintain a constant state of alert, to wonder if its capital city can survive an attack across a border that lies just 35 miles away.
It may also have launched a torpedo that same year which sank a South Korean navy ship, killing 46.
Ahead of the World Cup finals a satirical video purportedly showing a North Korean newscast declaring the North's team a finalist for the World Cup went viral, repeated as if it were true, as just another amusing moment from Pyongyang.
No official biography of the current Kim has been released, other than an account that says he was "born in heaven."
Racism, a myth of racial superiority, is a striking feature of the culture promoted by the regime.
By firing missiles, threatening neighbors and acting erratically, North Korea portrays itself as mysterious and volatile, and even that perception magnifies its ability to create fear, adding to its power and helping keep the despotic regime in control.
