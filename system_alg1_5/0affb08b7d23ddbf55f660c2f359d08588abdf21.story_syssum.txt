As his nation battles to win the third Test against England, and keep the five-match series alive, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has left the game's officials in no doubt as to his disgust.
His viewpoint was supported by one of Australia's greatest ever cricketers, Shane Warne, who took 708 Test wickets with his leg spin bowling during a glittering career.
"There was daylight between bat and ball, there was no hot spot and no noise," Warne said.
Umpiring decisions have caused much controversy in the previous two Tests matches, both won by England, who is looking to retain the Ashes for the third straight series.
John Howard, who served between 1996 and 2007, was a regular visitor to Test matches involving his country at home and abroad.
