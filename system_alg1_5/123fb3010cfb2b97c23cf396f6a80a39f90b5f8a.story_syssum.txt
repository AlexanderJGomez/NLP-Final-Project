"Because the ship had previously called at Stanley, it was denied entry to Ushuaia," said Julie Benson, a spokeswoman for Carnival Corp. She was referring to the port city in the Falkland Islands, which are referred to in Argentina as Las Malvinas.
"We are extremely disappointed about this alteration of the cruise itinerary, and are refunding the cost of shore excursions purchased by our passengers," she said in an e-mail.
The head of the province's port authority, Alejandro Berola, said that the decision to turn away the ships was made following "express instructions" from Gov.
The president of the tourism board of Usuaia, Marcelo Lieti, said Monday's incident "had nothing to do with the Malvinas subject," according to Telam.
"The policy that the government is carrying out, in reality, is distancing us from the Malvinas instead of getting us nearer," said Jorge Latana, a journalist who has proposed greater cultural integration with the islands' inhabitants.
Santiago Kovadloff, a philosopher, said the incident has nothing to do with sweeping away the British culture that is pervasive in the Falklands.
In that sense, the government is speaking out both sides of its mouth.
It's a policy that is half schizophrenic."
