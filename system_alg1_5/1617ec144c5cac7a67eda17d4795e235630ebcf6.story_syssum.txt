But as bidders make their pitches for his team, Donald Sterling -- Shelly's estranged husband and the team's other owner -- accused the NBA of violating his constitutional rights in trying to end his ownership of the franchise based on what he says was an illegally recorded conversation during a lovers' quarrel, according to a document provided by Donald Sterling's attorney.
"In reality, Mr. Sterling is being banned for life, fined $2.5 million, and stripped of his ownership rights for a purely private conversation with his lover that he did not know was being recorded and that he never intended to see the light of day," the document says.
His remarks were made in the heat of an argument, and while they were not justified, they were not meant to harm the NBA, the response says.
Donald Sterling's attorney, Maxwell Blecher, had no comment.
"I don't think it's a winning argument, but it is a very impressive document," Toobin said.
Johnson called the whole situation sad in his own interview with CNN, in which he urged Sterling to sell the team.
"Shelly and the NBA are working cooperatively on the transaction," O'Donnell said.
Shelly Sterling previously had said she wanted to own at least part of the franchise, but doesn't want to be a controlling partner.
His response, though, laments that a forced sale would mean the Sterlings would incur "several hundred million dollars" in taxes they could avoid if they were allowed to keep the franchise and leave the team to their heirs.
