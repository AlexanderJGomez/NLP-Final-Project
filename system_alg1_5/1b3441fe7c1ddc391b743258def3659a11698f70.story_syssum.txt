(CNN) -- Last fall, you could typically find my mom teaching, mentoring her students, nagging me to study for the SATs, taking my sister to soccer practice or cooking dinner.
The day after that Thanksgiving dinner, my mom was diagnosed for the second time with acute myelogenus leukemia (AML), a cancer of the blood -- after eight years in remission.
But South Asian donors of Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Nepalese, Bhutanese, Maldivian or Sri Lankan descent are some of the least-represented groups in the National Marrow Donor Program.
Once we learned that Mom needed a transplant, her former students, friends, and colleagues -- even those she did not know personally -- started setting up bone marrow drives around the country.
Once more, those who care about Mom stepped up to bring us hope.
More than 150 drives targeting South Asians were organized all over the world, held at colleges, temples, companies and festivals.
But two days later, we found out that donor, too, was unwilling to donate.
Of those, only 208,000, or nearly 2%, are South Asian.
Sadly, neither my sister nor I are matches.
If you are already a member, I salute you, but I challenge you to spread the word, so that my mom -- or someone else's mom, dad, sibling, child or friend -- can receive the gift of life.
