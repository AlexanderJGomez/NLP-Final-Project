Earlier Thursday, Kellogg Co. said it will not renew Phelps' advertising contract.
"Michael's most recent behavior is not consistent with the image of Kellogg," company spokeswoman Susanne Norwitz said.
On Thursday, before the decisions by USA Swimming and Kellogg were announced, Phelps told CNN affiliate WBAL that the incident was a result of "bad judgment."
"I'm 23 years old, and despite the successes I have had in the pool, I acted in a youthful and inappropriate way, not in a manner that people have come to expect from me," he said.
"For this, I am sorry.
In 2004, Phelps was arrested on charges of driving under the influence in Salisbury, Maryland.
