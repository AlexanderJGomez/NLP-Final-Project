It's a noble idea, given the horrible memories from Hurricane Katrina, which slammed into the Gulf Coast four years ago this week.
"The enormity of it, in order to do something effective, we'd have to do something at a scale that humans have never really done before," said Gabriel Vecchi, a research scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
"The problem is the storms come up so rapidly," said Gray, a professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University.
That's an economic problem," Gray said.
That's not likely, said Kerry Emanuel, a professor in atmospheric sciences at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
"You're doing something to the ocean that the hurricane would have done anyway," Emanuel said.
Gates and scientist Ken Caldeira, both listed as inventors on the patents, did not respond to CNN's requests to comment about their venture.
"At this point, there are no plans for deployment, so there is no talk of funding," she said, adding that it could take up to 18 months for the patent application to be approved.
"I would love to see Bill Gates, with all his money, use some of it to experiment."
