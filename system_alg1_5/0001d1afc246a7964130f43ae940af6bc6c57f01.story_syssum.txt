It's official: U.S. President Barack Obama wants lawmakers to weigh in on whether to use military force in Syria.
In a televised address from the White House Rose Garden earlier Saturday, the president said he would take his case to Congress, not because he has to -- but because he wants to.
"The aim of the game here, the mandate, is very clear -- and that is to ascertain whether chemical weapons were used -- and not by whom," U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters on Saturday.
The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which nine of the inspectors belong to, said Saturday that it could take up to three weeks to analyze the evidence they collected.
On Saturday, Obama proposed what he said would be a limited military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Syria's alleged use of chemical weapons earlier this month "is an assault on human dignity," the president said.
Meanwhile, as uncertainty loomed over how Congress would weigh in, U.S. military officials said they remained at the ready.
Some members of Congress applauded Obama's decision.
"I understand and support Barack Obama's position on Syria," Cameron said.
"The main reason Obama is turning to the Congress:  the military operation did not get enough support either in the world, among allies of the US or in the United States itself," Alexei Pushkov, chairman of the international-affairs committee of the Russian State Duma, said in a Twitter post.
"I think he has done well by doing what Cameron did in terms of taking the issue to Parliament," said Bashar Jaafari, Syria's ambassador to the United Nations.
On Saturday, Obama said "all told, well over 1,000 people were murdered."
