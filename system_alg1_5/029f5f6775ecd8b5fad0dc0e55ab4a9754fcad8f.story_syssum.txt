Obsidian -- a type of volcanic glass -- can produce cutting edges many times finer than even the best steel scalpels.
"The biggest advantage with obsidian is that it is the sharpest edge there is, it causes very little trauma to tissue, it heals faster and more importantly it heals with less scarring," he said.
Obsidian, meanwhile, cleaves into a fine and continuous edge when properly cut.
"The feel is very different because obsidian has no 'bite,'" he said.
"What's really fun is seeing it heal," he said.
"For studies where trace metals from ordinary scalpel blades cannot be tolerated, these very special obsidian scalpels may provide the answer," the company says.
"It's very fragile and it's very easy to break pieces off."
