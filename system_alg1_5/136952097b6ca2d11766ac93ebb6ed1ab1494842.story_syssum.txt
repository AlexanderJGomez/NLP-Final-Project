The device, he said, contained a SIM card and was designed to transmit private conversations occurring inside the embassy.
It was found two days before Patino was scheduled to arrive at the embassy, he said.

"Surely, there are risks, yes ... but we are willing to run them when it comes to defending rights," he said.
