On Sunday, the Yankees will play their last game before the stadium is torn down.
Jim Bouton was photographed as a rookie in 1962 at Yankee Stadium, before the renovation of the ballpark.
The Yankee clubhouse in 1962 was like a large subterranean living room.
And hanging in the lockers, with military precision, were the classic Yankee uniforms.
With no one around, I decided to try it on.
That looked good, too.
Fortunately, at that hour of the morning, it was just me and the pigeons.
But the umpire, bless him, called it a strike and Houk stepped back into the dugout.
After the game Houk said to me, "any more shutouts like that and we're going to need a new bullpen."
After that it was all down hill.
After 28 years, Yankee Stadium was a different place -- a strange and garish place.
Now, instead of restoring the stadium, they're going to tear it down.
If you check the current standings, you'll see this may already be happening.
