Clint Dempsey, who netted in the shock 2-0 win against European champions Spain in the semi-finals, put the U.S. ahead in the 10th minute.
But Bob Bradley's U.S. team, beaten 3-0 by Brazil in the group stage, took a shock lead when Dempsey found space in the penalty area to guide home Jonathan Spector's fierce right-wing cross for his third goal of the tournament.
However, the referee ruled otherwise to the Brazilian's disgust, which seemed to be justified by television replays.
It was Brazil's third Confederations Cup triumph, having also won in 1997, and represented a 14th victory in the last 15 meetings with the U.S.
Coach Dunga has now presided over seven wins in 20 days, with five at the Confederations Cup and two in World Cup qualifiers.
