The coal ash poured out of a broken pipe into the Dan River, turning water into dark muck.
"We're committed to the Dan River and the communities that it serves," Charlie Gates, the company's senior vice president of power generation operations, said in a statement Saturday.
Tests of the river last week revealed levels of copper, aluminum, iron and arsenic above state standards for surface water, state environmental officials said.
"It's certainly cause for concern for the long-term impacts of this coal ash spill on the health of the Dan River," he said.
Samples taken by the Waterkeeper Alliance last week contained "extremely high levels of arsenic, chromium, iron, lead and other toxic metals," the group said in a statement.
We're doing our objective analysis of what we're seeing so far, and I think we are concerned," he said.
"I stood on the bank a day or two after the spill, and I can say that I openly cried," she said.
Now, she said, cleanup is key.
We've been testing water quality since the leak occurred and will continue to do so," she said.
Even before last week's spill, coal ash contamination was a concern for North Carolina officials.
"Ash basin closure planning is already well under way for the ash basins located in North Carolina, including the one at Dan River," Parrish said.
According to figures released by Duke Energy, last week's spill appears to be similar to, but smaller than, a 2008 coal ash spill at a power plant in Kingston, Tennessee, which sent 1.1 billion gallons of sludge into the adjacent Emory River.
That amount of ash, the company said, would fill up to 32 Olympic-size swimming pools.
