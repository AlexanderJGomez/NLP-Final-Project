Herrera's rise to the top of the cutthroat world of fashion started in 1981, when she launched her flagship Carolina Herrera brand in New York.
Here, Herrera speaks exclusively to CNN about style, business, family and getting ahead in a man's world.
If you don't sell, then you are not in the business.
If I ask her to design clothes, she wouldn't know how to do (it).
Because then, you're successful.
It's a special touch.
Men, no.
Because women, we are able to do that.
You can be dressed by Carolina Herrera New York, but you can have the accessories from CH and it's like a lifestyle.
So, you have to change with the times.
It's so easy.
You know, there is a lot.
It shouldn't be treated that seriously because fashion is only making dresses to make women look beautiful.
I don't believe in this.
You have a lot of problems.
You have to be strong about it.
