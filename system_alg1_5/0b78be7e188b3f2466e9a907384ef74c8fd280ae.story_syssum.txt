"Contrary to the 'revelations' published by the German weekly Der Spiegel that were picked up by news outlets worldwide, I did not predict the result of the Cameroon vs. Croatia match played on June 18, 2014," said Perumal in a statement published online.
"At no time did I make reference to four goals being scored or to a red card being issued," Perumal said.
"I apologize to the Cameroon FA and to its fans if I inadvertently offended them; it was not my intention," said Perumal.
"I am now back in Hungary where I have testified against my former associates in a local match-fixing trial," said Perumal.
