For the past 26 years, musician Boujemaa Razgui, a Canadian citizen based in Boston, has traveled around the world and across the United States with his instruments, 11 neys and two kywalas, in tow.
Typically, passengers clear immigration and are subject to customs inspections based on what they declare to have brought into the United States, the Customs spokesperson said.
The spokesperson said agriculture specialists did not find or destroy any instruments, only fresh bamboo.
The Customs spokesperson, however, said agriculture specialists neither found nor destroyed any instruments.
In the past, he said, his instruments have been subject to increased scrutiny by Customs officials, but he has never had his instruments confiscated.
Razgui said he had to cancel a concert at a hotel in Holbrook, Massachusetts, on New Year's Eve.
"I need something to work with, it doesn't make sense to me that they were just cut off, I have a big heart for this," he said.
