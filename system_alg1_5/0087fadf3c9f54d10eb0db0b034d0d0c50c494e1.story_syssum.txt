Venice, Louisiana (CNN) -- A wind shift could push more oil from BP's Deepwater Horizon gusher into the Mississippi Delta and areas west of the river, which is "bad news for Louisiana," Gov.
Further east, scientists were analyzing tar balls found on a beach on Dauphin Island, Alabama, to determine whether they were caused by the oil spill, Coast Guard spokesman Erik Swanson said.
So far, the spill has had little impact on wildlife, said Mark J. Musaus, deputy director of the southeast region for the U.S.
Only a few birds have been taken to a wildlife rehabilitation center at Fort Jackson, Louisiana, he said.
The affected area, which is east of the Mississippi Delta, comprises about 4.5 percent of the Gulf of Mexico, NOAA said.
David Nagel, executive vice president of BP America, said the blowout preventer may be working better than some people believe, limiting the gusher to 5,000 barrels of oil a day.
"That started about a week ago," Suttles said.
It may take up to three months to reach the target area, Nagel said.
BP has built the smaller dome and it is already available, Suttles said Monday.
Called "Tophat," the 5-foot-tall, 4-foot-diameter structure weighs less than two tons.
That procedure would be done late next week, Suttles said Monday.
BP has received 3,400 claims for lost income and damages and 295 of those claims have been paid, at a price of $3.5 million, Nagel said.
