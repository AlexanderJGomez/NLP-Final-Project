Boston is home to Samuel Adams, the largest-selling craft beer company in the country, as well as some smaller, notable breweries like Trillium Brewing and Cambridge Brewing Co.
So, for better or worse, you're likely to start seeing much more from this craft beer forefather.
Its XXXXX Stout, much like the Super Bowl, has a fondness for Roman numerals.
Since 1993, Harpoon's hoppy pale ale has been a New England staple.
While Redhook makes its home in Woodinville, it also has a brew house in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, which is about an hour's drive from Boston.
One standout is Mass Rising, a double India pale lager that is hopped-up, crisp and drinkable.
Same goes for your beer.
Sky Hag is bitter, loaded with West Coast hops and may not be pretty, but it will get you where you want to go.
