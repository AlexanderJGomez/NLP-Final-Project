Finally, we disembark and begin to trek through the dense forests of Gombe for a further hour before the chimps in question are finally glimpsed.
"The magic of Gombe is two factors," said Emily Boehm, a PhD candidate at the Jane Goodall Institute Research Center, here to study the chimps.
The group Goodall studied has the most, with around 60 members.
According to senior researcher at the Jane Goodall Foundation, Dr Anthony Collins, activities like these display a high level of intelligence.
"In some places that they live, there are lions, leopards, pythons.
But on the whole, probably their main enemy is something like me, humans," Collins continued.
"In my opinion, chimps are important for the country's economic growth," said Aristides Aloice Kashula, a Gombe-Masito Program forest officer.
That's a sentiment that Jane Goodall herself would be sure to endorse.
