Mohammad Abu Khedair, 17, was heading from his home to a mosque in the middle-class neighborhood of Shuafat for prayers around 4 a.m. when three men forced him into a car and drove off, his father, Hussain Abu Khedair, told CNN.
He called the young Palestinian's killing "a forbidden action, and it has no forgiveness."
The killing riled many Palestinians, particularly in Jerusalem.
DNA, through saliva samples, was used to positively identify the boy, his father said.
Yet Hussain Abu Khedair, the boy's father, blamed Israelis and vehemently denied reports that this may have been tied to any sort of family dispute.
He noted that both Israeli and Palestinian officials have condemned it, and he added to Netanyahu's call.
As news of the boy's death spread, public anger in Palestinian neighborhoods of Jerusalem rose to levels rarely, if ever, seen since the Second Intifada, or uprising, last decade.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society reported that more than 100 were injured, most of them in Shuafat, in the clashes.
"We will not bury my son at night," he said.
Palestinian medical sources reported at least 10 injured, one of them seriously.
It warned that if Netanyahu "brings a war on Gaza, the gates of hell will open to him."
"A broad moral gulf separates us from our enemies," he said.
