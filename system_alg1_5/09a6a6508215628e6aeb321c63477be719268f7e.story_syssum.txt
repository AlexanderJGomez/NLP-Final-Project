Then screams.
There are prayers for 43-year-old Traci Johnson, who is in stable condition at a nearby hospital for treatment of "numerous wounds," according to police.
Lewis also said there may be other information about Nolen's past, that he could not reveal, that might help explain the incident, and that the FBI had been called in to dig deeper into Nolen's background.
But Friday, there was nothing normal about it.
"We have someone attacking someone in the building," he says.
"He wasn't targeting anyone, wasn't going specifically after them," the police spokesman said.
"And that, that's a gunshot."
Instead, he confronted and twice shot Nolen, who is now hospitalized in stable condition.
That said, it's not known if Nolen's religion had anything, at all, to do with what happened Thursday.
Mary Fallin, Alex Weintz, noted the governor had blocked Nolen from receiving parole in 2012, but said she "believes we need to let law enforcement do their job and not to jump to any conclusions before the conclusion of the investigation."
