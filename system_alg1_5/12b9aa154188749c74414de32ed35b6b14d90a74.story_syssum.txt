"By ignoring the will of the American people, President Obama has cemented his legacy of lawlessness and squandered what little credibility he had left," House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement after the speech.
"President Obama has once again put divisive and manipulative politics before the sober leadership and sound laws required of an exceptional nation," Bush said in a statement.
The President has said 22 times previously that he does not have the power to legislate on immigration," Paul said in a statement.
"The president's decision tonight will lead to more illegal immigration, not less," Texas Gov.
"We need immigration reform.

"We will challenge him in court."
Arizona Sen. John McCain said Obama's "executive fiat" hurts chances of working with a Republican-dominated Congress on an immigration reform bill.
