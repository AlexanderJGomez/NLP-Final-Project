The assessment could be significant because it suggests the university was warned about Sandusky, in no uncertain terms, as early as 1998, but did not stop the alleged abuse.
In addition to Chambers' evaluation, NBC News released a 1998 campus police report tied to the same sexual misconduct allegations against Sandusky.
Like Chambers, he spoke to the child in question about what transpired between him and Sandusky.
Amy Elizabeth McCall, an assistant general counsel, asserted in a letter to CNN then that Penn State is "a state-related institution" and not a "state school" like some in other states, and therefore does not have the same public records requirements as other public institutions.
I was wrong," Sandusky said, according to the grand jury report.
Howard Janet, attorney for Victim 6, released a statement soon after news of the report broke on Saturday, blasting Penn State for failing to take action.
CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.
