They got the gas cans, and Anthony put the gas in her car herself, he testified.
"I'm probably the one who put that on" the gas can, George Anthony said, adding that at the time, after Caylee was reported missing, he and his wife were "running on fumes.
He said that when his daughter returned the gas cans to him, there was no tape on them.
In addition to capital murder in Caylee's death, Casey Anthony, now 25, faces six other charges, including aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter of a child and providing false information to authorities.
She brought Caylee with her, he said, and the three slept in his bed, with Anthony in the middle.
She was "happy, smiling.
However, under cross-examination by Baez, those who saw Anthony and her daughter together testified that Caylee was well taken care of and that Anthony, at least to their knowledge, appeared to be a good mother.
As she hung up, Anthony remarked, "Oh, my God, I'm such a good liar," England said.
In the early days of the investigation, Anthony said the nanny, who she said was named Zenaida Gonzalez and nicknamed "Zanny," had kidnapped Caylee.
One friend of Anthony's, Matthew Crisp, testified that he met her for lunch on July 7 and asked about Caylee.
She returned it about an hour later, he said.
In his earlier testimony, George Anthony denied ever sexually abusing his daughter or that he found Caylee dead in his pool.
