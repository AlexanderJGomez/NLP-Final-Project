(CNN) -- "At the end of six seasons, six beautiful seasons, it's like high school -- time to graduate and go to college," Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino told CNN as he and his cast mates bid farewell to their MTV hit "Jersey Shore" at the New York Television Festival.
Unlike the graduates of "American Idol," "Project Runway," or even "The Hills," the self-proclaimed guidos of the "Jersey Shore" represent a region.
The final episode of "Jersey Shore" airs December 13, and with the end in sight, the cast are thinking about what to do when the party's over, spinoffs notwithstanding.
He's also written a comic book using his "Jersey Shore" persona as a superhero: "By day he is Mike, almost like Clark Kent, and by night, he is 'the Situation,' who has the power of persuasion with females and gets that power from a tanning bed."
"But I hear they pay you less now, so that's not going to work."
"My parents, they're just trying to get everything out of this moment, and they want to have a family business, so we started Team Snooki Music," she said.
"Be honest," she said.
Pauly D said -- they always have the inevitable reunion show to look forward to, because, as show creator SallyAnn Salsano said, we've never seen the real "Jersey Shore."
"What really happened in that house, no one knows," she said.
