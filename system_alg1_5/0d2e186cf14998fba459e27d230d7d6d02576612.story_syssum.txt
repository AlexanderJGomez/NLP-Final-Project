Mike Dawson, who is competing in the men's kayak class, will not just be trying to impress his father, who coaches him, or his brother and sister, who will be watching from the crowd.
As one of the gate judges, Kay Dawson has an important role, but her decisions will be scrutinized by other officials -- each gate judge also monitors the two gates on either side.
The International Canoe Federation, which selected her as the only judge from New Zealand for the Olympic event, agrees.
Despite the multitude of officials at the canoe slalom event, the role of individual judges is still significant, Kay Dawson has said.
"If I'm paddling well, the gate judges won't come into play at all," he said.
For Mike Dawson, the Games are full of new experiences.
