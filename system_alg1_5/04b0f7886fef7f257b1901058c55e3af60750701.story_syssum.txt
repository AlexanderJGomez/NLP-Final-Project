It's been a busy decade for McLaughlin and Kraus, both 38.
The two former nannies recently became mothers: McLaughlin's son, Theo, and Kraus's daughter, Sophie, are both 2 years old.
Kraus: We're definitely more efficient than we've ever been before, because we have to be.
We have to do the parts of the day that we love: dinner, bath time and bedtime.
It's butt in the chair, when you get the kids settled, and you just go.
Kraus: Definitely.
We understand what it is when the other has been up all night with their children, if someone has the flu or something.
Kraus: It's funny.
Specifically, we talked a lot about "The Nanny Diaries" in the last couple of years because when we were nannies, we couldn't really understand why so much derision and scorn was thrown the way of not just us, but our colleagues.
I love doing both.
I am so psyched when I get to pickup at 5:30.
And I am grateful to have both in my life.
McLaughlin: But when they do, they are quite enchanted with each other.
Kraus: This was Emma's brainchild.
McLaughlin: We reached out.
So we have been doing a lot of thinking outside of the box about how to do that.
