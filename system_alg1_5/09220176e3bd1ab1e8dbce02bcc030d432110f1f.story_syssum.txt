"French dressing is less spectacular than Ascot, it's less extroverted," Arc spokesman Julien Pescatore said.
It's about elegance, beauty and glamor."
Set on the picturesque Longchamp racecourse in Paris, "the Arc," as it is known, prides itself on being Europe's most prestigious -- and richest -- horse race.
The Arc's slogan: "Ce n'est pas une course, c'est un monument" -- "Not so much a race as a monument," points to the grand imagery surrounding this uniquely French event.
A ticket to Royal Ascot's grandstand, meanwhile, will cost you Â£75 ($121).
It may be known as "The Sport of Kings," but come Sunday the Arc may also be referred to as the "Sport of Bakers" if French Derby winner Saonois takes the crown.
Whatever the outcome, one thing is for sure, the French crowd will be celebrating in style.
