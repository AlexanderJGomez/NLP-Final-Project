Mother Teresa, pictured in 1997, lived and worked in Kolkata from 1931 until her death.
But more important, Berisha said, Mother Teresa should rest next to her mother and sister, who are buried in a cemetery in the Albanian capital, Tirana.
Then there is Macedonia, the nation where Mother Teresa was born and raised.
"Mother Teresa was a citizen of India," said Vishnu Prakash, spokesman for the country's external affairs ministry.
She was a devout Catholic who transcended religion, inspiring a nation of millions of poor people, mostly Hindus and Muslims.
Mother Teresa was born as Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu to ethnic Albanian parents in Skopje, Macedonia, on August 26, 1910.
She became a fixture on the streets of Kolkata, often picking up the sick and hungry, and giving them food, shelter and love.
