Tracey Wygal weighed 295 pounds before starting a "clean diet," keeping a food journal and exercising.
"It was my first year out of college, and that number, along with being diagnosed as morbidly obese, was very frightening," remembers Wygal.
As her weight crept up, Wygal grew more frustrated, and eventually she decided it was time to gain control of her life.
"I was amazed by how many calories I was eating," Wygal said.
I didn't give up, though," she said.
Wygal, who's 5 feet 10 inches tall, says the fear of gaining weight motivates her to stick to her diet and exercise regimen because she never wants to look like she did at 295 pounds.
"It won't happen overnight," Wygal advises.
