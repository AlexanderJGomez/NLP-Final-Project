Ronaldo, Messi, Messi, Messi, Messi, Ronaldo, Ronaldo.
I want to try to improve, to become better as each day goes by.
On the one hand, the improbable, mercurial talent of the shaggy haired, oddly stooped figure of Messi, confusing defenders as much as inspiring his teammates to a higher level.
The two couldn't be much more different, in style and, if you are to believe the majority of the media, likability.
Off the field, his reticence to engage the media -- a symptom, it is said, of his shyness -- has been interpreted as haughty and arrogant.
As it stands, he's talking about that honor in aspirational terms, as a goal; he's spent most of his career battling comparisons.
And along with his natural ability, he's long been an indefatigable, consummate professional who gives everything he has until the final whistle, and that's what has fueled his work- and goal-rate in 2014.
But while he had a largely anonymous World Cup, it would be difficult to deny that, year round, it has been Cristiano's year.
And, like the man or not, no one should begrudge him his time at the pinnacle.
