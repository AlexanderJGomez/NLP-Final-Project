The rocket attacks from Hamas militants in Gaza never ceased, Israeli officials said.
Hamas said no to the cease-fire, both in word and in deed," Regev said.
Israeli leaders had agreed to the cease-fire, but from the outset warned it would be short-lived if the attacks from Gaza didn't stop.
"Hamas have decided to continue, and will pay the price for that decision," Netanyahu said Tuesday.
When the plan was announced, there was a split reaction from Hamas.
These, he said, are elements the Palestinians would like to see in a comprehensive cease-fire agreement.
We are still talking to other sides," he told CNN.
By Tuesday, the death toll from a week of Israeli airstrikes on Gaza had reached 194, with at least 1,400 wounded, according to Palestinian health authorities.
"I urgently call on the Israeli Security Forces to put an end to attacks against, or endangering, civilians and civilian infrastructure which are contrary to international humanitarian law," said Pierre Krahenbuhl, commissioner general of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, or UNRWA.
"Clearly, at this stage not enough is being done in that regard," Krahenbuhl said.
We really don't have any other choice," he said.
"The Egyptian proposal for a cease-fire and negotiations provides an opportunity to end the violence and restore calm," Kerry said from Vienna, Austria.
Kerry strongly condemned the rocket launches by Hamas in the face of the cease-fire plan, and said he is prepared to fly to the Middle East as early as Wednesday, if needed.
"It's important that the United States demand a cease-fire," he said.
