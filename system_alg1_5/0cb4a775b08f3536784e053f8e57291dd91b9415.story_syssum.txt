by the Pew Research Center found that those who have a college degree believed that they make about $20,000 more per year than those who didn't attain a college degree.
"We find that for the typical person there's about a $550,000 advantage to going to college in lifetime earnings," said Paul Taylor, one of the study's authors.
Yet, for those who are college graduates, 86% said college was a good investment for them personally.
"You have a public that understands that college is important," Taylor said.
For those who did not receive a college degree, 30% said they had wanted to apply for a job, but had not because the job required a college degree.
