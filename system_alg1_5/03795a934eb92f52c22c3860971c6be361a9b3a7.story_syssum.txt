Alonso, 29, admitted he made a bad start in the year's third grand prix but maintained race strategy was not the reason behind Ferrari's low-scoring performance.
Alonso insisted Ferrari can improve and once again challenge Vettel's front-running Red Bull team, citing the McLaren and Mercedes teams as examples to follow.
"This cannot and must not be the team's level," the 63-year-old said.
Now, it's easy to say that we were not on the right one, but we are a team and we take our decisions together.
Formula now takes a three week break before the season's first race in Europe, the Turkish Grand Prix, on May 8.
