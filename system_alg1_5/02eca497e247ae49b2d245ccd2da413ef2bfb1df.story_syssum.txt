Kyle secretly texted Littlefield, sitting next to him in a pickup, to say Routh was "straight up nuts."
Kyle sounded "irritated," she has testified, then he never responded to a text asking if he was OK.
Prosecutors argued that Routh is a "troubled man" who struggles with a "personality disorder," not insanity.
Or sane.
"I heard Mr. Routh say, 'I shot them because they wouldn't talk to me.
I feel bad about it, but they wouldn't talk to me.
"That's how I felt that day," Routh said on the recording.
It was "strange" because he wasn't hungry, and he felt the two men were trying to "force feed" him, Routh said to Schmidle.
"At the time of this tragedy, Eddie Routh was insane," defense attorney Tim Moore said.
"Again, that's pretty much saying, 'Duel mother****er.'
" Routh said.
After deliberating less than three hours, a Texas jury found Routh guilty of capital murder in the case.
