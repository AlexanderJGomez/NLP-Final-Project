About 1 in 7, or 13.5 percent of adults who encountered intense dust clouds after the collapse of the World Trade Center on September 11 were later found to have asthma, compared with just 8.4 percent who had no dust cloud exposure, researchers in Atlanta and New York City reported on Tuesday.
The mental health effects, which can be debilitating and often chronic, "seem to be the largest health problem coming out of 9/11" says Lorna Thorpe, Ph.D., the deputy commissioner of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Division of Epidemiology and one of the coauthors of the study.
People in the vicinity of the collapse had "the potential to inhale huge amounts of particulate matter," observes Joan Reibman, M.D., an associate professor of medicine and environmental medicine at the New York University School of Medicine and the director of the school's Bellevue Asthma Center, who was not involved in the study.
People with asthma may experience repeated bouts of coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and tightness in the chest.
More than 71,000 rescue and recovery workers, lower Manhattan office workers, nearby residents, and passers-by enrolled in the registry.
Among rescue and recovery workers, for example, the asthma risk was highest for those who worked on the pile on September 11.
"It shows that people who had heavy dust exposure in the initial period, that this was a risk to developing asthma but not the only risk," says Reibman, who also serves as the director of New York City's World Trade Center Environmental Health Center, one of three centers dedicated to treating September 11-related conditions.
She encourages people to recognize their symptoms and seek a proper diagnosis and treatment.
