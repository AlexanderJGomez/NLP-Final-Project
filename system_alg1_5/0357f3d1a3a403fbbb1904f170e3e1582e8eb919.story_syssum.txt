In a tweet, "NBC Nightly News" described Pardo as "legendary," and cast members from "SNL's" long run chimed in with approval.
Seth Myers, who spent years on "SNL" before recently beginning his own late-night talk program, wrote, "RIP Don Pardo.
Indeed, he was the NBC staff announcer on November 22, 1963, when President John F. Kennedy was shot.
In 1984, Pardo got a chance to parody himself on "Weird Al" Yankovic's recording of "I Lost on Jeopardy," informing the floundering Yankovic that he was "a complete loser."
But that, said "SNL" creator Lorne Michaels, was the idea.
Pardo also appeared in the movie "Radio Days" and on an episode of "30 Rock," among other credits.
