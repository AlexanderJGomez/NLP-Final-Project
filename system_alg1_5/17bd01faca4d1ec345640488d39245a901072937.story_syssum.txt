At one point in the video from the dashcam, a female officer can be heard saying: "Hold up, everybody, hold up.
They did.
He was then removed.
According to his suit, Bufford suffered abrasions to his fingers, face, back, head, ears and neck.
The officer who shut off the dashcam video was referred to an internal affairs department, Calvert said.
When we saw that an officer had violated that policy, it was very disappointing," he said.
Attorney Joel Schwartz, who represents Bufford, is urging reform.
