Relief is in sight for the Midwest this weekend, however, as higher temperatures make their way eastward, according to CNN meteorologist Chad Meyers.
The South will also experience higher temperatures by the end of the weekend but that region, too, will shiver a while longer.
The East might not feel the warmth until Tuesday, Meyers said, and will continue to feel temperatures that are 10 to 20 degrees below average.
Saturday night is expected to be the coldest, with lows in the teens and below in some areas, the weather service said.
Vancouver, British Columbia, hosts the 2010 Games, which begin with the opening ceremony on February 12.
