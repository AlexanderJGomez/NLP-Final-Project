Her new book of photographs and essays, "The Oldest Living Things in the World," came out on Earth Day, April 22.
Before I got the idea for "The Oldest Living Things," I was searching for something I could really sink my teeth into.
Examples of this include the map lichens in Greenland that grow only 1 centimeter every 100 years, and the spruce tree on the cover of the book, which, despite its spindly appearance, has been growing clonally for 9,950 years.
It is stunning, and I'd love everyone to be able to see through that window back into deep time.
In no particular order some of my favorite people are: David Foster Wallace, Werner Herzog, David Lynch, Ernest Shackleton, the women of art and science that history overlooked or forgot, risk-takers, climate crusaders, makers of eye-opening art, boundary breakers, fighters of injustices, and anyone forging a connection where one didn't previously exist.
There is so much to see, know and do in the world, and I hope that we can all get out there -- in our own ways -- and do some good.
