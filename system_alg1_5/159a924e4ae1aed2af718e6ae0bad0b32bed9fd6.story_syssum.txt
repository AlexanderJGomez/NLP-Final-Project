"Many girls were abducted by the rampaging gunmen who stormed the school in a convoy of vehicles," said Emmanuel Sam, an education official in Chibok.
The gunmen then burned homes and businesses in the town in Borno state as they fled with the girls, witnesses said.
They left with us in a convoy into the bush," said the student, who declined to be named for security reasons.
Boko Haram, which translates as "western education is sin," is known to have carried out deadly attacks on other schools in the northeast.
