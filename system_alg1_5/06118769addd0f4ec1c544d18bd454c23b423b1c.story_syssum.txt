In a record-setting month, it won't be the worst storm that Boston has ever seen, but it will just compound the exasperation caused by three -- now four -- weather systems that have dumped piles of snow on the city.
Massachusetts Gov.
-- Light snow, relatively speaking: Compared with other storms, this won't be as big a snow event for Boston.
So are parts of eastern Maine, where gusts of 60 mph are possible and up to 26 inches of snow.
-- No mass transit Sunday: MBTA, better known to many as the T, won't run Sunday, when the worst of the weather will be hitting.
"Travel will become nearly impossible," the National Weather Service is saying.
Already, more than 350 flights have been canceled for Sunday.
So much so that Gov.
-- Widespread wind field: If you live in Asheville, North Carolina, you don't have to worry about a blizzard, but the winds will be fierce beginning Saturday evening.
-- Record month: With 42.3 inches of snow recorded this month, Boston has already had the snowiest February on record and with the first inch of Saturday's snow, this month will become the snowiest of any month in Boston history, at least since records have been kept since 1872.
