Gilchrist said he would retire from Tests at the end of the current match, and then hang up his gloves in one-day internationals after the upcoming tri-series with Sri Lanka and India.
Boucher, by comparison, played in 109 Tests.
He has scored 5,556 runs to date, at an average of 47.89, with a highest score of 204 not out and having made 17 centuries.
But Ponting, who has struggled for form so far in the series, ground out his 40th half-century in Tests and Clarke provided able support to take Australia through to the close of play with no further loss of wickets.
