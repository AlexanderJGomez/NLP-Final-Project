Chris Christie as the Republican presidential candidate for 2016, Jeb Bush has been hinting that he might jump into the fray.
The most important asset Jeb Bush offers is that he is a known commodity, someone who is greatly respected in Republican circles.
Bush can survive the pressure from the right in the primaries.
Most importantly, other than on immigration reform and education policy, Bush is a conservative and has a record to prove it.
Bush will be able to make a strong case in the primaries that he is as conservative as anyone else in the bunch.
This year will be no different.
During the recent midterm primaries, the Republican establishment showed that money matters.
"He's a uniter.
While Bush is a conservative, without question, his record on the issues of immigration and education along with his demeanor will probably be enough to make a pitch that he is a coalition builder .
Finally there is the question of Bush fatigue.
But, especially in the short-attention span politics of the U.S., 2008 is a long time ago.
If he puts his full heart into this race, and it still remains unclear thus far that he will, Hillary Clinton and other Republican contenders should be worried that the 2016 election could be another year for the Bush family.
