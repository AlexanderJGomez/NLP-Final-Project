Malala has encouraged girls and their families to resist the Pakistani Taliban, which pushed girls from classrooms, since she was 11.
The militants vowed that if Malala survived, they'd go after her again.
Initially, supporters in Pakistan gathered for small vigils to pray for Malala's recovery.
Malala later requested that schools not be named for her, to prevent them from becoming prominent targets for the Pakistani Taliban.
Brown, who heads up the "I am Malala" campaign in his role as United Nations special envoy on global education, toured Pakistan to boost education with international funding and local initiatives.
After her shooting, Brown visited schools, including hers.
"She is lucky to be alive," Dr. Dave Rosser, the medical director of University Hospitals in Birmingham, UK, told reporters after her arrival.

"What he did was intolerable," Rehana Haleem said.
After regaining strength, Malala is now set to endure more surgery.
She is all about education.
