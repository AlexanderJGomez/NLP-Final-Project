And even once it was clear that Obama could win, some CBC members were still skeptical.
She further indicated that the black caucus wanted to put pressure on Obama, but could not, due to the fact that black people "love the president."
She said the caucus also "loves the president," but lamented, "We are getting tired."
All seemed well, that is until Saturday night at the 41st annual CBC Phoenix Awards dinner in Washington, where the president told the attendees, "I expect all of you to march with me and press on.
We've got work to do, CBC."
Obama  responded, "America doesn't work that way."
Never.
So the deeper question is not why President Obama took the tone he did, but why black America tolerates it.
I too like this president.
The cold hard fact is that no group is being as negatively impacted by this recession as blacks, so it is proper and necessary for the CBC and others to continue to press this president to do more.
