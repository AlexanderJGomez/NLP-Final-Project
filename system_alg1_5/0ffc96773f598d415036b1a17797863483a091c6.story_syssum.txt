(CNN) -- Chuck Klosterman's seventh book and second novel, "The Visible Man" (Scribner), is out Tuesday.
Chuck Klosterman: I think it was probably when I was writing the previous book, the essay collection (2009's "Eating the Dinosaur").
He was just this kind of egocentric, weird person.
At the same time, I was thinking a lot about the process of interviewing.
Klosterman: No.
But here's the trick, or, I guess, the paradox: Even though interviewing is this incredibly flawed process, it's still the best means we have for understanding people we don't know.
I understand that, and I think that's why a lot of pretty smart writers, as they age, do tend to do less reporting.
CNN: One of the two main characters in the book, and the one who tells the book's story, Victoria, admits on Page 1, "I am not a writer."
There are two primary characters, obviously, and the one character, because he's this psychopathic scientist, he is this kind of unlikable, egocentric person.
I can't imagine someone reading this and going, "I really relate to this man or this woman."
In probably all of my books, except maybe the very first one, but even that one probably, is this idea of, "What is reality?"
Klosterman: Both.
But at the same time, if you keep going on that, eventually you end up writing a book where the whole premise is, "This book exists."
Klosterman: Well, it's a very good question, I guess, would it bother me.
I think that, in general, when I write nonfiction, I want it to seem like hyperreality, for it to feel like you're reading fiction.
