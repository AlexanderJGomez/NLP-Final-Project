In their talks, visiting Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh reviewed cooperation in military, technical, energy, high-technology and telecommunications.
At present, two nuclear power plants are being built in southern India with Russian assistance.
Talks, Singh noted, were on for the construction of additional Russian-designed reactors.
It is a partnership that has and will continue to develop independent of our relations with other countries," Singh remarked.
Medvedev's trip to New Delhi follows similar trade-promoting visits by U.S. President Barack Obama, France's Nicolas Sarkozy and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao.
