Then, this week, TMZ Sports released footage of surveillance video from inside the elevator that shows the altercation and the knock-out punch.
It shows Rice and Palmer inside the elevator, where he punches her, and she lunges at the football player.
"We requested from law enforcement any and all information about the incident, including any video that may exist," NFL Vice President of Corporate Communications Brian McCarthy, said, specifically citing New Jersey State Police, Atlantic City police and Atlantic County prosecutor's office as places where the NFL inquired.
Revel Entertainment Group, which owns the casino where the incident happened, said it gave copies of the video to Atlantic City police, the prosecutor's office, the Division of Gaming Enforcement and Rice's attorney.
The next day, he and Palmer were married.
"There's really no appeal that's available at this point," CNN Legal Analyst Paul Callan said.
It is rare to offer pretrial intervention in domestic violence cases, Callan said, but in Atlantic City -- with an elevated homicide rate -- this incident probably was not as big a priority.
When the grand jury decided to indict Rice on the more serious felony charge, Rice's attorney, Michael Diamondstein, had this to say as he entered a not-guilty plea: "I can't try the case in the media.
"No party committed any crime," Palmer's lawyer, Robert Gamburg, told CNN at the time.
Janay Rice on Tuesday expressed outrage, too.
What don't you all get," Janay Rice wrote.
CNN's Shimon Prokupecz, Jill Martin, Miguel Marquez, Ashley Fantz and jennifer Bernstein contributed to this report.
