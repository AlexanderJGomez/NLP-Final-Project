Can we please stop saying, "Happy New Year?"
Seamon-Primas told me: "In my opinion, after the first week, I stop wishing others a Happy New Year, the new year is well on its way."
The biggest reason we need to stop New Year's wishes weeks into the year is that it sounds so insincere.
If you really care about how my year is going, ask me in October.

Sure, I get it: It's a wish for a full year, not just a day.
If even one custom instructed us that extended New Year's wishes would increase the chances the year would indeed be a good one, I'd be saying Happy New Year's every day until April.
However, even if you are reading this after January 7, I still sincerely wish you, and your family, a very happy and healthy New Year.
