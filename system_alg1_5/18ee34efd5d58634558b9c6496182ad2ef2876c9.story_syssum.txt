Nearly 20% of obese people whose doctors hadn't brought up their weight described themselves as "not overweight," compared with just 3% of those whose doctors had addressed their weight.
"If people are told by their doctor that they are overweight, it corrects their perception," says the lead author of the study, Robert Post, M.D., research director of the Virtua Family Medicine Residency in Voorhees, New Jersey.
And many doctors have negative attitudes toward their heavier patients, whom they see as unlikely to stick to a diet and exercise program, he adds.
Roughly two-thirds of U.S. adults are now overweight or obese, and as Americans have grown heavier, the perception of what constitutes a normal weight has changed as well, Post says.
"This is very, very easy to do," Baron says.
"If it were required or strongly suggested, it would not be very onerous.... We need to be as aggressive as we were with smoking cessation."
