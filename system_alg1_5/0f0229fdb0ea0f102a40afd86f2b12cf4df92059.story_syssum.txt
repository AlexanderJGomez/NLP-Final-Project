The finals on Tuesday afternoon pitted Dynda Morgan, 14, of Savannah, Georgia, against Moore.
In the tiebreaker, the two girls furiously raced to thumb the final text: "Zippity Dooo Dahh Zippity Ayy...MY oh MY, what a wonderful day!
But then Moore's phone began to vibrate, signaling that she was the grand champion.
Moments after her victory, Moore agreed to an exclusive text message interview with CNN.
