And "never mind," is what Speaker Boehner might just as well have said Thursday when he all but declared the immigration reform legislative debate dead for 2014.
Of course not, and it was just a week ago that the same Speaker Boehner said this of the same immigration debate:
But to that point, again just a week ago, the word from House GOP leadership aides was that Boehner wanted to try to see if the House could act this year.
They insist people, primarily immigration activists and the media, read too much into what the Speaker said a week ago.
"Nothing the House would do would ever become law," Castellanos said -- meaning that even if the House passed something, it was unlikely that differences with the Senate could be worked out this year.
"Right now, the spotlight is center stage on the Democrats, the President and Obamacare," said Castellanos.
"And the GOP wants to do nothing to distract from that, certainly not start a food fight on immigration."
