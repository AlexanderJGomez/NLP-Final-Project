On the motorcycling track, 2013's calendar is a parade of Iberian supremacy, with Spaniards dominating every race class to the almost complete exclusion of other nations.
"It just happens as a 20-year-old," said Toseland, who returned to Superbikes before a wrist injury ended his racing career in 2011.
"I remember one of his last races in the old 125 class, in Portugal," he said.
"He's somebody who arrived to the championship as a hero, kind of saying, 'I'm here, I want to be here.'
"He brings so much energy, such a fresh way of behaving, a fresh mind, enthusiasm," Poncharal told CNN.
"On the riding he can compete with Marquez and he's showing that every weekend, but Marc is so much more appreciated by everyone because of his nature, and Marc instantly makes you feel at home with him; he inspires sympathy, and not everybody has got that.
"Rossi, (Casey) Stoner, Lorenzo, Pedrosa and other riders have put the championship at an incredible level, and I think one of the assets of Marc is that he has been beating people like Lorenzo and Pedrosa, who are really great, great riders.
"To join one of the best teams, with what looks like the best bike this year -- and with Lorenzo and Pedrosa both injuring themselves and missing a race early in the year -- for him to then get the confidence of actually learning how to win, and getting a couple of wins under his belt, all those factors put into the pot have just made him so confident in what he's doing," he said.
"At the moment he has the lot, he's on what feels like the best bike, which is for sure a bonus, although Lorenzo is showing us that the Yamaha is not so bad," he said.
"It's always difficult to say, 'He's going to be the greatest of all time,' " Poncharal said.
