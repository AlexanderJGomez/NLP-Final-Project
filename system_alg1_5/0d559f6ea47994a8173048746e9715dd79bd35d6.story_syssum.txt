But on 10 minutes the referee took the decision that essentially ended the game as a contest.
Substitute goalkeeper Gianluca Pegolo's first task was to pick the ball out of his net.
But 18 minutes from time he rose unmarked in the box to head home a David Beckham corner.
And, on the hour mark, Vucinic turned provider again for Toni to head home his second.
