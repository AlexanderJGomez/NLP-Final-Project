Every girl should have the right to that life, but there are millions of girls in my country who are not so fortunate and are subjected to child marriage.
According to the UN, any person under the age of 18 is a child.
Now those girls have their own children.
There are many reasons why early marriage is so prevalent in Bangladesh, but one of the biggest reasons is lack of quality education.
They have no idea about the likely consequences of child marriage, and so it's a cycle that continues.
If we stop this problem, other problems in our country will be reduced automatically.
Those girls are still in school.
I am a blessing, and I have dreams that I will and can achieve.
