PC sales representatives at Bainaohui, one of Beijing's largest electronics retailers, say their merchandise is not pre-installed with Green Dam, a Web filtering software the government said was necessary to prevent children from viewing pornography and other harmful content.
"China is putting companies in an untenable position by requiring them, with virtually no public notice, to pre-install software that appears to have broad-based censorship implications and network security issues," said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke in a press-release.
Domestically, Chinese Internet users are rallying against the government.
The Chinese artist, activist, and architect who designed the Olympic "Bird's Nest" stadium, is one of the leaders behind the cyber battle.
"It says, 'We're behind the mask; if one of us falls down, ten others will join.'"
"However," he said in a regular press conference last week, "no matter how many different views there are, the Chinese government assumes the responsibility to protect our youth from unhealthy information on the Internet, and so do various social circles and enterprises.
Said Victor Gao, a former government functionary who now heads a policy think tank: "The government always has its own views, but whether they are able to execute it to the detail and push it through the country is another issue."
"I have no idea since I have not used it yet," said a seller of computer software.
"I don't think there would be any impact," replied another.
