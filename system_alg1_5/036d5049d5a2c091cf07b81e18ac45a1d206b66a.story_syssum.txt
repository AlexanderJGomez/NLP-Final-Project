A few days later, Clinton called for a temporary extension of President George W. Bush's tax cuts, including those for the wealthy, and then on Thursday said he was sorry for doing so.
But at another level, the debate between these two men is part of a bigger debate about what kind of campaign the Democrats should run: a campaign of articulation or a campaign of triangulation.
One strategy, which has been the preference thus far for President Obama, is a campaign of "articulation," a campaign in which a candidate lays out a clear set of themes and ideas to distinguish himself from the opposition.
The other kind of campaign, the campaign of "triangulation," is one that Bill Clinton mastered in 1996.
In 1996, Clinton perfected this kind of campaign.
In essence, he stole the mainstream part of the Republican agenda and made it his own.
They are the organizers, the mobilizers and the rank-and-file who can make sure that in a close election, more Democrats come out to vote.
If he does not, and he takes the triangulation bait, Obama could end up becoming a surrogate for the Romney campaign.
