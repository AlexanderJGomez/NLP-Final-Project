Not bad, actually.
Forgacs is co-founder and CEO of Modern Meadow, a young company that is developing lab-engineered meat and leather products, known as cultured meat.
"Once you start to see food as technology, as a form of hardware, you start to ask, why can't food get better?"
To an eating public increasingly focused on organic, farm-to-table food, cultured meat -- also known as "in vitro" or "test-tube" meat -- sounds unnatural and unappealing.
"It's the future," said entrepreneur Biz Stone, a vegan and co-founder of Twitter and Jelly.
Using a formula developed at the University of Missouri, Beyond Meat takes plant protein from soy and peas and applies heating, cooling and pressure to realign it so that its structure resembles meat tissue.
But the most fascinating, and polarizing, startup in this emerging space is Modern Meadow.
"We basically have a team of scientists who developed this," said Andras Forgacs, adding that each chip can be made for less than $100.
The project, funded by Google co-founder Sergey Brin, cost some $325,000.
But they are coming, entrepreneurs say.
We've been eating meat for 2 million years," said Ethan Brown, CEO of Beyond Meat.
But, he added, "You can see the change coming when you sit down and talk to a child.
Stephens, the University of Cardiff researcher, believes the idea of cultured meat is still too new for most people to wrap their heads around.
