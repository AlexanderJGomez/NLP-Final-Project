The woman had on a gown, gloves, mask and a shield during her multiple visits with Thomas Eric Duncan, but there was a breach in protocol, health officials said.
Duncan, the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, died Wednesday.
Also, Varga said that someone who is a "close contact" of the nurse has been "proactively" placed in isolation.
"This development is understandably disturbing news for the patient, the patient's family and colleagues and the greater Dallas community," the CDC said in a statement, announcing the nurse's test results.
"We knew a second case could be a reality, and we've been preparing for this possibility,"  Dr. David Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services, said in a statement Sunday morning.
"I think we've always expected that there may be another individual who will come down with the Ebola from the transmission of this one particular person, and we always felt that it was going to likely be one of his close contacts or one of the health care workers, because that's the way this virus works," Dr. Frank Esper said.
Of those, more than 4,000 have died.
In Liberia, health care workers are threatening to strike if their work conditions don't improve.
For weeks, health officials have been monitoring those who had contact with Duncan before he was hospitalized and isolated.
"We need a whole new crew of people to do contact tracing," said Elizabeth Cohen, CNN senior medical correspondent.
"This is not an easy thing," Cohen said.
