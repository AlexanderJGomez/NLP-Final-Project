(CNN) -- A Florida jury awarded a 92-year-old man $1.9 million in compensatory damages for the death of his wife, a former two-pack-a-day Marlboro smoker who started when she was 16 and died in her 70s, attorneys said Thursday.
The Florida Supreme Court also allowed some factual findings about smoking causing disease be taken from Engle case and applied to the progeny cases "so plaintiff's attorneys don't have to start from square one in each of these cases," said Ed Sweda, a lawyer for the Tobacco Products Liability Project in Boston, Massachusetts.
So far, six of the eight Engle cases that have gone to trial have come back with a plaintiff's verdict, said Sweda.
"We're more than happy to keep trying them," he said.
