Introduced on Wednesday, the Kindle Touch will be the first Amazon e-reader with a touch screen.
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has defended the lack of a touch screen on previous Kindle models, saying conventional touch displays produce reflections.
For that reason, the Kindle Touch relies on infrared sensors, which are stationed along the edges around the screen to detect when the user's finger touches a particular spot on the device's face, an Amazon spokeswoman said.
Despite its success with the market-leading Kindle, Amazon isn't the first to apply these invisible lasers, commonly used in TV remotes, to reading devices.
Another, Kindle Keyboard, costs $99 to $139 and looks just like its predecessor, the Kindle 3.
Amazon may have accounted for that by including a bigger battery on the Touch because that model lasts for two months, which is double the battery life of the smaller Kindle, according to Amazon's specification page.
