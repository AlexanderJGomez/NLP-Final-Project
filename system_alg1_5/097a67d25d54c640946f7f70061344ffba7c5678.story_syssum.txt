It is September 2003, and I just found out my daughter is going to be born with Down Syndrome.
I am scared, naturally.
It doesn't.
So I make up my mind that just because she has Down Syndrome, I don't have to give up all of my dreams for her.
These days, Jaylin is doing well.
Had she not been born with Down Syndrome I don't think I would be as good a person as I am now.
Jaylin is such a special child.
She will keep doing what she loves, in great shoes, just to make me happy.
