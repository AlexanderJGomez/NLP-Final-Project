The designation addresses the spread of the flu, not its severity.
Typically, the flu season begins in the winter months and peaks in January or February, according to the CDC.
"As typical of a flu season, some areas are being harder hit than other areas," said CDC spokesman Tom Skinner.
H1N1 is the same virus that caused a pandemic in 2009, Dr. Michael Jhung, a medical officer in the CDC's flu division, has said.
Since then, "it's established itself very nicely in the human population," Jhung said.
"People who are young and healthy should be aware that they may get the flu and it could be serious," Rehm said.
That excuse doesn't hold up, she said.
