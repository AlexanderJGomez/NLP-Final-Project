New York (CNN) -- America's job crisis is a result of decades of shopping on credit and underinvesting in research to fuel new industries, says analyst Fareed Zakaria.
From the 1950s, America had a very stable pattern of consumption.
This is completely unsustainable.
That is in a sense, investing in the middle class, because that is investing in the industries of the future, the industries that will create middle-class jobs.
I would argue that we actually need to do a lot more than we did in the 1950s, because in the 1950s there were millions of jobs for semiskilled labor, manufacturing jobs, making steel, making cars.
Zakaria: That's what's produced the semiconductor industry, it was government investment.
There's another urgency.
No.
Every industrialized country in the world has it.
We are the only ones who don't.
Zakaria: Perhaps the most intelligent investment we can make is in human capital, particularly in talented people in science, math and computers.
No, no, no, go back to your country.
We don't reap any benefits from it.
And I think that's a wonderful idea.
On the contrary, we're trying to throw more people out.
Zakaria: No.
This is math, this is not politics.
Zakaria: The countries that have been able to maintain a manufacturing base, such as Germany, are really worth studying.
We don't have any such systems in America.
