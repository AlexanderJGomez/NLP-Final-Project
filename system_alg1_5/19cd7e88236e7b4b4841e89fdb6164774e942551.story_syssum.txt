CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- With the retirement of Justice David Souter, President Obama has the opportunity to bring a special kind of diversity to the Supreme Court: the diversity of broad and varied governmental experience.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
For the first time in American history, not a single justice has had any legislative experience.
Traditionally, the Supreme Court has been composed not only of former judges, but also lawyers who have come directly from serving as senators, governors, Cabinet members, heads of administrative agencies, and even from private practice.
This, of course, is an illusion.
For example, take a look at the Supreme Court's 2006 term.
In every single case, Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts held for the prosecution.
In every single case, Justices John Paul Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer held for the defense.
We should welcome, and not irrationally restrict, the variety of experience that can be brought to Supreme Court decision-making.
