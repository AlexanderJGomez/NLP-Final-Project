"There is going to be one," Reubens said.
Reubens gamely responded, before shaking his head no and adding: "It's called P.T."
After missing the final cut for the 1980 cast of "Saturday Night Live," Reubens adapted the eccentric character for the stage with "The Pee-wee Herman Show," which gained national exposure after being filmed and released by HBO as a 1981 special.
The success of that bizarre comedy helped Reubens launch a TV series, the eventual cult-classic "Pee-wee's Playhouse," in 1986.
In 2007, the actor appeared in character at Spike TV's Guy's Choice Awards, marking Pee-wee's first public appearance since 1992; then in 2011, Reubens appeared as Pee-wee in a "Saturday Night Live" segment opposite cast member Andy Samberg.
