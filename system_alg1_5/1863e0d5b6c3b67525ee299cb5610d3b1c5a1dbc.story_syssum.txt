He seemed very, very cordial.
There were only about sixty people in the club, it's a very small room, so Sir Paul gave everyone at the Les Paul performance a very special experience.
I had met him once before after a concert, very, very briefly, but this was something special.
We love making music and that was inspired by Sir Paul.
