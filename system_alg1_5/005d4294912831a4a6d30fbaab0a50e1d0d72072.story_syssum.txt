Because of that rarity and its elusiveness, the saola is dubbed the "Asian unicorn."
Saola are the holy grail for Southeast Asian conservationists," Van said in a press release.
There are no saola in captivity.
"Saola are caught in wire snares set by hunters to catch other animals, such as deer and civets, which are largely destined for the lucrative illegal wildlife trade," Van said in the WWF release.
