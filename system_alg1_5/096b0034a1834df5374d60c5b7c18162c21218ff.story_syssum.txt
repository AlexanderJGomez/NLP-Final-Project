"My son tried to run thinking his life was in jeopardy," Terez Miles said.
After that, she said, the police used a stun gun and beat him, pulling out a chunk of his hair.
A hearing in the case was scheduled for Thursday, but it was unclear whether the officers involved showed up, said Miles' attorney, Kerry Lewis.
"The case is being investigated, he's closely monitoring it.
There's no need for this degree of violence and brutality for someone of this stature," she said.
