Despite having never personally met Assange, Ken Loach, the veteran British director of movies including "Kes" and "Sweet Sixteen," said he had offered Â£20,000 ($31,444) towards his bail.
"I think the work he has done has been a public service," he told reporters, in quotes carried by Britain's Guardian newspaper.
He hasn't even been charged, let alone convicted."
Meanwhile, Vaughan Smith, the founder of London's Frontline Club which claims to "champion independent journalism," offered to accommodate Assange, who has no British address, at his sprawling family home in order to meet another of the bail conditions issued by the court Tuesday.
"He is in solitary confinement.
Tatchell, meanwhile, also appeared outside the court on Tuesday to express his support for the work of WikiLeaks.
But he is innocent until proven guilty."
Ellsberg, a former military analyst, famously leaked the "Pentagon Papers" in 1971, a classified study into U.S. decision-making during the conflict.
"If the police have any accusations they should let him answer for them," she said, adding that he should be treated fairly.
