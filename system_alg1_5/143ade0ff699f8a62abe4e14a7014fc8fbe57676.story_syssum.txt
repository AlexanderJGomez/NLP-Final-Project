That may seem like a strange thing to be excited about, or even to know about, but hear me out on this: Since September, I've been writing about Hawaii's lowest-of-the-low voter turnout rate for a new CNN project called Change the List.
Hawaii's turnout dropped 4.6%, by comparison.
And, in some respects, it is.
My favorite: A single message from a Facebook fan of CNN iReport persuaded Michael Remen, a sous-chef in Hilo, Hawaii, to vote.
CNN, of course, can't take credit for the people who woke up in Hawaii, way out in the middle of the Pacific, on November 6 and decided to vote.
And they're people like Joe Heaukulani, who goes door to door on Oahu trying to persuade people to vote -- for any candidate, regardless of political party.
"Even if you convince one person," he said, "that means you did make a difference."
"Really, all of it has a measure of uncertainty."
