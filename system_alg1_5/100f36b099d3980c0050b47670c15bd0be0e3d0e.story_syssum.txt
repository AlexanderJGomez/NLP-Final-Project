(CNN) -- "Skyfall," the 23rd installment in the James Bond series, one of the longest-running film franchises in history, recently landed at the top of the box office with $87.8 million in ticket sales.
Shaking disbelief: One of the standout moments in "Skyfall" is the film's opening sequence in which Bond, played for the third time by Daniel Craig, and field operative Eve, played by Naomie Harris, chase a man through the streets of Istanbul.
It's information that "Skyfall's" bad guy Silva, played by Javier Bardem, plans on uploading to YouTube, putting the agents' lives at risk.
It's true that after bin Laden's compound was raided, stashes of flash drives, CDs and tapes were discovered.
Still, it's unlikely that he would be able to have all of this information in one place.
Stirring reality: Wright said many critical infrastructures are connected to Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems, controlling our electricity grid, water, and sewers, and are therefore are a huge soft target for terrorism.
Airlines could also be at risk, the expert said.
Still, just like M's office, Wright said the idea that Silva could target a train so quickly and send it to Bond's location is based predominately in fantasy.
"There's actually a term for this in the computer world called 'Honeypots'," he said.
"People tend to get comfortable using their own techniques, and they use the same approach over and over again," Wright explained.
"You can get a profile of an attacker, determine if it was the same group doing something else, and see what methodology they're using."
