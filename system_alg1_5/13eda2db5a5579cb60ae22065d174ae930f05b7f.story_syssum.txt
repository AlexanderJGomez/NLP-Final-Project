"Frank Samuelson, by name, is a racist," said Joseph Clark, who said he is taking his son out of the program in the upscale area in Gwinnett County.
Attorney Chris McClurg, who said he also has been Samuelson's friend for about five years, said the coach made a public apology and "is a nice guy" who made "insensitive" remarks.
The coach described south Asians as "Red Dots" and Hispanics as "Beaners," according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which said he mocked other ethnic groups and women.
I'm just saying.
"He wants to move on," said McClurg, indicating Samuelson was not available for comment Wednesday.
"Frank is loved by all those kids," the attorney said.
A message left with the Brookwood board president was not immediately returned Wednesday.
