PetMatch lets you upload a picture of a dog or cat, or use one from its gallery.
Of course, it's not perfect.
And, of course, we love our animals for reasons other than their appearance.
The PetMatch app, released this month, is currently available only on Apple's iOS operating system.
Now, it's planning to expand its item-specific offerings, with jewelry and furniture apps in the works.
