"I can only rejoice about the decision of inclusion of women's boxing," IOC President Jacques Rogge told reporters.
"The sport of women's boxing has progressed a lot, a tremendous amount, in the last five years and it was about time to include them in the Games."
As a result, he said, the IOC considered women's boxing to be more popular.
The International Rugby Board has proposed men's and women's Sevens tournaments, with 12 teams in each being divided into two pools before semifinals and finals.
