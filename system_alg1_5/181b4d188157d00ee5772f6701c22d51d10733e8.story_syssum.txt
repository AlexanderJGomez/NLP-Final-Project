Moluk, the matriarch of her family, is just one of tens of thousands of Iranian Jews who immigrated to Israel during the course of the last 60 years.
Jews, she explains, can practice their faith freely in Iran and are not persecuted.
There are between 100,000 and 200,000 Iranian Jews and their descendants in Israel, and despite the hostile relations between Israel and Iran, they're still able to closely follow events in their country of origin through internet radio stations like Radis In which broadcasts from Tel Aviv.
Barouch Davidi, one of the station's presenters, says that after hearing stories from other callers, he believes the economic sanctions are really beginning to hurt the Iranian regime.
A strike by Israel, he continues, should be only as a last resort.
"I don't believe it," she says.
Iranian Jews like Moluk and Mansour may be hoping for the best but preparing for the worst as politicians negotiate the future in the corridors of power, far away from this bustling Tel Aviv neighborhood.
