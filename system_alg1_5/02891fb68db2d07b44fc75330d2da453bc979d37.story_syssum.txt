Edwards, 83, had pursued a pardon from President George W. Bush, but never got one.
At Edwards' trial in 2000, star witness Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., former owner of the San Francisco 49ers, got a reduced sentence in exchange for testifying about his own $400,000 bribe to Edwards.
Edwards served several terms in office -- from 1972 to 1980, 1984 to 1988 and 1992 to 1996.
"Also convicted were Edwin's son, Stephen Edwards and his close associates Andrew Martin, Cecil Brown, and Bobby Johnson," the office says.
