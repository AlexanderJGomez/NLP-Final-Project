Found guilty of hooliganism, Tolokonnikova, 23, was sentenced to two years in the penal colony.
Four days later, she ended the hunger strike, said Pyotr Verzilov, her husband.
But Tolokonnikova will resume her protest if conditions at the prison camp don't improve, he said.
"It's like torture," she said.
Tolokonnikova is waiting to discover if she has done the same.
