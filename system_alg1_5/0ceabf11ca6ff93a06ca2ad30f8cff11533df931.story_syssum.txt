Student Andrew Meyer is surrounded by university police in Gainesville, Florida, on Monday.
"That's fundamental to a university campus.
"You will take my question because I have been listening to your crap for two hours," Meyer told Kerry, according to the police report of the incident.
Organizers had cut off questioning before Meyer went to the microphone, she said.
As he tried to escape their grip, Kerry protested, "That's all right, let me answer his question."
Don't Tase me, bro, I didn't do anything."
You were just trying to do your job," Meyer said, according to the police report.
"For a question to be met with arrest, not to mention physical violence, is completely unacceptable in the United States," Dictor said.
Meyer was carrying a business card advertising "TheAndrewMeyer.com 'Speak My Mind,' " the police report said.
"In 37 years of public appearances, through wars, protests and highly emotional events, I have never had a dialogue end this way," he said.
