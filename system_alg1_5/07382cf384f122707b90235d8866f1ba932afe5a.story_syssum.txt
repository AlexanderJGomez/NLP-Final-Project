In several public statements, with one as recent as Monday, Sony has said the persistent downtime was due to an "external intrusion," but has not provided a target date for when services will return.
"Unfortunately, I don't have an update or timeframe to share at this point in time," PlayStation spokesman Patrick Seybold said in a statement on Monday.
Sony released a statement on Thursday saying, "It may be a full day or two before we're able to get the service completely back up and running."
Gamers are livid.
All these launched in the United States on Tuesday, one day before the outage.
