The Earned Sick Time Act, which now goes to Mayor Michael Bloomberg, will require private businesses with 20 or more employees, to provide five paid sick days annually, beginning in April 2014.
The bill now goes to Bloomberg, who vowed Wednesday to veto it.
In 2006, San Francisco became the first city to required companies to provide paid sick days, according to the National Partnership for Women and Families.
Seattle passed laws in 2011, and Portland, Oregon, followed earlier in 2013.
