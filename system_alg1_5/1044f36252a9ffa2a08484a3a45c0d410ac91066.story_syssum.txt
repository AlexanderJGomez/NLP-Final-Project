(CNN) -- The opening race of the Formula One season, the Bahrain Grand Prix, has been axed due to ongoing political unrest in the country.
"Bahrain's priority is on overcoming tragedy, healing divisions and rediscovering the fabric that draws this country together to remind the world of the very best that Bahrain is capable of as a nation once again united.
The cancellation of the race could be costly for Bahrain's economy.
As for starting in Melbourne, it's my home race and, as always, I'm looking forward to it.
We feel the decision taken by the Crown Prince is wise and we fully support it.
