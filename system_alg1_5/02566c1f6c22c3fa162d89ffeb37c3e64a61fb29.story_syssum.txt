"He told me he would use a different exit every day because he was fearful for his life," Dunbar told CNN.
"I hope that the people that did this are watching, because we're very confident that we're going to find you," McLelland told reporters.
CNN's Ed Lavendera reported from Kaufman, and AnneClaire Stapleton and Holly Yan from Atlanta.
