But, at its core, Harkaways says "Tigerman" is a story about fatherhood and the "power of paternal and filial love."
The book deals with darker themes of justice and vengeance, similar to another hero with father issues, "Batman."
"It's the most real, in a way, of the books I've written."
After years of ecological abuse, Mancreu has become an environmental disaster.
When a group of gun-toting thugs kills a mutual friend, the boy inspires Ferris to become "Tigerman," part vigilante, part myth and "full of win," as the boy says.
But "Tigerman" isn't so much his version of "Batman" as it is his take "on me, or any of us, shoved into being a costumed hero," he says.
For now, Harkaway is already at work on his next novel about "semiotics, murder, alchemy, sharks, banking, game design and the surveillance state," he said.
He's also making time for fatherhood, something he describes as "the best, and the most extreme" adventure.
