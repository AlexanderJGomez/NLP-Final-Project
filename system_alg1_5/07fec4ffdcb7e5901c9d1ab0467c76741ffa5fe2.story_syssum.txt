The gels, AndroGel and Testim, are approved for use in men who produce little or no testosterone.
Some women use testosterone gel products off-label, perhaps to increase sex drive, but the FDA has not approved these products for any reason in women.

The current labels instruct users to wash their hands after use, and to cover treated skin with clothing.
The FDA recommends that children and women avoid contact with the places where men have applied these products.
â€¢ Note that the use of non-FDA-approved testosterone gels that can result the same effects should be avoided.
