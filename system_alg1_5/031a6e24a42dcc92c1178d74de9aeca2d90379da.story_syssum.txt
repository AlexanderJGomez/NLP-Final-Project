But the United States considers the case closed, according to William Ostick, a State Department spokesman.
The United States, which did not recognize the jurisdiction of the court in this case, resisted international pressure to pay, and eventually, under the administration of President Violeta Chamorro, Nicaragua dropped its claim from the International Court in 1991.
However, it is unlikely that Ortega would seek such a referendum, which would stir the pot with the United States, he said.
"I would think the case is now closed," he said.
