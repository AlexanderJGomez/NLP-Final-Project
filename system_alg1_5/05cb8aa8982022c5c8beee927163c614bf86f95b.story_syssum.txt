Almuhajir has turned up in the desolate scrubland, they say, to offer al Qaeda's help with famine relief.
The event, at which a large group of Somalis were shown sitting crossed-legged on the ground, was clearly a propaganda ploy by Al-Shabaab to boost its popularity -- and that of the al Qaeda brand.
