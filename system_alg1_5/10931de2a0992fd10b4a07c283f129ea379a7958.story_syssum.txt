"As part of my ongoing recovery, last week I traveled to Belgium to seek further medical advice from a leading cardiologist," the former Arsenal trainee, who represented England at under-21 level, said in a statement released by Bolton.
"While the news is devastating, I have much to be thankful for.
"To have Fabrice here and with us is truly amazing and we are all very thankful for that," he said.
Bolton manager Owen Coyle, who was at Muamba's bedside in the early part of his ordeal, echoed Gartside's sentiments.
