Soon, he plans to stand again in Cell 14, Block 2 at the Abu Salim prison in Tripoli.
Sometimes, he said, his wife would wake him up in the middle of the night, saying, "Hussein.
Since his release in 2000, Shafei had thought about Abu Salim's dead.
Shafei, now working with the opposition in Benghazi, knew he had to return there.
Or perhaps, with the fighting still raging in places like Gadhafi's hometown of Sirte, he will have to go by boat.
"We had no idea where he was," she said from her home in Atlanta.
If she was lucky, she got 20 minutes with him, she said.
Shafei spent eight years that way, in a cramped cell, without his family or the education he should have finished.
"Five or seven minutes after it started, the guards on the roofs shot at the prisoners who were in the open areas," Shafei said in an interview with Human Rights Watch many years later.
"I could not see the dead prisoners who were shot, but I could see those who were shooting," Shafei told Human Rights Watch.
The next day, Shafei was ordered to clean the blood-smeared watches taken off the wrists of the dead.
But the families, mostly from Benghazi, now the de facto rebel capital, did not abandon their longing for answers.
"It was radical," said Sarah Leah Whitson, director of the Middle East and Africa division at Human Rights Watch.
"Inna lillahi wa ilayhi rajioon," each family said.
'At least now we know,' they said."
Then in February of this year, the regime arrested Fathi Terbil, a human rights lawyer who represented some of the Abu Salim families.
"It was, after all, the Abu Salim families who kick-started this revolution.
"Hussein came here and had a mission," Nabil Shafei said.
The nation must heal, too, he believes.
He owes it to all those who survived Abu Salim.
But mostly, he owes it to the souls of the dead.
