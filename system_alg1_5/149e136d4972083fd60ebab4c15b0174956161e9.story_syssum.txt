"To me, it's a question of honor to resolve the murder of Georhiy Gongadze.
It's a question of whether or not good or evil prevails," Yushchenko said.
"As the suspected organizer of the killing, Pukach could point the investigation to those who ordered the crime nine years ago," said Nina Ognianova, the organization's Europe and Central Asia Program Coordinator.
The Ukrainian security service, the SBU, suggested Kravchenko killed himself, and the dead man's successor quoted a suicide note, according to Russian media.
But Myroslava Gongadze, the slain journalist's widow, noted Kravchenko had two bullets in his head.
Kuchma vehemently denied those charges.
