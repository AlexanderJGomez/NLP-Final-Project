British rider Cavendish, who won six stages last year, had a better day after struggling in the wet and on the cobble stones of previous runs but will be disappointed after being forced out of contention at the final sprint.
"I don't know what happened at the finish today, I just had nothing in the legs when I started to sprint.
"I think I spent too much energy to fight with Cavendish and, when Petacchi went on the left, I just couldn't sprint.
I know he's a good, strong rider but to come back to the Tour de France like he has is impressive."
We needed something like this after tough, hard, nervous, and stressful opening stages," he said.
