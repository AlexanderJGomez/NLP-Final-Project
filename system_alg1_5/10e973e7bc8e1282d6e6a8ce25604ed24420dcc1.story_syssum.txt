Montalbano, an expert on risk assessments, is one of a number of mental health professionals who has been following Hinckley's case for more than a decade.
Hinckley's experts say his most serious mental diseases are in remission, that he's made progress and can make even more if he's allowed more time outside his mental hospital.
Hinckley has not testified.
U.S. District Court Judge Paul Friedman is expected to take some time to review all the evidence before issuing a ruling on the hospital's proposal.
