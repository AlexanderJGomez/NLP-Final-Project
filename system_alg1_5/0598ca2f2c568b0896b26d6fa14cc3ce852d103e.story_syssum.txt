The case will now go to the Los Angeles city attorney to decide if a misdemeanor charge will be filed against Bieber, the "evaluation worksheet" released by the prosecutor's office said.
Bieber and the woman "tussled over it for a moment," she said.
After she showed Bieber her phone, he told her: "Why don't you leave, you're embarrassing your daughter."
Bieber posted a series of tweets days after the incident, lamenting all the "rumors" he's facing.
"The woman didn't stand out," the source said.
Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey is still considering if and how to prosecute Bieber for an alleged egging of his neighbor's home in January.
