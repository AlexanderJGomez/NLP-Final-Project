ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- More than 1,300 pounds of explosives were packed into a construction truck that detonated outside an Islamabad hotel, killing 57 people, including two Americans and a diplomat, officials said Sunday.
The suicide truck blast injured 266 people, including 11 foreigners, according to Malik.
At a news conference in Islamabad on Sunday, Pakistani authorities released security video of the blast, showing a small explosion inside the truck before the larger, deadly explosion.
"I am not in a position to tell you who has done it, but [in] all the previous investigations, all the roads have gone to South Waziristan," he said.
The blast also caused a natural gas leak that set the top floor of the five-story, 258-room hotel on fire, police said.
Most of the fatalities appeared to be drivers, who were waiting with their cars outside the Marriott, and hotel security guards, Geo TV's Hamid Mir said.
A few hours after the attack, Zardari addressed the nation on television, saying he knows the pain of terrorism after his wife, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, was killed in December on the campaign trail.
These people are not Muslims," he said.
"We had taken all security measures," he said.
A Pakistani staff member of the commission was also injured, it said.
