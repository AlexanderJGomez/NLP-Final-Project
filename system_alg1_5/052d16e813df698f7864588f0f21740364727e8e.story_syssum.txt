Stephen Hawking in Pasadena, California, in March.
On his Web site, Hawking has written about living with ALS.
Hawking is completely dependent on others or technology for virtually everything -- bathing, dressing, eating, even speech.
Hawking was born in Oxford, England, on what turned out to be an auspicious date: January 8, 1942 -- the 300th anniversary of the death of astronomer and physicist Galileo Galilei.
Hawking has guest-starred, as himself, on Star Trek: The Next Generation and The Simpsons.
The one major development that was not anticipated was the discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating now, rather than slowing down... We live in the most probable of all possible worlds."
