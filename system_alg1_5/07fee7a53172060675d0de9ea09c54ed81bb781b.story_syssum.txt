In the speech, Obama will explain why the United States is in Afghanistan, its interests there and his decision-making process, Gibbs said, but "the president does not see this as an open-ended engagement.
"It's a million dollars a troop for a year," he said.
It's very, very, very expensive."
There had been no final word on Obama's decision as of Tuesday, said the Defense Department official, who has direct knowledge of the process.
McChrystal took part in the meeting Monday, along with Vice President Joe Biden, Gates, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen and Karl Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador in Kabul, Afghanistan.
After the first deployment, the remaining Marines will deploy over the next three to four months, the military official said.
About 68,000 U.S. troops are in Afghanistan, along with about 45,000 from the NATO alliance.
Obama's Afghanistan plan will include "very broad terms" that show how and where the United States is succeeding in the nation, a senior U.S. military official told CNN.
U.S.-led troops invaded Afghanistan in response to the al Qaeda terrorist network's September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington.
