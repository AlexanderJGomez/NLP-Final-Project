Something is affecting the children's motor nerves, causing weakness primarily in their shoulders, triceps, biceps and hips, says Dr. Joyce Oleszek, a pediatric rehabilitation specialist at Children's Hospital Colorado.
Most of the children experienced a respiratory illness before being admitted to the hospital, although only two had a history of asthma.
"We don't know, at this point, if there is any association between the enterovirus EV-D68 that's circulating and the paralytic conditions some of the children in Colorado are experiencing," CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said.
Of those six, four tested positive for enterovirus D68, which has been sending children across North America to the hospital with severe respiratory illnesses.
Enterovirus D68 is part of the Picornaviridae family, which also includes the poliovirus, other enteroviruses and rhinoviruses.
But some types of enterovirus are more serious.
This year, enterovirus D68 seems to be exacerbating breathing problems in children who have asthma.
"Parents shouldn't panic," Nyquist says.
