Trailing to Sofiane Feghouli's first-half penalty, Belgium, tipped by many to reach the later stages of the tournament, hit back in impressive fashion.
Its captain, Vincent Kompany, was born in Brussels to parents of Congolese descent, while Romelu Lukaku, the striker, comes from a similar background.
Then there is the Tottenham triumvirate of Jan Vertonghen, Chadli and Mousa Dembele, all of whom have struggled for consistency in the Premier League.
But in Feghouli, Algeria has a player who can mix it with the very best.
Belgium, blessed with an array of attacking talent, looked stumped in its attempts to open up the Algerian defense.
In the group's late game, Russia came from behind to snatch a point against South Korea in Cuiaba.
For Fabio Capello, the Russia coach, it must have felt like Groundhog Day.
