An unbeaten Bundesliga run of 29 games, dating back to last season was also extended, but there was a worrying development for Guardiola when captain for the night, midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger, limped off with an ankle injury near the end.
"If you're only 1-0 up in the Bundesliga, things like this can always happen," Guardiola told Bayern's official website.
Konstantinos Katsouranis leveled for the home side, but Adam Szalai, with his second of the match, sealed a famous victory.
Steaua Bucharest, Austria Vienna and FC Basel will also go into Thursday's draw.
