"Even planting just one on each would result in as many trees as there are in New York's Central Park," he said.

"Even if all the trees and their installation is provided, if the residents don't subsequently get involved, then the plan will fail," said Melki.
"Aside from the major environmental and social benefits, it would also be incredibly iconic," he says.
