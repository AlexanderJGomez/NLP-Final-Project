"I would say if the demands have been met, they wouldn't be going on a hunger strike," said Kamau Walton, a member of the Prisoner Hunger Strike Solidarity Coalition.
Inmate demands include an end to long-term solitary confinement and halting what's known as the "debriefing" policy, in which inmates are required to provide information on prison gangs to get out of solitary.
The strike's leaders are in the maximum-security prison at Pelican Bay, near the Oregon state line, Walton said, but inmates in other participating lockups are encouraged to add their own demands.
State prisons house about 120,000 inmates, according to a June report from the Public Policy Institute of California.
