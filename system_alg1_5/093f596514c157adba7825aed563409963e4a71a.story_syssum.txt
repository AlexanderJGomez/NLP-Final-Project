(CNN) -- ISON, the most closely watched comet in recent years, may be falling apart as it nears its close encounter with the sun.

Whatever its final fate, she said, ISON has "provided a wonderful window into the world of comets.
ISON was discovered in September of 2012 by astronomers Vitali Nevski and Artyom Novichonok using a telescope near Kislovodsk, Russia, that is part of the International Scientific Optical Network (ISON).
"From the moment of discovery, ISON has been a confusing, frustrating, dynamic and unpredictable object.
But for now, we wait to learn ISON's fate.
