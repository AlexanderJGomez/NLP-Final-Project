Dawn's death has been the subject of thousands of articles, broadcast news stories, blogs, books, and now a feature film called "Blackfish."
They do so not to inform but, rather, regrettably, because of the desire to sensationalize.
But anyone approaching this subject in good faith must recognize a simple fact: Our staff has interacted with killer whales -- for veterinary care, training, shows, educational presentations, husbandry, exercise, play and enrichment -- hundreds of times a day for nearly 50 years.
In the three years since Dawn's death, we have again made significant changes at SeaWorld.
No, it does not.
Blackfish, like other works driven by the same agenda, ignores the extraordinary benefits to conservation, scientific research and education of America's zoo and aquariums.
That, not the inaccurate and shamefully misleading account in "Blackfish," is what SeaWorld really is.
