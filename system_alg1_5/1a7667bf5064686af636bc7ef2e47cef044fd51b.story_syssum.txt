I have learned to live with the loss of my son, Mohammad Salman Hamdani.
On that terrible day, my husband Saleem and I could not know where Salman was.
We couldn't know it then, but what had happened to Salman that morning, along with the events of the following months, changed everything for our family, bringing unbearable pain into our lives and suddenly making us public persons.
On that crisp and glorious morning, I drove away from our home in Bayside, Queens.
When Zeshan and I left the house, at about 7:15, Salman was still sleeping.
In the months that followed, in addition to uncertainty about Salman, our family had to endure suspicion pointed at him.
Yet, at the 9/11 Memorial, his name is grouped among the miscellaneous victims, not among the first responders who sacrificed their lives, where it belongs.
He is my strength, and I am his voice.
