Dionne and William Galston conclude, "In less than a decade, public opinion has shifted dramatically toward support for the legalization of marijuana.
Indeed it has.
And finally there's this: recently published polls by Gallup, Pew, Quinnipiac University and Public Policy Polling all find that far more Americans now favor legalizing marijuana for adults than believe in its continued prohibition.
Furthermore, the criminalization of cannabis simply doesn't work.
Marijuana regulations can allow governments to establish legal parameters for where, when, and how markets operate.
Society would clearly benefit from this.
