The four groups jointly calling for charges to be dropped are Amnesty International, the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), Front Line Defenders and Human Rights Watch.
"We consider all five men prisoners of conscience and call on the UAE authorities to release them unconditionally," said Philip Luther, Middle East and North Africa deputy director at Amnesty International.
All were arrested on the heels of a recent decision by the UAE's government to dissolve the elected board of directors of the Jurist Association, a prominent civil rights organization in that country, and replace it with state appointees, according to Human Rights Watch.
The UAE are "reacting to domestic criticisms by banning websites, detaining peaceful activists and intensifying its chokehold on civil society," Human Rights Watch claims.
The country has not faced street protests, but authorities are sensitive to the unrest sweeping the Arab world.
More than 8 million people live in the UAE, but Emiratis account for only 11.5% of that total.
