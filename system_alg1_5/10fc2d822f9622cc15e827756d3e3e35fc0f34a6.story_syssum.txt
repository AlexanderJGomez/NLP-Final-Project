(CNN) -- Maurice Sendak, author of the classic children's book "Where the Wild Things Are," has died, a spokeswoman for HarperCollins Publishers said Tuesday.
He died Tuesday in Danbury, Connecticut, of complications from a recent stroke.
"Where the Wild Things Are" won the Caldecott Medal in 1964, considered the most prestigious award for illustrated children's books.
"I don't know how to do a children's book.
I don't even know what a children's book is.
"Children can distort, and play with figures and ideas, with a fluidity that strains us -- which we grow out of," he said.
