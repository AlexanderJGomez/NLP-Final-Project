"My number one hope is for North and South Korea to become united," he told CNN's Human to Hero series.
The Korean community in Japan has an uneasy relationship, at best, with the indigenous population, amid a perpetual state of mistrust on both sides.
"I think 90% of the Vegalta's supporters don't care about whether he is North Korean or Japanese," local businessman Shuichi Kanno, a loyal club fan, told CNN.
"I wondered if people would cheer me, a North Korean, but once I was on the team and started playing, I felt l like I was being supported a lot," he said.
Strict loyalty to that regime is engendered, and that is the education that Ryang received up until high school when, thanks to his sporting and academic achievements, he entered the mainstream Japanese university system.
It was not long before international recognition arrived -- though not for Japan ("I have never thought about it") but through his upbringing and family ties, for North Korea.
Ryang did impress enough to secure further call-ups, one of a small cadre of Japan-based players with a similar background, who represent North Korea.
"During the tsunami year, Vegalta and his play gave us an energy, whether they won or lost," Kanno said.
Ryang's international career has involved intermittent trips to Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, where he joins up with the domestic based players.
Despite his personal disappointment, he describes North Korea's narrow 2-1 defeat by the five-time world champion Brazil team  as his "most memorable match, a moving experience."
"Soccer is part of my life, and it's also my job and I never get tired of it," he said.
I do not have any favorite model, but when I am allowed to test drive one, I love it instantly and end up buying it," he says.
"As I am not a player blessed with speed, I tend to drive a fast car.
