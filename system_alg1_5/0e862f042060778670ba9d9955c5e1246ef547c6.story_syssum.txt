Sun Myung Moon, founder of the church colloquially known as the Moonies, is unconscious and undergoing treatment for pneumonia at a hospital in South Korea, a spokesman said Thursday.
He was "virulently anti-Communist," having been imprisoned in North Korea during the Korean War before being freed by the allies, she said.
Moon is the founder of The Washington Times newspaper, which vocally backed Reagan, she said.
Followers of the church worldwide are praying for his health, he said.
