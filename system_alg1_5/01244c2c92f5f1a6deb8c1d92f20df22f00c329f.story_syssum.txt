Retired Col. John Leech narrowly escaped death at the Pentagon on September 11, 2001.
"Wow.
It makes you weak in the knees to see these pictures," Leech said.
The shock, he said, was indescribable.
It rattled you right down to the bone," Leech said.
He remembers people screaming, "bloodcurdling screams."
"I mean, I inhaled a lot of jet fuel vapors, and I got dusted up, but that was the extent of my injuries."
Seven years after that horrible day, Leech visited the chapel at the new Pentagon Memorial, a two-acre park, which opens to the public Thursday.
"I've avoided ... anything to do with 9/11, so it feels good to be here," he said.
A lot of very good people."
