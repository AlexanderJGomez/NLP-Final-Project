GALVESTON, Texas (CNN)  -- Rescuers in Galveston, Texas, were going door-to-door Saturday to check on the estimated 20,000 people who failed to flee Hurricane Ike, which has slowed to tropical storm status.
"The road buckled in a number of places," LeBlanc said.
"This eye came right over us, stayed a while and went on, but it brought a lot of damage to our city."
"The windows looked like they would explode," said Knight, a mother of two.
"I didn't think it would be as bad as it was," she said.
However, flooding and debris have impeded rescue efforts in some areas, adding to the uncertainty about how many Texans actually survived the storm.
A foot of water flooded the city's main courthouse, where many people rode out the storm, she said.
"We lost everything," Jamie Holmes.
The city's tallest skyscraper, the 75-story JP Morgan Chase Tower, was missing many of its windows.
Brennan's, a popular restaurant in downtown Houston for almost four decades, burned down Friday night as Ike battered the city.
"There's lots of debris in the streets, like boards and plywood from homes."
Hurricane Ike proved to be a huge storm system, 900 miles across at its largest.
The storm surge, however, was smaller than forecast.
Rescuers fanned out in boats Saturday in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, after the storm surge flooded 1,800 homes.
"I filled up my tank yesterday morning on the way to work for $3.59 a gallon," he said.
"The credit goes to the mother," said Dr. Mark Burns, who helped deliver the baby.
