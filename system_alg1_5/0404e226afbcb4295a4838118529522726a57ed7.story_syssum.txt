China will have a major leadership change soon when the current leaders, President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao, bow out.
After three decades of reforms, China's social economic landscape has been transformed.
Despite the Party's calls to "speak with one voice," dissenting ideas and differences are being voiced and heard.
The statue's appearance in such a prominent location caused an uproar among neoliberals, neo-Maoists and the intellectual elite.
The provincial Party Secretary, Wang Yang, tipped for promotion to the Politburo Standing Committee, is widely regarded as a daring leader, willing to promote changes based on the market and open society principles.
On the other hand, Bo, who had been a contender for the Standing Committee until his downfall, had been known for advocating Maoist tactics, including mass rallies and anticrime campaigns to counter problems like organized crime and corruption.
His downfall has put neo-Maoists on the retreat, but there are signs they are ready to become vocal, as the new leaders take over.
As Hu's 10-year term comes to an end, his cautious and above-the-fray approach to economic reforms and ideological debates may have come to an end as well.
