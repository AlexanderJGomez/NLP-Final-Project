Jackson Hole, China (CNN) -- Looking for a weekend escape from the city, Annie Liu and her husband fell in love at first sight with a log home in Jackson Hole and bought it for less than $300,000.
Still, wealthy locals are lured to this sprawling development by the promise of living in the "Wild West."
"Many people have been to the United States and enjoy the environment there," Lu, 55, added.
"We like the States and we like the lifestyle," Liu said.
Although the Pew study finds Chinese public perceptions of the United States becoming less favorable in 2012, it notes: "There is one constant: richer, younger, more educated, and urban Chinese all express a more positive view of (the soft power) aspects of America's image.
"For those who can afford to buy houses here, they have enough money," he explained.
"This is an 'American' community so it's a necessary element here," said Liu as she walked out of the soon-to-open Jackson Hole church.
