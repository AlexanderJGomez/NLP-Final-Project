"In this case, my office examined newly discovered scientific evidence that was not available at the time of the trial," Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth P. Thompson said in statement to CNN.
Zachary Margulis-Ohuma, Yarbough's attorney, is glad justice has finally been served.
Yarbough was just 18, and Wilson only 15, when they were accused of murder.
Wilson was offered a deal by the district attorney's office for a nine-years-to-life sentence, but his case was disputed after he wrote Yarbough's family in 2005 saying that he had lied at the trial.
"I'm feeling really blessed right," Yarbough said.
I wish him and his family nothing but the best," Yarbough said.
"It was hard to keep my hopes up, but God is good now, I'm out now, I'm free, thank God," Yarbough said.
