If "The Stranger" hadn't been a success, Billy Joel suspects he would have been dropped from his label.
At a 1976 Columbia Records convention in Toronto, Joel opened a musical showcase and "ripped the crowd up," Ramone recalls in a phone interview from Connecticut.
"I watched what he had done and tracked his past records," he says.
Joel came through with a top-notch set of songs, and four of them -- "Just the Way You Are," "Movin' Out," "She's Always a Woman" and "Only the Good Die Young" -- became hits.
He acknowledges, though, that "The Stranger" could have been his last stand.
He and Joel hit it off at "an Italian lunch that took forever," Ramone says, and in July went into the studio to record.
It was an accident that Ramone ended up included in the group portrait on the album's back cover, dressed in New York Yankee regalia -- "I only posed because I thought, 'They'll never use this,' " he says.
Then there was Joel, a forceful singer who, Ramone observes, is also "extremely vulnerable."
("A chick song," he's called it.)
And then out of nowhere came 'Just the Way You Are,' " Ramone says.
1 records "52nd Street" and "Glass Houses," and still maintain a warm relationship, says Ramone.
