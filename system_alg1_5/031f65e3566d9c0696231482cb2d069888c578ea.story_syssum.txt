Charlotte (CNN) -- Four years later, consider the role reversal: As he closes his convention, Barack Obama's greatest challenge is to make the case against change.
But if Washington has changed at all, it is for the worse.
Still, because of the changed climate, the Obama acceptance speech will close a Democratic convention that for the most part has been a giant get-out-the-vote rally, speakers chosen because of their appeal to specific constituencies (African-Americans, Latinos, suburban women, gays and lesbians) or major battleground states.
"Hopefully, at the end of this convention, people will say we accomplished what we needed to and delivered our vision for the country and offered a clear contrast to what people saw in Tampa," the president said.
Thursday night, Obama's challenge is to sell his road map.
Voters, albeit by a narrow margin, view Romney as better able to manage the economy.
But for all the help he is getting from his friends, it is up to Obama himself to close the deal.
