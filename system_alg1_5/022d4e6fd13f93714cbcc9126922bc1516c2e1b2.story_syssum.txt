I was enjoying my afternoon off, comfortable in the warmth of our home, watching the snow from a rare winter storm blanket our deck and backyard.
As a journalist, I recognized that a news story was breaking before me.
More than three hours later, she still hadn't moved very far.
The kids hadn't eaten.
They told me, "We don't know sir.
By this time, I was so angry, I couldn't think straight.
My wife later told me she cried only once, around 5 a.m., not knowing when she was going to be able to get the children home.
That's also about when I lost it, I told her -- about 5 a.m.
"I didn't let the girls see me cry," she said.
I told them if police couldn't get my family , it was time for me to try.
I said, "Don't worry about that.
Against advice of the local and state authorities, I'm going to try."
Then I escorted my wife into Ken's vehicle.
I was leading my family home.
