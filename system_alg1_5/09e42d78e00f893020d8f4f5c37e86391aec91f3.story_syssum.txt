Apple has long been unapologetically focused on design and Zufi, a native of Melbourne, Australia, said he wanted to celebrate that with his images.
"Other companies came up with the guts for a machine and then the engineers would find a way to stuff them into a box," said Zufi.
"I didn't want to take photos that you could find in marketing material," he said.
"I don't really remember seeing a lot of the photos of the back," he said.
"Within these pages, Jonathan presents a thoughtful and artistic gift to Apple fans and employees alike; photographs of Apple products -- from hardware to packaging -- the likes of which I've never seen compiled before," he writes.
"Jonathan's passion for this project is reflected on every page, and each honors the hard work of every employee and collaborator that has passed through Apple's doors."
