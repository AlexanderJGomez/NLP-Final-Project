She fed him, she gave him money.
Police said they are looking for at least one more suspect, but they believe Nowsch was the shooter.

Tammy Meyers, 44, took off for home and sent her daughter inside.
Robert Meyers, who was out of town when his wife was shot, said the other car followed the Meyers and at some point away from the house there were gunshots.

There's the animal, a block away.
Robert Meyers screamed.
