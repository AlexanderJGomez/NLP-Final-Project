(CNN) -- There was a plane ticket from Perugia, Italy, to Seattle, Washington, with Amanda Knox's name on it.
Now, as closing arguments in Amanda Knox's appeal come to an end, one thing remains the same for the Knox parents: A plane ticket home.
Prosecutors alleged at trial that on the night of November 1, 2007, at a small house in the college town of Perugia, Knox directed her then-boyfriend Rafaelle Sollecito and a third defendant Rudy Guede, to hold Kercher down as Knox played with a knife before slashing Kercher's throat.
Knox's parents, like her defense attorneys, said their daughter was not involved in the murder and that evidence presented at trial was thin and clouded by shoddy police work.
Now, two years after Knox's conviction, Knox's parents are fighting a similar battle during her appeal.
They asked for an independent examination of the evidence, but it was denied.
During the appeal, one of the independent forensic experts who studied the original evidence told the court that the DNA alleged to be Kercher's that was on the knife could not have been from blood.
At trial, the prosecution said a bra clasp found on the bloodied crime scene floor had Sollecito's DNA on it and proved he was in Kercher's room when the murder occurred.
Curt Knox said he feels there is "no case left" against his daughter.
The review had been "embarrassing, inappropriate, and presented in a hostile way" and was not based on science, she said.
Guede, who was convicted earlier of the crime, has admitted being in the villa where Kercher was killed, but has said an unknown assailant killed her while he was out of the room during his trial.
Bongiorno also attacked the media portrayal of Knox as a "femme fatale," which he said swayed the outcome of the trial.
"It really appears to me that they want to find the truth," he said during the appeal.
