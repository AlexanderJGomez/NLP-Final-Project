(CNN) -- Bea Arthur, the actress best known for her roles as television's "Maude" and the sardonic Dorothy on "The Golden Girls," has died of cancer, a family spokesman said Saturday.
In the '70s, "Maude" was ahead of the social curve, tackling hot topics not usually mentioned on situation comedies -- pornography, race relations and, in an episode titled "Maude's Dilemma," abortion.
During the Depression, Arthur's family left the Big Apple and opened a clothing store in Cambridge, Maryland.
Arthur left "Maude" in 1978, making television and some film appearances afterward.
White, McClanahan and Getty continued for another season on the show, renamed "The Golden Palace," but the show lasted only one season without Arthur.
In the early part of this decade, Arthur appeared in several one-woman shows.
