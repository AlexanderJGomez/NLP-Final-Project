According to the new federal law, school districts will have to provide water in student eating areas, but the law doesn't discuss accessibility.
Advocates say, and many educators admit, that too many of America's largest school districts elect not to provide cups.
In the New York City Department of Education, the largest school district in the country by number of students, cups are "generally available to all students," but spokesperson Margie Feinberg cannot say in which of its schools cups are available only upon request.

Researchers in Germany found that by installing a cooled, filtered water fountain with plain or optionally carbonated water, providing children with water bottles, educating them on the importance of drinking water and encouraging them to fill up their water bottles, they were able to reduce the risk of children becoming overweight by 31%.
When children have to take their water bottles home, they start forgetting to bring them back, and water consumption declines, according to a pilot program in a Los Angeles school.
"If the federal government let us offer water as part of a reimbursable meal, then the children, many of them, instead of taking a milk or juice, would take a water."
"I see how much the kids really like the water," she says.
"It is documented that if we provide the choices for them they will really go for it."
