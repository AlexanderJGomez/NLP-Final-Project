Unfortunately, this strategy of promoting homegrown extremism has demonstrated some successes, such as Maj. Nidal Hasan's killing of 13 people at the Fort Hood, Texas, military base in 2009 and the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, which authorities have said were carried out by Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev.
So far, nine Americans have been charged with attempting to support or supporting ISIS or Nusra, according to a count by New America.
Of the 51 plots to conduct an attack inside the United States since 9/11, nearly half were initiated while the suspects were under surveillance by informants, according to a count by New America.
Today, there are more than 40,000.
Before 9/11, the budget was around a third of that figure: $26 billion.
