In the era before the printing press, handwriting was a highly specialized and labor-intensive monastic discipline, one undertaken only by those who had committed their lives to the church.
"Each monastery would have its own scriptorium, if it was not extraordinarily poor.
"The leaders of the scriptorium were looking for people who cared enough about books and writing to dedicate their entire lives to the process," he said.
"The real purpose of writing was to propagate the word of God, and to regulate the worship of God," Sanders said.
"That's what kept handwriting alive, and why it was taught as a vocation."
"In the early era, while scribes were still working to produce books, before the printing press, you just hired a scribe if you were rich," he continued.
Every serious work of the time, including Geoffrey Chaucer's legendary "Canterbury Tales," employed this script.
Then, as the Renaissance movement began to take root in Europe, Continental Humanist writers began to revive Carolingian lettering, a form of script predating the Gothic style.
"Literally, it's the power to control the pen, and the power to control what the pen perpetuates," Sanders said.
"People's interest in this debate about cursive handwriting, typing, texting and other incarnations of the language -- this is proof that these things still have the power to move us.
