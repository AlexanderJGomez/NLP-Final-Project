Repairs will be made aboard the Antalina, which has a broken fuel pump, while at sea, O'Berry said.
The crew members aboard the Antalina, a Cypriot-flagged freighter, are all in good health, said Coast Guard Cmdr.
In Liverpool, Texas, south of Houston, a family called for help around 1 a.m. Saturday when a tree crashed into their house, but authorities concluded that strong winds made it too dangerous to respond, said Doc Adams, Brazoria County's emergency management coordinator.
"You want to take care of people, and when you can't, it's tough," Adams said.
The stranded freighter had been headed south through the Gulf of Mexico from Port Arthur, Texas, but "lost main propulsion 90 miles southeast of Galveston" and was unable to steer, the Coast Guard said.
On Friday before the storm hit, authorities picked up more than 120 people stranded by rising seas along the southeast Texas coast.
"Some of them took convincing, some of them didn't," Smith said.
Three HH-65C helicopters from Coast Guard Air Station Houston rescued more than 20 people and continued to fly rescue missions until weather grounded them Friday evening, said Petty Officer Renee Aiello, a station spokeswoman.
