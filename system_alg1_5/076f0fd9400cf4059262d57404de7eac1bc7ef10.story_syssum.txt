Also Monday, Germany's minister for agriculture and consumer affairs, Ilse Aigner, published an initiative for animal feed safety in reaction to the scandal.
Meanwhile, Danish investigators said Monday they are looking into the possibility that contaminated animal feed from Germany may have been given to hens in Denmark.
Such hens are bred for their eggs, and not sold for their meat, he said.
Criminal charges have been filed against the company, Seifert said, "because they did not immediately inform" the agricultural ministry that dioxin levels surpassed the allowed amount.
They did not do either," Seifert said.
The conduct is still wrong," he said.
About 130,000 possibly contaminated eggs were exported from a company in Germany to a food company in Netherlands, where they were to be used in industrial food production, said Holger Eichele, a spokesman for Germany's Ministry for Agriculture and Consumer Protection.
