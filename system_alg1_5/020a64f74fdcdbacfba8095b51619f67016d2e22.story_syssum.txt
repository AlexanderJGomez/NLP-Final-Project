London, England (CNN) -- British police questioned four members of the Pakistani national cricket team after allegations surfaced that gamblers fixed part of a match against England, the manager of the Pakistani team said Sunday.
The video of the meeting -- which the newspaper said took place Wednesday, the day before the match between Pakistan and England began -- is intercut with clips from the following two days, where the players perform as Majeed said they would.
No players or team officials have been arrested, the International Cricket Council said Sunday.
"We have given our best," Butt said after his team lost to England.
England beat Pakistan in the four-day match at Lord's cricket ground, which ended Sunday afternoon, after the scandal broke.
"It's a legitimate story to get to the bottom of something that's been plaguing our sport," he said.
However, Shakil Shaikh, president of the Islamabad Regional Cricket Association, told CNN that while he is "shocked" at the news, "no proof has been given of the involvement of these players in the match-fixing issue" and he has seen no concrete evidence against the cricketers.
International and local cricket officials will not be issuing further comment "as this is now subject to a police investigation," the council said in a statement.
"What we're discovering is that corruption has never gone away," Miller said via telephone from London.
"We believe this is really huge, and could be affecting other areas of cricket," Peters said.
