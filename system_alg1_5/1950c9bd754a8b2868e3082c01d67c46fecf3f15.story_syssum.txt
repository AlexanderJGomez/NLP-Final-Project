Police released a photo of Korena Roberts, who is charged with murder.
Korena Roberts, 28, is charged with murder in Snively's death.
"Doctors at the hospital could not revive the baby," said sheriff's Sgt.
"At this time, it has not been determined if [Snively] died because of head wounds she received or as a result of cutting injuries she received to her abdomen," said a Monday statement from the Washington County, Oregon, Sheriff's Office.
Heidi Kidd, Snively's mother, told CNN affiliate KPTV that her daughter met Roberts on Craigslist, a classified ads Web site, and the two were to exchange baby clothes.
Roberts' boyfriend is cooperating with police, and has not been charged in the case, authorities said.
