With fiscal uncertainty and tight budgets hitting government agencies, NOAA had to make tough choices, said the agency's director of communications.
"NOAA's plans to furlough operational employees at the National Weather Service as we enter the severe storm, flood and hurricane season is unnecessary and places the public at great risk," said Hirn, general counsel for the National Weather Service Employees Organization.
NOAA's hurricane hunters, who bear the responsibility of flying into storms and taking crucial data, will still fly this season, although civilian flight crew members will alternately be furloughed.
NOAA administrators said the impact on public services will be "minimized," and if a major weather event requires more staff, furloughs would be canceled.
Where once there were 10 forecasters per office, now many operate with four or five, he said.
