According to the polls in the Hawkeye State, Ron Paul and Mitt Romney are virtually tied for the lead, each with no more than a quarter of the vote.
It's just an embarrassment.
As recently noted by The Wall Street Journal, a recent Gallup poll of Republicans put support for Romney at 24%, and last month, his level of support floated between 22% and 25%.
In fact, even in this late hour, Republican thought leaders such as William Kristol, publisher of the Weekly Standard, are still suggesting that another Republican candidate could enter the race.
And, despite all the campaigning up to this point, nearly 20% of voters are still undecided about whom to support.
Unfortunately for Democrats, he's not doing a good job of inspiring either.
Today, it's only about 56%.
Add all this up, and this could be an election with one of the lowest turnouts in history -- for Republicans and Democrats.
