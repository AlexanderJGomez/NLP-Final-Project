"Two months out of the almost two years that the girls have served is not much," Tolokonnikova's husband, Pyotr Verzilov, told CNN.
But Tolokonnikova, released from a Siberian facility on Monday, told CNN she felt that the amnesty was a publicity stunt to bolster the government's image before it hosts the Winter Olympics in February.
In October, she was transferred to a Siberian facility for medical treatment, and she remained there until her release Monday.
Others are not so lucky, she said.
Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova have young children and therefore qualified for the amnesty, Russian media reported.
