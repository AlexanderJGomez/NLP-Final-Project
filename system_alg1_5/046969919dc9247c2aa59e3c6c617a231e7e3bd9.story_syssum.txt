"The media attention to protests in Delhi has raised awareness on issues of violence against women in Nepal," said Manju Gurung, of Pourakhi, an organization that advocates for female migrant workers.
Their outrage focused on several cases of alleged rape and abuse against women, including that of the migrant worker, whom they refer to as Sita Rai.
On November 18, the woman returned home to Nepal on vacation from Saudi Arabia, where she works as a domestic worker, said Basanta Bahadur Basnet, a lawyer who represents the woman.
The airport police officer, Parsuram Basnet, faces charges of rape and cheating.
Although married, he had told the woman that he would marry her, his attorney said.
She is now receiving counseling, according to Gurung, who works with female migrant workers.
