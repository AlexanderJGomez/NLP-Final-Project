"Israel is nothing more than a mosquito which cannot see the broad horizon of the Iranian nation," he said Saturday in northeastern Iran's Khorassan province, according to the semi-official Fars news agency.
"With the force of God behind it, we shall soon experience a world without the United States and Zionism," he said then, according to another IRNA report.
And Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, last Friday "blasted the U.S. war-mongering rhetoric against Iran," including President Barack Obama's assertion that "all options are on the table."
Before then, discussions in Vienna, Austria, will be held on Monday and Tuesday to address "outstanding issues and remove ambiguities," Iran's envoy to the International Atomic Energy Agency Ali-Asghar Soltanieh said, according to Fars.
