Las Vegas, Nevada (CNN) -- Google doesn't have a booth at the Consumer Electronics Show, but the company's Android software is practically everywhere.
All three, from Motorola's Atrix 4G, HTC's Inspire 4G and Samsung's Infuse 4G, were Androids.
During the week of CES, Sprint Nextel announced one new phone, the Evo Shift 4G from HTC, which runs on  -- take a guess.
It's based on the operating system that runs the PlayBook, and these "super phones," as he reportedly called them, will have fast dual-core processors inside.
Needless to say, the crowd was not impressed.
Despite these statements of breadth, Android was practically the only act in town this week.
Expecting to make money from ads, Google provides Android for free to gadget makers to install, tinker with and sell on phones.

With tablets, Android is clearly rising as a top choice for manufacturers, but it's not alone.
But at CES, Android is the star.
