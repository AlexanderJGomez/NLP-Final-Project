(CNN) -- The Boston Bruins won their first Stanley Cup in 39 years, defeating the Vancouver Canucks 4-0 Wednesday night in the seventh and deciding game of the National Hockey League's annual championship.
After dropping the first two games in Vancouver, the Bruins took four of the last five games from the Canucks, who struggled to stay in Game Seven after going down 1-0 in the first period.
"We knew the second goal was going to be huge," Marchand, the 23-year-old rookie said in a post-game interview.
Coming into the series, Vancouver was considered the superior squad on special teams, especially on power plays.
The Bruins now have won the Stanley Cup six times, fourth-most among all NHL franchises, but hadn't captured the sport's most coveted prize since 1972.
Holding the home-ice advantage, they won the first two games of the series, but lost all three games played in Boston before losing at home on Wednesday.
