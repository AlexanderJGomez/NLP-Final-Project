That's changing, however, as more airlines are realizing wi-fi's earning potential.
"More travelers are aware of our service, and many of them want it," says Small.
Row 44 also installs wi-fi on airplanes, though unlike Gogo, it relies on a satellite system, meaning passengers can access internet even when flying over the ocean.
"This is a distinct advantage, given that two-thirds of the planet is covered in water," notes John LaValle, Row 44's CEO.
Some carriers, however, find it's worth the price.
"After that, we decided to keep it free."
Would you pay for in-flight wi-fi, or should it be free?
