Doubt it.
We all get along.
But I also see others around me who, on the surface, may roll with a similar crowd, listen to the same music, say the right things, but who are also slowly being infected with the American disease of racial bias.
As it should.
Sure, we have come a long way.
But, for my generation, there are still real problems.
Racism, as with all other prejudices, has to be attacked at the source.
That was in 2000.
Parents intervened, the skirmish ceased, and each of us was swiftly scolded.
It is a learned characteristic.
Today, we live in an age of tolerance.
For us, technology is a given.
We are trapped in between two worlds, the new and the old.
It will be on us.
