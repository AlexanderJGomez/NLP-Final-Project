It capped a miserable week for Chelsea, who were knocked out of the League Cup by Blackburn in a penalty shootout on Wednesday.
However, Given turned away England midfielder Lampard's poor spot-kick, and the visitors were unable to rally again as captain John Terry went off with a knee injury.
Manchester United, on the other hand, had no such worries as they continued the form that saw them brush aside Tottenham in the quarterfinals of the League Cup on Tuesday.
Arsene Wenger's team bounced back from successive 3-0 defeats by Chelsea and Manchester City, the latter in the League Cup quarterfinals in midweek, to win 2-0 at home to mid-table Stoke.
Birmingham City moved up to eighth place after winning 3-2 at Wigan Athletic, with Alex McLeish's side coming from a goal down to score three in 11 second-half minutes as Sebastian Larsson scored with two free-kicks and Colombia striker Christian Benitez netted the other.
Wigan, who led through a superb strike from Charles N'Zogbia, pulled one back at the end through Jordi Gomez but the defeat left Robert Martinez's frustratingly inconsistent side in 14th place -- four points above the drop zone.
