The bodies of the boys, aged between 9 and 13, were found by a trash collector on Friday in Bijie in China's southwestern Guizhou province, Xinhua reported.
One user on Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter, wrote: "China is supposedly an intermediate developed country but still can't protect its own children.
Days after their deaths, details of the boys' lives emerged in local press.
"At first, I sent (my son) back to school by force," Tao said.
However, Dale Rutstein of UNICEF China said up to 1.5 million children were thought to be fending for themselves across the country but, given the fluid nature of homelessness, it was hard to keep track.
"We would say in UNICEF that that's one of the most significant challenges for China right now, because all the data shows these children have lower nutrition, suffer a higher rate of accidents and injuries and are at greater risk of abuse and exploitation," Rutstein said.
Once sent back, the children would be placed in government-run shelters, according to Xinhua.
This would enable them to have their children live with them," it said.
"Hope they won't feel cold anymore in heaven," @Qingyu_aneya said.
The boys were Tao Zhongjing, 12; Tao Zhonghong, 11; Tao Zhonglin, 13; Tao Chong, 12; and Tao Bo, 9.
