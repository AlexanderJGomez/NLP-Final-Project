The three images showed Putin meeting with the head of the Supreme Court in Moscow on Friday, the Kremlin said.
"When the sun comes up in spring, and as soon as spring is in the air, then the fever begins," Peskov said.
The Kremlin press office said Friday that Putin would meet Monday with his Kyrgyz counterpart, Almazbek Atambayev, in the Russian city of St. Petersburg, Tass said.
Since then, he has had a number of meetings, but no video was released, only stills uploaded to the Kremlin's website.
