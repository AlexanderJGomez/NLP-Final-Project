"We were still on ascent, and the engine blew out," he said.
"All of a sudden, the captain came on and said brace for a landing, and that's when we knew we were going down," he said.
At first, it felt like the plane was gliding, Berretta said, as if no engines were working.
Some said that as the plane hit, there were extremely loud noises.
"The plane was jockeying about, spinning a bit," Berretta said.
"It seemed like it lasted an eternity," Berretta said.
When they were safely out of the plane, Berretta said, there was one more moment of fear.
"I think the pilot, he did a great job," Berretta said.
"I think it was as good of a landing as you can make in a river."
