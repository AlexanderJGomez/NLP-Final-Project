Ripken, 74, was safe and resting with relatives Wednesday after a nearly daylong ordeal, authorities said.
Aberdeen police said that they have no knowledge of a ransom being demanded or paid, and that Cal Ripken apparently wasn't contacted.
The official said the suspect made no mention of Cal Ripken, an indication that he might not have known she is the mother of a famous former baseball player.
"This has been a very trying time for our family, but we are grateful and relieved that mom is back with us, safe and healthy," the statement said.
His father, Cal Ripken Sr., was a manager, coach and scout who worked in the Orioles organization for 36 years.
