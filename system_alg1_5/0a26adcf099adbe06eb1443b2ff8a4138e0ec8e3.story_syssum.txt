Her mother, Tonya Hobbs, 37, was found dead inside a parked RV Sunday night, the bureau said.
Lester Hobbs, 46, and Aja are missing and are presumed to be in Hobbs' car, said investigators who issued an Amber Alert to try to find her.
Lester Hobbs and Aja were gone, Goss said.
The Comanche County, Oklahoma, Sheriff's Office said Aja has a medical condition that requires medication.
"We know that she does need some medication," and authorities were checking leads regarding that, he said.
Lester Hobbs was supposed to appear in court in Lincoln County, Oklahoma, on a DUI charge, Goss said, and did not appear, so a warrant has been issued for him.
Lester Hobbs is about 6-foot-1 and 190 pounds, with hazel eyes and brown hair, according to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation.
