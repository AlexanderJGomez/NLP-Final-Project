James Michael Biela, 27, is accused of killing 19-year-old Brianna Denison.
For Nancy Grace's Cold Case team, the arrest also marks a milestone.
Biela, a former Marine, is charged with murdering Denison by strangulation.
And, police say, Biela is a suspect in the November 2007 parking lot assault of another UNR student.
The victim, a UNR student,  was able to escape her attacker and describe him in detail, police say.
Police say Biela's associates told them he left Reno in a hurry in March, shortly after Denison's body was found.
The tipster caught investigators' attention, telling the Secret Witness tip line about Biela's pickup and suspicious ex-girlfriend.
Detectives immediately followed up on the tip and, with permission from the former girlfriend, took DNA samples from Biela's 4-year-old son.
When first questioned about the Denison case in early November, Biela refused to submit DNA samples and provided an alibi to police, claiming that he'd been with his girlfriend.
Now, it's up to the courts to decide.
