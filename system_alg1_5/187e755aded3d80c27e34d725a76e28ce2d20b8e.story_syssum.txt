Paddy Power, a popular Irish bookmaker, is one such company.
In the last few days, possibly looking to take advantage of the odds, a sizable amount of money has been coming in for Romney, according to FÃ©ilim Mac An Iomaire, a spokesperson for Paddy Power.

Back at Paddy Power, Iomaire jokes that Americans may not be the best people to bet on their own election.
The people betting, like Chris, see it differently, though.
"Maybe the information is useful, but then again, that perspective opens up the risk that this time is different.
But it is a very close election," he said.
