Just three weeks ago, Fowle -- like his fellow Americans, Bae and Miller -- was detained in North Korea.
"I got there, and they said I was the only one coming home."
"Kenneth Bae and Matthew Miller should have been released before I was," Fowle told CNN.
"But that's what, I'm sure, they want to probably have, (to) just come back to regular, mundane days."
A devout Christian, Bae was in Rason, an area along the northeastern coast of North Korea, when authorities arrested him in November 2012.
While also accused of "perpetrating hostile acts," and while he -- like Bae and Miller -- told CNN he signed documents admitting his guilt, Fowle said he didn't spend time in a jail or at a labor camp.
"Being isolated in a foreign country is very difficult," she said.
That would seem impossible for Bae, who's been gone longer and whose business was predicated on traveling to North Korea, as Fowle fully admits.
