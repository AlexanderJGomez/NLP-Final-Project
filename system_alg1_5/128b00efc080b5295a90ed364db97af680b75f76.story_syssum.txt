If there ever was a poster boy for capital punishment, legal analysts say, the 25-year-old Holmes would fit the bill.
In addition, more and more states are abolishing the death penalty.
But even if Holmes is sentenced to death, there are no guarantees.
And that, said David Beller, a defense attorney not associated with the case, can make the prosecution's decision to seek the death penalty more complicated.
"Not only improper, but grossly improper," prosecutors said in a Thursday court filing.
"Prior to arraignment, Mr. Holmes made an offer to the prosecution to resolve this case by pleading guilty and spending the rest of his life in prison, without any opportunity for parole," the documents filed by the defense team read.
The question is what punishment he will get," said CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin.
Holmes' trial date has been set for February 3.
