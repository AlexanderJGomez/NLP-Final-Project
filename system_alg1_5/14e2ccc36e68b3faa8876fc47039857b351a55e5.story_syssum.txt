"The guys who actually made this assassination attempt, they were two young boys," Rehman Malik said.
"They had seen the vehicle of Malala going up and down, and accordingly they acted on that."
He said police had offered to protect Malala three times before the incident, but her father had refused.
But he added, "I assure to the world community that when she goes back, we do have the ability to protect her."
Malik said she and her parents can stay in the UK as long as needed, "until she is fully rehabilitated."
