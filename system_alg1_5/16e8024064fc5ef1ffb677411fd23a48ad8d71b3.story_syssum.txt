Dating in the digital era can be a rocky road, but in the forthcoming airing of "Inside Man," Morgan Spurlock looks to redefine the road trip.
And this affects who is drawn to whom," shares Spurlock.
Instead of texting, try talking, and actually engaging.
As a part of Thursday's episode, Spurlock checks in with a professional "wingman," several professional matchmaking services and multiple profile coaches, all of which boast an ability to keep daters on track.
"When we find a great match, then we set you up on a date."
As the "Inside Man" explores individual landmarks this week, one constant theme remains: stay awake, and keep on coming.
And whether it's virtually online, through "OKCupid," or literally on line, like in a local watering hole, the secret to success is keeping one's foot on the proverbial pedal.
"I had a real connection."
