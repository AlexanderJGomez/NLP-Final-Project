Her family's tragedy started on November 22 1986, when her father, Jose Martinez, had an altercation with a few customers at a restaurant he owned with his wife.
"Reading the paper for him in Spanish," Joselyn said of her favorite memories of her father.
"They should not have closed the case," NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly said Tuesday.
"You let it go, but not really," she said.
"I said well, I put that in there," she said about never finding her father's killer.
"My family told me, don't ever forget that name," she said.
And in January, she went back to the police chief at the precinct and presented her case.
"It took a team effort," Martinez said.
"I am thankful to God and to my daughter for never resting and didn't care for how many years," she said.
