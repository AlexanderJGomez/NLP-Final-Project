When Hamilton flicked down his visor, revved the Mercedes' engine and hit the throttle, a global surge of support roared.
In Brazil, self-styled Melissa "Hamilton," who is married to Alex "Senna," also used the hashtag to communicate with her idol.
"I always say we win and lose together," he smiled.
"He has a very strong following.
"We saw that Lewis' fans were talking to one another and so we came up with the protocol #TeamLH," explains Roope.
"His fanbase is enormously international," he said.
Here it is.
Hamilton himself explained the concept, and the emotional response it generated within him, after the race.
"It was important to us personally," Thomas said.
"It's a global base and we are trying to make it bigger.
Right now, we use #LewisNation to meet up at races but we've started work on a website."
"There's a crossover that appeals to many, many backgrounds," said Thomas.
He invites a whole new set of people into F1, people who might be put off by the rich, white, middle-classness of it all."
"Lewis is a fighter, he faced many prejudices and difficult days but he never gave up on his dream; he teaches us that," Melissa explained.
"In addition to his talent as a wonderful driver, he has a big heart, a great willpower.
Thomas, like Melissa, has met Hamilton "tonnes of times" in and around grand prix weekends.
"The first person we invited verbally to our wedding was Lewis," Thomas explained.
"Lewis is genuinely indebted to his fans," said Roope.
When he drives out of the garage in Australia, the world champion may be racing to end the season as No.1 but he also carries the hearts and hopes of millions.
