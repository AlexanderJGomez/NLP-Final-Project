Bennett, who is also the party's treasurer, was pulled from an aircraft at the airport in Zimbabwe's capital, Harare, the MDC said.
Bennett, a white coffee grower, is an old foe of Mugabe's government.
The swearing-in eventually took place but was delayed, the MDC said, because Mugabe and his ZANU-PF party wanted to appoint more ministers than they were allowed in the new government.
The stalemate lasted for more than an hour, until Mugabe's party agreed that only 17 of their proposed ministers take office.
