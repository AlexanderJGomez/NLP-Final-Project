"Iran was beautiful," Sheppard said.
What he saw was the generosity of the people -- they treated him to dinners, took him on tours of historic landmarks and welcomed him, a non-Muslim from the West, into their homes.
"Sometimes you have to go out there and see it for yourself," the 32-year-old said.
"They brought me in as a brother," Sheppard explains.
"I brought a sense of belief to them," Sheppard recalled.
By this time, American filmmaker Till Schauder, intrigued with Sheppard's Iranian adventure, had begun shooting a documentary of his success with the team and how he was adapting to life in a faraway land.
"I was like, man, I ain't gonna do this."
It was so sad."
"Through sports we wanted to get into a society that is often misrepresented and misunderstood," Schauder said.
"I mailed 80 tapes and kept the 10 I felt had the biggest nuggets with myself," Schauder says.
Schauder, who had been denied a journalist's visa, freely traveled in and out of the country before his last planned trip near the end of the basketball season.
"I could see it on my teammates' faces," he said.
While still interested in visiting his friends back in Iran, he admits that might be difficult.
