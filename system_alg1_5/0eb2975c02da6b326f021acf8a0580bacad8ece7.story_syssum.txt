"Russia and other countries should not view the European integration of their neighbors as a zero-sum game," Kerry said.
"In fact, the lesson of the last half-century is that we can accomplish much more when the United States, Russia and Europe work together.
"Whatever the geopolitics, we have offered Ukraine a closer association with the European Union, the countries to its west.
The future of Ukraine belongs with the European Union."
"What does incitement of increasingly violent street protests have to do with promoting democracy," he asked.

"We are deeply concerned by increasing reports of protesters disappearing and being beaten and tortured, as well as by attacks on journalists," Carney said.
Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, is home to 45 million people.
