But wait!
If you drive a 20-mpg vehicle 15,000 miles a year, that's an extra $180, each year, toward those extra few octane points.
Alan Hall, a spokesman for Ford, says that the automaker no longer has any models that require premium grade and only a few for which it's recommended.
Regular unleaded is fine across all the models of Ford's Lincoln  luxury brand, says Hall, so "as a luxury car buyer you don't have that added premium of premium fuel."
For the record, there's no measurable difference in fuel economy between the two grades, or any greater potential for damage, according to Hyundai.
The best way to tell, advises John Nielsen, director of AAA's Auto Repair and Buying Network, is to simply look at the inside of the fuel door; if it says, "use premium fuel only," and specifies a higher octane number (regular is typically 87, premium is 91 or higher), then the expensive stuff is actually required for the vehicle.
To call a fuel regular, midgrade, or premium, Searles explains, only relates to octane; there's no other requirement that assures greater purity, more detergents, or better additives.
But since the 1980s, most vehicles have had knock sensors.
"Higher-octane gasoline doesn't make any more power, but it enables higher compression, or enables the turbochargers to produce more boost," says Nielsen.
"There could be some short-term knocking or pinging, but nothing lasting," he says.
In a lot of cases, Nielsen sums, the fuel specs are simply an engineering issue; the engine was designed and tested with premium fuel, and they didn't design it to run on premium -- although it might do just fine.
