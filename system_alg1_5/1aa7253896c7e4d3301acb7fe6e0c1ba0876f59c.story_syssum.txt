In extra preparation for his tilt at a 15th major at Lytham, Woods has added the Greenbrier Classic, which starts Thursday, to his schedule.

"Yesterday was a silent day, but I think everyone saved it up for today," said Woods, who had the added pressure of being the tournament host in Maryland.
So I'd say that he's playing the best golf in the world right now."
