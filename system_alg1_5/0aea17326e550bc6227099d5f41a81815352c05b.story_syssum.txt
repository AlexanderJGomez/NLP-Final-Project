It would make any driver stand out in a traffic jam, and it's completely road legal.
"Any place that uses robotics today, you could use materials and have the same capabilities," says Skylar Tibbits, a computational architect who leads the Lab and the movement.
Trying to find more elegant solutions seems an obvious target, and what we're proposing is a single material with the same actuation capability, the same sensing, the same range of movement, if not more."
"More materials, more energy sources," Tibbits says are the current priorities.
In addition to BAC, the team are collaborating with Airbus to develop the wing design.
Demand for 4D is reaching a fever pitch, says Dr. Junus Kahn, founder of Carbitex, which produces the materials used by the Self-Assembly Lab, as well as supplying them to major business clients.
"Everyone is always scared that technology will take our jobs," says Tibbits, rolling his eyes.
But we should be afraid of people not technology, we shouldn't stop inventing."
