In Cuba, he was called "The Godfather."
His deeply wrinkled face smiled out from billboards, T-shirts and boxes of Vegas Robaina cigars, among Cuba's finest.
"I had a very strong conversation with Fidel 18 or 20 years ago," Robaina said in 2008.
"I like to sow during a waxing moon, and harvest in a waning moon," he said.
In 1997, Cuba launched the Vegas Robaina brand, named in his honor.
"Of course I have hope they'll open up the market," he said.
Robaina will be buried Sunday, said Candia.
