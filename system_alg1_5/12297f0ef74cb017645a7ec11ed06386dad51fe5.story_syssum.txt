One of America's most beloved comedies, 1959's zany "Some Like It Hot," starring Marilyn Monroe and drag-bedecked Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, used the Hotel del Coronado as a main location.
Over its long history, the Victorian hotel, noted for its wraparound porches (highlighted in the film where rows of men wait to watch for Monroe's character, Sugar, to return to the hotel), has been the site of many films, including 1915's "Pearl of the Pacific" and 1924's "My Husband's Wives."
It turns out the hotel is haunted, driving the father (Nicholson's character, Jack Torrance) insane.

The 1928 Italian Renaissance style hotel, now part of the Four Seasons, has a big role in 1990's "Pretty Woman," starring Richard Gere as a ruthless businessman and Julia Roberts as a prostitute who softens his heart.

As a neutral country during World War II, Portugal played host to spies, deposed royalty, black marketers and many others who came to stay at the hotel and play in the casino on the Estoril Coast outside Lisbon.
