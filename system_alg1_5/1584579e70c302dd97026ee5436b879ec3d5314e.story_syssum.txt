"This is the worst basketball that I've seen this season," says Doyle, while exiting the O2 Arena after the Knicks were blown out by the Milwaukee Bucks for their 16th loss in a row.
"I was hoping they would win close to 40 games, sneak into the playoffs and see what could happen," he says.
For Doyle, however, supporting the Knicks is practically out of his hands.
"I ended up choosing the team most like the Knicks," Doyle explains.
"It's a tough season, so we really appreciate his effort of trying to see all of our games," says Pablo Prigioni, the Knicks Argentinian point guard and Doyle's favorite current player.
"It's a crazy amount of money, I understand that," he says, between sips of Guinness at an oak-infused pub in Notting Hill, west London.
A great fan of Nick Hornsby's "Fever Pitch," he intends to write a memoir about the Knicks' season in the same vein, minus the trophy ending.
"Right away there is a certain interest, a morbid curiosity."
"At a certain point, it's like watching a small animal get tortured and there's no reason to continue to subject myself to that kind of pain," he says.
"That's a lot more hardcore than I am," says Ziad Al-Essa, a 35-year-old Milwaukee Bucks faithful, who flew in from Kuwait and spent $750 on a floor seat to see the London game.
"I miss watching it on TV," he says.
