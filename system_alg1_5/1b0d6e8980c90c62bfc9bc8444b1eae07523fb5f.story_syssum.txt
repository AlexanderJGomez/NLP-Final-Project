He said he saw an official convoy after sunset Tuesday, and said it was "possible" Gadhafi was inside.
Professor Abubaker Saad, a former Gadhafi aide, on Tuesday described to CNN a system of bunkers under the Gadhafi compound in Tripoli that could serve as a hideout.
"The quality of the audio has deteriorated, and that's an indication that he is speaking from a distance," Saad said.
U.S. officials called for Gadhafi to make clear that, regardless of where he may be, he knows he's out as the nation's leader.
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of not being identified, said Gadhafi is most likely still in Tripoli.
In 2009, Chavez was one of three world leaders to attend a lavish celebration of Gadhafi's 40 years of rule in Tripoli, along with Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and King Abdullah of Jordan.
On Tuesday, Chavez said his country would only recognize a Libyan government led by Gadhafi, state media reported.
However, Gadhafi's relationship with Saudi Arabia has cooled since the Saudis accused Libyans of trying to kill their king several years ago, and it would be unlikely for the desert kingdom to accept an exiled Gadhafi now, according to Christopher Boucek, a Saudi Arabia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
