"She is really going to need all of us to step up, step in, be involved, fight for her, be a voice for her."
Tanden, who has worked with Clinton since 1997, is very close with the former first lady.
"When you are making decisions, whether you are secretary of state, or senator, first lady, or future president, it matters who is at that table," Tanden said at the event.
Politico, on the other hand, reported that Tanden was "likely to play an informal role if she [Clinton] runs."
