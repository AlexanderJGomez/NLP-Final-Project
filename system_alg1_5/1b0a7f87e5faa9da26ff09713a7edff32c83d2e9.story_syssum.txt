China is steadily catching up in space.
If all goes as planned, China will become only the third nation, next to the U.S. and Russia, to dock capsules in space.
"China also plans to establish its own space lab around 2016 and assemble a 60-ton manned space station around 2020, when the current International Space Station is estimated to likely retire."
China's space program has become a campaign issue in the United States.
"For comparative purposes, it's about where the U.S. was during the Gemini program."
China has developed its own spaceship, the Shenzhou, or Divine Vessel, which observers say resembles Russia's Soyuz space capsule.
Before that, China's space program was largely seen as capable but lacking in sophistication.
There was palpable anxiety before the launch.
China also looks to harness aerospace technology for trickle-down spinoffs in telecommunications, weather forecasting, agriculture, medicine and navigation.
Such a station, a la ISS, will enable China to conduct scientific and military research.
Still, experts say, the U.S. remains concerned about Chinese space activities.
If the trajectory remains unchanged, experts say, China's space activities may well surpass those of Russia and the European Space Agency within a decade or so.
