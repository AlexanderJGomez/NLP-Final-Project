A candidate's every word can now be captured by modern technology and live in e-perpetuity.
He needs to gracefully pivot.
Romney desperately needs to improve his numbers with Latinos.
Unless Romney gets close to 40% of the Latino vote, he can kiss the White House goodbye.
Still, immigration does set a tone.
However, all's not lost.
Hispanics are disillusioned with Obama.
If Romney can neutralize the immigration issue by moderating his tone, giving more nuanced answers and taking the offensive against Obama, then he can focus on other issues.
If he expects to make up the lost ground, Hispanics cannot be an afterthought.
Romney needs to do the same, pronto, and he needs to make it count by delivering memorable speeches.
Come Election Day, I don't know whether Romney is going to do better with Hispanics than the polls indicate or if Obama is going to do worse.
