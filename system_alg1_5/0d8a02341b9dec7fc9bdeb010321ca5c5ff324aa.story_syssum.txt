Jay-Z spoke with Oprah Winfrey about his father, his anger and his old life.
Jay-Z: Anger.
Oprah: Wow.
Jay-Z: We were told our parents would separate, but the reasons weren't explained.
Jay-Z: Yeah.
I remember telling her, "Don't worry, when I get big, I'm going to take care of this."
And stronger.
Jay-Z: About 16.
Jay-Z: My mom set up a meeting.
Jay-Z: And I guess from that point, she figured out what was wrong with me, and she planned a meeting between me and my father.
Jay-Z: I never looked at that.
Jay-Z: I believed that.
Jay-Z: He showed up.
He was saying stuff like "Man, you knew where I was."
Jay-Z: When I was 9, my dad's brother got stabbed, and my dad went looking for the guy who did it.
After a while, my mom was like, "Hey, this is your family now.
Jay-Z: He was broken.
Jay-Z: Pretty much.
Jay-Z: Absolutely.
That's true.
Jay-Z: As a kid, I didn't know any better.
Jay-Z: All the time.
