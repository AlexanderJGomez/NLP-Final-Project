Miami, Florida (CNN) -- A Miami, Florida, court appearance for Colton Harris-Moore, the so-called "barefoot bandit," has been postponed until Friday, as he did not have a U.S.-based attorney to represent him Wednesday.
The Southern District of Florida, in Miami, is the closest jurisdiction to the Bahamas, said Langlie.
The complaint, which was sealed until last week, was filed last December and stems from his allegedly stealing a plane in Bonner's Ferry, Idaho, and crashing it outside Granite Falls, Washington, she said.
"He seems to be very remorseful," attorney Monique Gomez, a Bahamian lawyer who represented Harris-Moore in Nassau,  told CNN in a telephone interview.
The teen had been on the run since he escaped from a juvenile halfway house in Renton, Washington, in 2008.
