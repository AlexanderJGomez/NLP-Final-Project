But a majority of Americans, 61%-38%, oppose placing U.S. soldiers on the ground in Iraq and Syria to combat the terrorist group.
While the CNN poll indicates Americans think ISIS has the ability to attack the United States, Obama said in the NBC interview there has been no "immediate intelligence" that signifies the terrorist group is a threat.
So far, Americans are not happy with how Obama has addressed the ISIS situation.
The CNN/ORC Polls shows that 45% of Americans see that ISIS is a "very serious threat to the U.S," while 49% thought the same of al Qaeda 11 years ago.
"Americans are significantly less reluctant to use military force than they were a year ago, and the number who say that terrorism is the country's most important problem has quadrupled, making it second only to the economy on the list of top problems in the public's mind," CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said.
