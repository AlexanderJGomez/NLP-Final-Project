Many observers believe Saverin, who, according to the Facebook origin story was slighted by Zuckerberg as the site grew, was a primary source for the book "The Accidental Billionaires," on which "Social Network" is based.
"That's Hollywood, not a documentary," the 30-year-old Saverin says in the interview conducted in his multimillion-dollar residence in Singapore.
He says that's not the case and noted that, as has been reported, he's paying his taxes.
Saverin's father, Roberto, echoed those thoughts in the article.
"It was hard for me, because of the life I built in the U.S., hearing from Eduardo that he had to give up on his citizenship," he said.
"I don't like showing my private life online," he said.
