On Sunday, dry ice in a plastic bottle exploded in an employee restroom, causing a brief shutdown of Terminal 2, the FBI said.
Three plastic bottles containing dry ice were found, but only one had exploded, police said.
"His intent in taking the dry ice from the hold was not the intent to make a destructive device," Wasserman said.
When dry ice becomes warm, it transforms into vapor.
