"We're still very much in the middle of a major storm," said Daphne Hart, a Red Cross spokeswoman.
"And as soon as it's safe to do so, those vehicles as well as disaster assessment teams will be canvassing the area, trying to determine what the needs are.
"Once the storm passes, folks are going to need to get back into their homes.
"During that time, the Salvation Army mobile kitchens will continue to roll out.
