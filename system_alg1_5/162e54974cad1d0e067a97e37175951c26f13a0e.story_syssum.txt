CNN's Kyra Phillips asked Fallon about his resignation and about U.S. policy regarding Iraq and Iran.
Fallon: The story is -- the facts are that the situation was one that was very uncomfortable for me and, I'm sure, for the president.
Fallon: What was important was not me.
That's the motivation.
The situation with Iran is very complex.
Fallon: It's not my position to negotiate with Iran.
Again, don't believe for a second that the president really wants to go to war with Iran.
Fallon: No, I don't believe so at all.
She would have a few things to say.
That's what I went about doing.
John McCain says, no, we've got to stay the course.
There's a very, very important military role here in providing stability and security in this country, but that's not going to be successful, as we know, without lots of other people playing a hand.
They want to have stability.
We all want to bring our troops home.
Given where we are today, the progress that they've made particularly in the last couple months, I think it's very, very heartening to see what's really happened here.
