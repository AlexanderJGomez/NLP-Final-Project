So far, the virus has sickened 24,934 children on the Chinese mainland, authorities said.
The deaths are blamed on enterovirus 71, or EV-71, one of the most common causes of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD).
In mild cases, EV-71 causes cold-like symptoms, diarrhea, and sores on the hands, feet and mouth.
Taiwan had a large outbreak of HFMD in 1998 with 78 deaths, and smaller outbreaks in 2000 and 2001, according to the CDC.
