"He was great.
It's one of the reasons why I started to play," he said Wednesday.
"To play with Victor and see him shoot a course record and play fantastic golf, I learned so much about the game from the two guys," he said.
"It's the first event for me and also in Ukraine so it's big for golf here," he said.
