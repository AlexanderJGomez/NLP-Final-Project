"None of us in this business can tolerate any of this," Babbitt said of the sleeping controllers.
This "will not be tolerated," he insisted.
"It's a very big concern," Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said Monday.
But it's up to the controllers "to take personal responsibility" and get adequate rest during their down time, he said.
Last week, the head of the FAA Air Traffic Organization, Hank Krakowski, resigned over the uproar caused by the recent spate of incidents.
In at least one incident, the FAA has said, the controller deliberately went to sleep, while some of the others appear to have been accidental.
