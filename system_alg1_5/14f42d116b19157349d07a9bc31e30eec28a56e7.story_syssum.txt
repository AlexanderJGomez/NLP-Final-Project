"On this course, nothing is going to be easy -- it will take work, hard work," Papandreou said in his victory address.
Karamanlis called the elections in response to pressure from Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement of Greece, which threatened to block the election of a president in February if no general election was held.
Karamanlis, of the New Democracy party, congratulated Papandreou in a nationally televised concession speech.
The Socialist party will receive an estimated 160 seats in Greece's 300-seat Parliament, officials said, compared with New Democracy's 93 seats.
However, Papandreou's stimulus plan is also under scrutiny, with critics wanting to know more details, such as how it would be funded.
"Tackling the problem, these endemic problems, really requires major efforts to reform public administration to tackle corruption and to change the culture of expectations," he said.
