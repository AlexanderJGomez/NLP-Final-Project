Through various evolutions, the ATP World Tour Finals is now a $5 million tournament that crowns a grueling, long year.
Group A: Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, David Ferrer, Tomas Berdych.
Group B: Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Mardy Fish.
Roger Federer: The Swiss maestro has been unable to add to his record tally of 16 grand slam titles in 2011, losing in the French Open final after ending Djokovic's winning run in the semis.
David Ferrer: The world No.
He has reached sixth ATP finals this year, including Masters 1000 tournaments in Monte Carlo and Shanghai, winning titles in Auckland and Acapulco.
The more prestigious the event, the more points at stake.
The top seven players in the rankings are automatic qualifiers, and the eighth spot is reserved for any grand slam winner not in those places -- a rare occurrence, unless injury strikes.
The players are divided into two groups of four and play each other once in a round-robin format, before the top two in each pool advance to the semifinals.
"Roger's been playing well, especially the last couple of weeks, so I think he has a terrific chance," Annacone, who also worked with 14-time grand slam winner Sampras, told CNN.
A rival tournament, the WCT Finals, was run by the World Championship Tennis Tour and continued to exist in tandem until 1989.
The doubles event, which used to take place at a different venue, has been staged in tandem with the singles since Houston in 2003.
