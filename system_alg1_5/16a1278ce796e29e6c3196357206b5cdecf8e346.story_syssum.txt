(CNN) -- Writer and producer Larry Gelbart, most known for his work on the hit television series "M*A*S*H," died Friday morning in his Beverly Hills, California, home, his wife said.
"So when I got my chance, that's what I did."
Not just because it got there first, but because it got there first with so much," Gelbart said.
In 1972, Gelbart helped create the Korean War comedy drama "M*A*S*H." The show went on for another 11 years, although Gelbart only wrote and produced "M*A*S*H" for the first four seasons.
For Gelbart, "M*A*S*H" mixed a bit of comedy with drama, allowing viewers to connect more with the story.
Gelbart continued steamrolling through the industry, with works including the 1982 hit film "Tootsie," "Oh, God!"
