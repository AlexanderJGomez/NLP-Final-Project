"Iran will use all its capabilities, including the relevant international agencies, to follow up on this case," Maj. Gen. Ahmad Vahidi said Friday, according to Iran's semi-official news agency ISNA.
The drone was not hit, and it returned under its own power to its base, he said.
"Our aircraft was never in Iranian airspace.
Two of the officials said the fighter jets belonged to Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps force, which has been more confrontational than regular Iranian military forces.
The drone's still and video cameras captured the incident, showing the two Su-25s approaching and firing their onboard guns, the officials said.
"The armed forces will respond decisively to any act of transgression," he said, according to the semi-official Fars News Agency.
