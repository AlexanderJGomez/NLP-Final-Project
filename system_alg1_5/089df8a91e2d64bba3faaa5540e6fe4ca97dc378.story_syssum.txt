It's a phrase coined by South African marketing agency The Creative Counsel, describing individuals who live, breathe and promote a brand in specific zones of South Africa.
This is marketing turned upside down, but it works in Africa.
Gil Oved, co-founder and co-CEO of The Creative Council, says: "Multinational brands are coming from all over the world and they want in on Africa as is obvious, and agencies like ours are helping them engage a consumer in a new, inventive way, which is actually a very old traditional way.
This marketing strategy works in Africa because, as Ran Neu-Ner, co-founder and co-CEO of The Creative Counsel explains, African consumers "will use something a friend has recommended or a sister or a brother or a parent or any relative has recommended.
Vodacom is one of The Creative Counsel's clients; it too utilizes zonal champions to spread its marketing message to consumers who are hard to reach.
"Zonal champions aren't like normal promoters, they don't usually have working hours ... when you live and breathe a brand and you're passionate about it, you do it 24/7, 365," says Oved.
But it's about more than selling products.
Oved explains: "There's a wonderful Zulu idiom, it goes, 'Isandla siya kezane,' which means one hand washes the other.
