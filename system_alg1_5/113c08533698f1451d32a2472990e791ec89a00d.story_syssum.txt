Both congressmen are Republican.
Rep. Jeff Denham, who represents California's 10th Congressional District, is actively lobbying his Republican colleagues to get on board behind immigration legislation that includes a path to legalization.
His congressional neighbor and fellow Republican, Rep. Tom McClintock, couldn't disagree more.
It's a controversial position within Republican circles.
Meanwhile, conservatives know what's popular with the base -- and in their district.
McClintock represents a predominately Republican district, which overwhelmingly voted for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in the 2012 election.
"There aren't that many districts like that in California," Lai said of the profile of McClintock's district, which allows him to have a conservative, anti-immigration position.
McClintock and Denham "reflect the complex topography of California, but at the same time, their positions are reflected in their constituents," Lai said.
But in a deeply divided Congress, with more than 200 safe Republicans, immigration is hardly worth upsetting the base.
Rosemary Jenks, executive director of Numbers USA, a group that favors a reduction of immigration, said McClintock is more in line with Republican voters' views.
Michael Ayala, CEO of the Tuolomne County Chamber, located in California's 4th District, says immigration isn't a priority for county residents.
"If the federal government would enforce existing law, we wouldn't have the problems we currently have," Ayala said, a position that McClintock echoes.
It's just unclear what it will be.
