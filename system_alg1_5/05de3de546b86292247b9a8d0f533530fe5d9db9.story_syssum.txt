A former member of FIFA's ethics committee, Les Murray, says a member of the world governing body's executive committee asked a member of the Australian bid team for the 2022 World Cup for a kickback in exchange for a vote.
Murray, who also works with Australian broadcaster SBS, went on: "I was on the FIFA ethics committee at the time.
"So that's an impasse that should be sorted," said Murray, who was a member of the Ethics Committee between 2003 and 2013, and as of July 2012 a member of the Investigatory Chamber, according to FIFA, before he left the organization just over a year aog.
"In my opinion it should be published, of course," added the Australian.
"The only possible explanation for Qatar winning that World Cup bid, in my view, is because there was some funny business going on, and with that being the case and there being no other explanation, this story is not going to go away," said Murray.
"I think FIFA made a big mistake in awarding Qatar the World Cup for many reasons," he said.
"A new sponsorship law, currently under review, that will replace the outdated "kafala" system will be announced by next year," said the statement.
Significant changes such as these take more time to implement that some may wish, but we intend to effect meaningful and lasting change for the benefit of all those who live and work in Qatar.
