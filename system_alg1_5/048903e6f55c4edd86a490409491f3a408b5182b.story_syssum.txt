One other such leader -- U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder -- spent Wednesday in and around Ferguson, Missouri, talking with residents, leaders and the man charged with maintaining security in the city after nearly two weeks of unrest.

"We're not going to rush it through, and we're not going to leave anything out," he said.
"I think the people expect to see something by now," he said.
This prompted a handful of protesters to toss more bottles, glass and plastic.

Others, wearing T-shirts printed with the word "peacekeeper," tried to defuse tensions.
"You're there to protect people," Honore added.
"We are starting here a good dialogue, but the reality is the dialogue is not enough," he said.
