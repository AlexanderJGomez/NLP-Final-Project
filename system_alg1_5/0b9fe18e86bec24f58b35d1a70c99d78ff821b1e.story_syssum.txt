LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Jay Leno says immediacy is key to his new show, and he should have plenty of it for his prime time premiere Monday, when Kanye West is a musical guest.
Leno's publicist confirmed Monday that West was still booked for the NBC show, which tapes just three hours before it airs in the eastern United States at 10 p.m.
"I remember being 17 years old, up for my first MTV award with Destiny's Child, and it was one of the most exciting moments of my life," she said, referring to the girl group with which she had her start.
"I'm sooooo sorry to Taylor Swift and her fans and her mom," the message said in all caps.
When Grant told Leno "I did a bad thing," it gave Leno's "Tonight Show" a viewership bump that has been credited with solidifying his lead over rival David Letterman in the late-night ratings war.
West, Rihanna and Jay-Z will debut Leno's new approach to musical guests.
Jerry Seinfeld will also appear on Leno's premiere Monday.
