"Collectively, nothing could be more important than this question of energy," Carter said during a rare presidential appearance before a congressional committee.
Congressional attention to the issue is being driven by President Obama, who, like Carter, has placed energy near the top of his domestic agenda.
But after "a long period of energy complacency," he said, daily imports to the United States are now almost 13 million barrels.
"Although our rich nation can afford these daily purchases, there is little doubt that, in general terms, we are constrained not to alienate our major oil suppliers, which puts a restraint on our nation's foreign policy," Carter said.
Unfortunately, Kerry added, the "political will to take decisive action has dissipated" as each past energy crisis has subsided.
