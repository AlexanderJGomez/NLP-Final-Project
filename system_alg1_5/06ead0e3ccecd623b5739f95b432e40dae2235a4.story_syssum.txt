Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Attackers in Pakistan have hit another convoy carrying fuel for NATO troops in Afghanistan, killing one person, authorities said.
"U.S. and NATO forces are killing innocent Pakistanis, which is unacceptable, and we will teach them a lesson by such attacks," Tariq said.
The Pakistani Taliban said a special squad has been appointed to hit U.S. interests in Pakistan, especially NATO supply efforts.
On Monday, NATO's secretary general said an investigation has been launched into the incident.
Obviously, it was unintended.
The route is most important for fuel transport but said even if the gate remained closed for a while, the ability to supply fuel to troops in Afghanistan would not be affected, he said.
