When he was unable to win back his job, murder became, as a manifesto attributed to Dorner put it, "a necessary evil" for him to prevail in the face of racism and injustice.
Rather, mass murderers act methodically and with purpose.
Although bitter, resentful and full of despair, they see others, often the former boss or supervisor, as the people who are to blame for their miserable existence.
When he is deprived of his financial security, sense of purpose and dignity, the idea of getting even becomes all consuming.
Particularly frightening in the ongoing L.A. drama, of course, is the marksmanship skills that Dorner undoubtedly acquired through his careers with the Navy and in law enforcement, giving added significance to the phrase, "armed and dangerous."
If he is like most mass murderers, it is not the spotlight that he is enjoying, but the satisfaction of payback.
