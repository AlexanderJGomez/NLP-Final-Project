(CNN) -- "Saturday Night Live" writer-performer Seth Meyers will take over NBC's "Late Night" show next year when current host Jimmy Fallon moves to "The Tonight Show," NBC announced Sunday.
NBC announced in April that "Tonight" would relocate back to New York from Burbank, California.
Like Fallon before him, Meyers anchored SNL's "Weekend Update" desk.
The NBC announcement did not say when Meyers would leave his SNL duties.
