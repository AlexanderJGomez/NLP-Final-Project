Not so at Hodgkins Elementary in Westminster, Colorado, where there are no grades and no grade levels.
"He's the highest in the class," said Dulce, who is proud of her friend's achievements.
"Every single student is getting an individualized education," said Hodgkins Principal Sarah Gould, who helped usher in the reform at her school two years ago.
"The kids know exactly what they're working on ... and what they need to do, so it's very empowering for them," she said.
"The time is right for a system that focuses on individual students and lets them progress at their own pace," said education researcher Robert Marzano, who is helping the district develop standards-based learning, a system that was first introduced in the 1960s.
In the last decade, as demographics began to change, standardized test scores fell, leading the district to be placed on an academic watch list.
That's just not going to happen," she said.
The organization's executive director, Wendy Battino, said that in order for standards-based learning to work, schools must have strong leadership and shared vision.
Of the approximately 300 schools that have attempted to enact this system, Battino said, half haven't been able to stick with it.
So far, they haven't.
Discipline problems, Gould said, have decreased 76% in the past two years -- a sign, she said, that the system is working.
