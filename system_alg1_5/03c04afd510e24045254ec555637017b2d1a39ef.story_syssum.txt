(CNN) -- Hundreds of people were injured in Bahrain Friday, when rival groups clashed over an attempted march in the town of Riffa, a residential area where the ruling Al-Khalifa family lives.
The conflict began when small groups from opposing sides met at the security fence, she said.
Video footage would support his version of the operation, she said.
Riffa is just over 12 miles (20 kilometers) southwest of the capital, Manama, where demonstrators have been protesting in Pearl Roundabout for a month.
It accused the government of torturing some human rights activists.
