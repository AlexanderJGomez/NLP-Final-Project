I know, because I'm a child of Alzheimer's.
That's right.
Alzheimer's is a disease that kills.
Alzheimer's is exerting a powerful impact on American families -- on our health, our finances, and our futures.
Back in 2010, when we published "The Shriver Report: A Woman's Nation Takes on Alzheimer's," we reported that women were more than half the individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's and nearly two-thirds of the unpaid caregivers of those who had it.
So, in partnership with the Alzheimer's Association and so many inspiring women already working on the front lines to fight this disease, we have launched the Wipe Out Alzheimer's Challenge, a multipronged campaign powered by women's brains.
Why is the incidence of Alzheimer's higher for women?
Is there an Alzheimer's connection with depression or with diabetes?
Yet, as the Alzheimer's Association tells us, "the costs to all payers for the care of people living with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias will total an estimated $226 billion, with Medicare and Medicaid paying 68 percent of the costs."
So Wipe Out Alzheimer's is stepping in.
What's the difference between normal forgetfulness, dementia and Alzheimer's disease?
It's time for the narrative around Alzheimer's to change.
We want to do the same with Alzheimer's.
The race for the Oscar may be over, but the race to wipe out Alzheimer's is on.
