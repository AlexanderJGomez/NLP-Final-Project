Gonzalo Ferre Molto, president of state-owned rail infrastructure company Adif, and Julio Gomez-Pomar, president of state railroad company Renfe, outlined what is being done to ensure the safety of rail travelers.
That section of track had been inspected on April 20, he said.
After the accident, a temporary speed limit of 30 kph was imposed on the stretch where the accident occurred and is still in place, Ferre said.
In total, more than 7,000 trains have passed through the stretch where the accident occurred, Gomez-Pomar said.
If it is really so, we are lost.
This argument falls by its own weight," said Gaspar Llamazares, of the United Left group.
Minutes before the derailment, Garzon received a call on his work phone, apparently receiving instructions on the way to Ferrol from a Renfe staff member, a court in Galicia said last month.
