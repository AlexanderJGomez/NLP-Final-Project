In a two-month span, six people have been killed in the operation, including possibly four innocent civilians.
As of Wednesday, authorities said, they had interdicted five planes, seized about 2,300 kilos of cocaine, and made seven arrests.
On June 23, a DEA agent shot and killed a suspected trafficker after he reached for a weapon, the agency said.
"There is no clear oversight from Congress over what is going on," she said.
Anvil's major innovation is the use of military outposts closer to the drug trafficking routes, known as forward operating locations, for quicker deployment by Honduran police and their DEA advisers.
"This concept is new, but previously there's been these type of bi-national efforts done by the Honduran government and DEA," he said.
Operation Anvil seeks to track planes entering Honduras, ascertains where they will land, and then sends helicopters out to make arrests, Posivak said.
"It's not a problem that can be solved by law enforcement alone," he said.
DEA agents were present, but did not fire their weapons, officials say.
For us who gain no benefit, these costs are unacceptable," Pastor said.
Hernandez, the Honduran ambassador, counters that Operation Anvil and other programs are not military operations, but law enforcement ones.
But the Honduran government is weak, its institutions and police suffer from corruption, and public opinion favors security on the streets more than security in remote parts of the country, Ungar said.
"We believe these interdictions have had a strong impact," he said.
