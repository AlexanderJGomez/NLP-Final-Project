(Tribune Media Services) -- Europe is investing in its infrastructure, and travelers know the results are breathtaking.
The actual tunnel crossing is a 20-minute, black, silent, 100-mile-per-hour nonevent.
In January, Eurostar's monopoly on using the Chunnel -- the tunnel beneath the English Channel -- expires.
The competition can only be good for travelers, but for now, you'll have to use Eurostar.
When you're ready to ride, you'll find the process is similar to an airport check-in -- without all the drama, sole-baring shoe inspections, and waiting.
There are a few shops, newsstands, snack bars, and cafes (I usually bring better, cheaper food for the trip from elsewhere), pay-Internet terminals, and a currency-exchange booth with rates about the same as you'll find on the other end.
Once the digging started, crews crept forward 100 feet a day until June 1991, when French and English workers broke through and shook hands midway across the Channel.
High-tech know-how, a shared European vision, and people's love of travel have created incredibly fast trains that crisscross, link and strengthen Europe.
