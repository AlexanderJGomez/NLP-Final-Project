In reality, of course, to create the startlingly elaborate sculptural portraits Mapes is known for, he has to be much more organized than that.
Technically, Mapes is a portraitist, though he rarely uses paint.
Typically, this is a fairly simple process with Mapes gathering his photos, bits of hair, and handwriting samples from his living subject's home and then organizing them into a portrait using test tubes, little baggies or pushpins.
"In this way, I can work more intuitively in the composition, again, with the spirit of a painterâ€”in a lab coat, so to speak."
Of course, Mapes' final portrait is going to look a lot like the original, only with a much more of an artistically rendered shrine vibe.
"These subjects were surely well known to the artists who painted them," says Mapes.
"My hope," he says.
