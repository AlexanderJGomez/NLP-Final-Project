Crimea, a Black Sea peninsula with an ethnic Russian majority, is the last big bastion of opposition to the new political leadership in the capital, Kiev, after President Viktor Yanukovych's ouster Saturday.
According to RIA Novosti, anonymous government sources said Thursday that Yanukovych was in Russia and that Russian authorities have accepted his request for security.
He said Mohyliov would respect the parliament's decision, despite many procedural irregularities.
Back in Kiev, lawmakers approved opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk of the Batkivshchyna, or Fatherland, party as Prime Minister.
"The key task for the Ukrainian government is European integration," he said.
The future of Ukraine is in Europe, and Ukraine will become a member of the European Union."
"I'm closely watching Russia's military exercises along the Ukrainian border," he said.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, offered reassurances Thursday that military exercises were previously scheduled and not related to Ukraine.
The men, who stormed the building early Thursday, had made no demands, and it was not clear what they wanted, he said.
We only saw the building being taken over," he said.
