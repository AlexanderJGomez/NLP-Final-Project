Anja Wolz, emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, spoke to CNN on Tuesday from an Ebola facility in Kailahun, Sierra Leone.
The source of his infection is unknown, but Ebola cannot be ruled out, the ministry said.
Eight other people are being quarantined and three are awaiting Ebola test results, the health minister said.
Meanwhile, the World Health Organization reports an outbreak of the virus in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria is believed to have infected 1,603 people and killed more than 887 this year, as of Friday.
A second American patient, Nancy Writebol, arrived from Liberia on Tuesday.
Ebola spreads through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, urine and other secretions of infected people.
It has no cure.
In Sierra Leone, where government officials have asked citizens to stay away from work, the military has deployed at least 750 medical officials to 13 locations, military spokesman Col. Michael Samura said.
CNN's David McKenzie contributed to this report from Freetown, Sierra Leone.
