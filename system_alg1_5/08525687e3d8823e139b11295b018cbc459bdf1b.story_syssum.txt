"But while a team of experts concluded that Dylan was not abused, the judge said he found the evidence inconclusive."
As a father of a child not too much older than this young woman, I can only say I hope she finds some peace and solace in the way she's expressing herself," former Connecticut State's Attorney Frank Maco said.
But he said he decided not to press charges, with Mia Farrow's support, "rather than exposing the child to possible harm."
He would respond "very soon," Dart said.

Dylan Farrow's letter appeared in Times columnist Nicholas Kristof's blog just hours before the Writers Guild Awards ceremony, for which Allen had been nominated for best screenplay for "Blue Jasmine."
"You are mistaken if you think there is a place for me, or any outsider, in this family's issue," he wrote.
