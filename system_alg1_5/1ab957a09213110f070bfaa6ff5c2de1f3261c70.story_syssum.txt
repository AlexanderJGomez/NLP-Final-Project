Yes, that's right:  Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy told WGN Radio this week that Chicago's homicide rate is "still ahead of where we were last year, which was a record."
"People always say, 'I don't feel much better, even though shootings might be down by 40%,'" McCarthy told CNN.
"We are getting out in front of a lot of shootings," the police chief told CNN.
"It's just insanity that there's such a proliferation of firearms that they're so easy to get your hands on," McCarthy told WGN Radio on Monday.
That may be an uphill climb:  In February, a federal judge struck down Chicago's ban on gun sales, saying it went "too far in outright banning legal buyers and legal dealers from engaging in lawful acquisitions."
"The media, they keep talking about the rising toll of gun violence in Chicago while the numbers are going in the other direction," McCarthy said last year.
