Then, they put me in prison.
I came to learn much later, however, that in exchange for me, they killed him.
From physical scars and disabilities, to trauma and psychosocial conditions, the horrors of this period continue to manifest themselves in survivors, families, communities and institutions.
Like many families, my mother, my deaf sister, Keo Kolthida Ekkasakh, and I, all suffered under the Khmer Rouge.
Time and again, the international community has watched mass atrocities, genocide, and other heinous crimes proceed unchecked.
This verdict regarding the two senior Khmer Rouge leaders matters a great deal to me, as should it for all Cambodians, because it gives some closure -- but closure is too little, too late for many.
If only the international community would exercise the courage and resolve as the man in prison did for me, the world would need fewer verdicts.
