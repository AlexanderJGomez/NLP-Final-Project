The suspect appeared about 6:25 p.m. Friday via video feed from Manhattan's Bellevue Hospital, where he is being held for evaluation and is on suicide watch, according to a law enforcement source.
Earlier Friday, Hernandez was sent to the hospital "because he's on medications, and we prefer to administer those in a hospital setting," said police spokesman Paul Browne, who declined to elaborate on the medications.
"Detectives believe in the credibility of the statement," Kelly said, although investigators had not uncovered any forensic evidence linking Hernandez to the boy's disappearance.
"No, I'm not, but that's not necessarily because he didn't do it," she said.
Etan, 6, went missing on May 25, 1979, a block from his home in Manhattan.
Other employees of the store were interviewed after Etan disappeared, but not Hernandez, police said.
The police investigation continues, as does the FBI's, the agency said in a statement Thursday night.
"Mr. Miller is relieved by these developments, as he was not involved in any way with Etan Patz's disappearance," said Miller's attorney, Michael C. Farkas.
A spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney's office, which reopened the case in 2010, declined to comment on the recent development.
President Ronald Reagan named May 25, the day Etan went missing, as National Missing Children's Day.
