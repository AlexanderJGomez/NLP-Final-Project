Nancy Lofaro of New Rochelle, New York, said the crew tried to do what they could, "but when we asked them, they said they had no information.
It wasn't an easy letdown by any means, but at least we got into the water and were safe, which is a lot better than, unfortunately, some people," she said.
Costa staff in Lofaro's lifeboat were debating who would drive the boat, and they didn't seem to know what to do, she said.
"The people of the island were wonderful," Fleser said.
We saw Costa people ... walking around with a bullhorn, not using it," Lofaro said.
There were two Costa cruise representatives at the hotel, "but every time we asked them if they could do something for us, they said they had no authority," she said.
The CEO of Costa's parent company, Carnival Corp., pledged support to passengers: "I give my personal assurance that we will take care of each and every one of our guests, crew and their families affected by this tragic event," Micky Arison said in a statement.
No food, no clothes, no money, no transportation.
"We also provided all kinds of advice, telephone contacts to families, helped families create travel funds, provided them with passport photos, warm clothes, there were even a couple of families that needed diapers," she said during a State Department briefing Wednesday.
