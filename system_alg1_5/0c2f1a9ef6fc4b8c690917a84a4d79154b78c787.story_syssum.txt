"He woke up in the middle of the night and started screaming and told everyone to run out of the house," said Chris Dronett, Shane Dronett's wife.
Chris tried to dismiss the incident as isolated, except that two weeks later, there was another outburst, then another, until they were an almost-nightly occurrence.
"There is evidence of CTE in his brain making him yet another former NFL player who had definite CTE," said Chris Nowinski, co-director of the traumatic encephalopathy center.
It was all uncharacteristic for a man whom Chris described as "someone who would light up the room," outgoing, affable, funny.
"What we know is that by definition, a lineman will have their head hit almost every play of every game and every practice," said Dr. Robert Stern, co-director of the BU CSTE.
"Shane didn't come out of games because he always said NFL players are so expendable," said Chris.
"I was almost relieved because I was thinking, 'OK, here is the answer to why he's acting like this, because he had a tumor,' " said Chris.
"And then after he recovered from the tumor being removed, he was back to the same symptoms of paranoia."
"He called us 100 times a day, wondering where we were and we'd tell him we're in Utah ... and he just didn't believe it," said Chris.
"I saw the gun, and I ran out the front door," said Chris.
"He was always so full of life," said Chris.
"I know a lot of the players are against that, but they're young and they haven't seen what I've seen," said Chris.
Chris says that if she could speak directly to players, "I would tell them what I went through, what Shane went through and what other people I know have gone through and then let them make that decision.
