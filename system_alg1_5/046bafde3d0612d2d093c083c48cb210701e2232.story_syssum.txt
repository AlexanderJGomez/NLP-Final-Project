Aides to Perry, who allowed Willingham's execution to go forward, started off with general questions about how things were going at the commission, a relatively new agency, Bassett said.
"As soon as we started discussing the Willingham investigation, the meeting got more confrontational and more difficult," Bassett said.
And in July, with Perry gearing up for a run for president, the state's attorney general delivered an opinion that appears to sharply limit the commission's authority.
"The case has been scrutinized and reviewed by a jury, state and federal courts, the news media, anti-death penalty activists and the Forensic Science Commission," Perry spokesman Mark Miner told CNN in an e-mail.
Perry is now seeking the Republican nomination for president, and Bassett says the Willingham case is a window into Perry's leadership.
Representatives of the attorney general's office raised no concerns about the Forensic Science Commission's jurisdiction when the panel voted unanimously to take on the Willingham investigation, he said.
Perry's campaign also noted that Willingham's ex-wife now believes in his guilt.
In Willingham's case, Perry's office says the governor was briefed on a last-minute filing by Austin-based fire science expert Gerald Hurst that found the deadly blaze was likely not arson, but he refused to grant a stay of execution for further investigation.
Beyler, then chairman of the International Association of Fire Safety Science, sharply criticized the testimony against Willingham and questioned whether it met even the standards of the day.
Stephen Saloom, the group's policy director, told CNN that the investigation should go forward for the sake of hundreds of other prisoners now serving time for arson, some of whom also may have been convicted based on outdated fire science.
