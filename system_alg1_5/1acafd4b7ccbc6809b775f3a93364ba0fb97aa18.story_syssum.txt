Dunn, 47, who is white, was convicted of first-degree murder this month for shooting into an SUV full of African-American teenagers at a Jacksonville, Florida, gas station after an argument over loud music from the teens' vehicle.
"Mr. Dunn, your life is effectively over," Healey said.
Outside court, Davis' father, Ron Davis, said the judge sent a strong message.
"I want the Davis family to know I truly regret what happened," he said.
"I did what I thought I had to do," Dunn said.
"I miss his big, wide, toothy smile," she said.
"My life as I had known it was shattered on November 23, 2012," he told the court.
"You can tell the defense attorney wrote that for him," he told CNN.
"For me to forgive you, you have to have remorse," he said.
Three of the 10 shots that Dunn fired struck Davis, one of them cutting through his liver, a lung and his aorta.
After shooting Davis, prosecutors said, Dunn did not call police.
