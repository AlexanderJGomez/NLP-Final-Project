He says, "It was a beautiful, nice day and we took the boat for a run.
Out of the harbor and into the bay, from out of nowhere really, there was a boat with men wearing balaclavas covering their faces and AK-47s.
We got interrogated about why we were in Turkey and we wanted to buy this boat, " he added.
"Recently we've done up the boat and it has been liveried up with 'Quantum of Solace' along the side, monograms, James Bond things," he says.
"Quantum of Solace" was on display for the public to visit during the show at at Kip Marina, Inverkip, west Scotland.
