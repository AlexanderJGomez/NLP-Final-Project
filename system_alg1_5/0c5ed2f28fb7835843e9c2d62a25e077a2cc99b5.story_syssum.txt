TRIPOLI, Libya (CNN) -- Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met Friday with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who asked for the latest news on the hurricanes plaguing U.S. coasts in recent weeks.
Gadhafi, wearing a white robe and a black fez but not his trademark dark sunglasses, shook the hands of the male members of Rice's staff but not Rice, instead offering the traditional greeting of his hand over his heart for her.
After their meeting, Rice joined Gadhafi, who once called Rice "Leeza ... my darling black African woman," in a traditional Muslim evening meal breaking the fast during the holy month of Ramadan.
The United States restored relations with Tripoli in 2005, after Gadhafi's decision to abandon his pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, renounce terrorism and compensate victims of the 1986 La Belle disco bombing in Berlin and the 1988 Pan Am 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.
The United States has praised Libya's cooperation in fighting terrorism in North Africa, where al Qaeda has been gaining a foothold.
Many of the Lockerbie victims' families have criticized Rice's decision to meet with Gadhafi, whom they say remains unrepentant for the explosion, which killed 280 people, 180 of them Americans.
Rice will travel throughout North Africa after leaving Tripoli, stopping in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia.
