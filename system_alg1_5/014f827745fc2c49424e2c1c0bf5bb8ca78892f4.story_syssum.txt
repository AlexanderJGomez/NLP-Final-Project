(CNN) -- It was the moment the world had been waiting for, and as he has so often in his glittering career, Lionel Messi delivered.
His vigorous celebration perhaps showed the pressure he was under to perform, as the endless comparisons to Argentina's other world famous player -- Diego Maradona -- go on.
Karim Benzema, who had put France ahead thanks to a first half penalty, fired a shot against the post only for Honduras keeper Noel Valladares to inadvertently nudge the ball towards goal.
Valladares tried to parry the ball clear as it hurtled towards him but only succeeded in flicking it over the line, the referee confirming the goal a few seconds later.
It meant that after nine matches at the World Cup, there is still to be a draw.
Switzerland, tipped by many as World Cup dark horses, struggled to get into any sort of rhythm and squandered a succession of set pieces.
"We've done it, and that's unbelievable," Hitzfeld was quoted as saying by FIFA's website.
