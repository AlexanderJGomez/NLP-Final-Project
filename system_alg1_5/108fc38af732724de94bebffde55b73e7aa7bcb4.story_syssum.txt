Nichols, 83, who directed "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" and "The Graduate," was the husband of former "ABC World News" anchor Diane Sawyer.
At one point in 1967, he had four plays running on Broadway -- including two by Neil Simon, "Barefoot in the Park" and "The Odd Couple" -- and he was a go-to guy for stage works until the end of his life, helming Tom Stoppard's "The Real Thing" (1984), "Monty Python's Spamalot" (2005) and a 2012 revival of "Death of a Salesman" starring Philip Seymour Hoffman.
Hoffman observed that Benjamin Braddock, the character he played in "The Graduate," was a tall, blond, WASP-y type in the novel.

As recounted in the book "Faces of America," a young Nichols arrived in the United States knowing only two phrases: "I don't speak English" and "Please, don't kiss me."
"I liked doing the stand-up," Nichols told The Hollywood Reporter in 2012.
For a time he was Broadway's golden boy, with success following success: "Luv" (1964), "The Odd Couple" (1965), "The Apple Tree" (1966, featuring a young Alan Alda), "Plaza Suite" (1968) and "The Prisoner of Second Avenue" (1971).
"Barefoot," "Odd Couple," "Plaza Suite" and "Second Avenue" were all written by Neil Simon.
"Nichols and veteran cinematographer Robert Surtees threw out the (Directors Guild) playbook for 'The Graduate,' experimenting wildly with lighting and lenses, lending the film a sense of freewheeling freshness, a sheen of visual inventiveness that hasn't dimmed over the years," wrote Slant magazine's Budd Wilkins in a 2012 look back.
"No one was more passionate about his craft than Mike," James Goldston, president of ABC News, said in a note to the staff.
"I found her and said, 'You're my hero.'
I pretended that I was up for it, and we had about 14 lunches."
