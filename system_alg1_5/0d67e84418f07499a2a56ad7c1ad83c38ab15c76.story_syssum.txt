According to the Star-Ledger, the report said TSA agents stationed at the Newark airport would stop Mexicans and Dominicans, asking them additional questions, reviewing their passports and visas and searching their luggage.
Four managers in the report were cited to be disciplined by the TSA, the Star-Ledger said.
A story published by the Star-Ledger Sunday said the newspaper had obtained the report, but did not disclose how.
At the time, the TSA told CNN no single behavior on the list would, by itself, ever be enough to draw increased security scrutiny.
An officer would only select a passenger for closer examination if they showed several signs of stress, fear or deception, the agency said.
