The six, who are between ages 27 and 38, lived in a tight space the size of six buses in a row, said Rosita Suenson, the agency's program officer for human spaceflight.
The simulated trip replicated all aspects of a real spaceflight to Mars, including orbiting the planet, landing and returning to Earth.
Extra seclusion will allow them to get reacquainted with their surroundings, including sound and light, Suenson said.
The six had personal items such as books, films and personal laptops during their stay at the facility in Moscow's Institute for Biomedical Problems.
