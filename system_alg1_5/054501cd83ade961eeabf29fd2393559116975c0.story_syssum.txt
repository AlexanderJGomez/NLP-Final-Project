"The establishment of a permanent broadcast and production center in the Middle East by CNN is a significant and unique move by a Western news broadcaster," added Maddox.
For the first time in CNN's history, daily live news show "PRISM," presented by Stan Grant, will be broadcast from the Middle East.
CNN Abu Dhabi will also be home to CNN's perennially popular feature shows, "Inside the Middle East," now in its sixth year, and "Marketplace Middle East," which launched two years ago.
