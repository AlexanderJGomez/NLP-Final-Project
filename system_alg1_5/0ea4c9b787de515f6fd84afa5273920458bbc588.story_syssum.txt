Burning coal contributes half of the excess carbon dioxide (CO2) polluting the earth's atmosphere, a statistic not lost on the hundreds of climate change protesters camping in a grassy field near Kingsnorth power station in Kent, England this week.
The International Energy Agency estimates CCS could reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by more than 85 percent.
Well, it is being done, but only a small scale.
Last week, Australia's national science agency, the CSIRO, announced plans to test China's first post-combustion capture (PCC) technology at a pilot plant in Beijing.
"It's a very immature economic market," says Ian Phillips, director of infrastructure at CO2DeepStore, a UK-based company dedicated to the commercialization of carbon storage.
In 2014, the system is set to change.
"The problem is that the price of maybe €35 ($54) or €40 ($62) per ton of carbon dioxide will not be enough to fund the gap in the extra estimated cost of these new power plants," explains Professor Haszeldine.
In a word, no.
In some instances, the CO2 could be stored under residential areas, but strict licensing procedures and the need for constant, rigorous testing should allay fears.
Have your say.
