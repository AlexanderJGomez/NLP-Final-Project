And, it turns out, many of them were outright lies.
It all began Monday when Hurricane Sandy was approaching landfall and the owner of the Twitter account @ComfortablySmug, whose bio lists interests including "Finance, Gin, Politics, Books, Food, Fine Clothing (and) Meeting Strangers," began posting rapid-fire tweets to his 6,500 followers.
And he contributed to the confusion surrounding reports, which proved to be false, that the New York Stock Exchange had flooded.
Stuef identified the account owner as Shashank Tripathi, a hedge fund analyst and campaign manager for a candidate for Congress.
"I wish to offer the people of New York a sincere, humble and unconditional apology," he wrote after Stuef's story had identified him.
In a statement posted Wednesday afternoon on his campaign site, Wight said he was "shocked and disgusted" by Tripathi's behavior.
"His actions were all the more distressing, occurring as they did, in the midst of Monday's disastrous weather -- during a time when no one was truly safe," he wrote.
"The Manhattan DA is taking this very seriously," Vallone, a Democrat, told Buzzfeed, while acknowledging it may be a hard case to make.
