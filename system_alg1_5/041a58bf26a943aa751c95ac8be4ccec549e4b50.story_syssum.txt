(CNN) -- A Boston-area man, who was planning to kidnap children, lock them in a basement dungeon, rape and eat them, should be imprisoned for at least 27 years, federal authorities said in court documents filed this week.
Portway went by the moniker "Fat Longpig" during his online chats, according to court documents.
Portway's lawyer, Richard J. Sweeney, told CNN that Tuesday's sentencing hearing will be "the proper time to address all the issues addressed by the government."
A lot of the chats that he had were, in his mind, fantasy," Sweeney said.
Photographs reviewed by CNN show handcuffs, rope intended for bondage, mouth gags, and castration tools.
One was a puppeteer who, authorities say, plotted with Portway to kidnap children the puppeteer knew from his work at a local Florida church.
