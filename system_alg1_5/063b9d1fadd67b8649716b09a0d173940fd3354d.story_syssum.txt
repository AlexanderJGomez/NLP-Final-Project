In doing so, they found several "gene clusters" that appear to cause eight distinct classes of schizophrenia, according to a statement from the university.
"Genes don't operate by themselves," Dr. C. Robert Cloninger, one of the study's senior authors, explained in the statement.
Then they identified 42 interactive SNP sets that significantly increased people's risk of schizophrenia, according to the study.
"In the past, scientists had been looking for associations between individual genes and schizophrenia," co-author Dr. Dragan Svrakic said in the statement.
"Schizophrenia is probably 80 different diseases," Raison says.
Take, for example, pleurisy, which is a condition where the liquid around your lungs becomes inflamed.
The same could hold true for schizophrenia and other mental health conditions, Raison says.
