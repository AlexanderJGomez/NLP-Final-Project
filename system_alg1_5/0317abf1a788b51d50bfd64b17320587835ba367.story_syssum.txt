Sultan Munad, an Afghan journalist accompanying Farrell, also was killed in the raid, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said.
Crossfire during the raid also killed a woman and a child, said Abdel Wahid Omar Khil, governor of Kunduz district, in Kunduz province, where the rescue took place.
I could hear British and Afghan voices," Farrell, a 46-year-old dual Irish-British citizen, told the paper.
He's dead," Farrell told the paper.
Farrell's citizenship played a role in the British decision to stage the rescue, said a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.
Of the commando, Brown said, "His bravery will not be forgotten."
That they undertook it in such circumstances showed breathtaking heroism," Brown said.
The driver did not escape, the newspaper said.
In a separate incident Wednesday, a suicide attack killed at least two civilians and injured several others, including NATO personnel, near the main British military base in southern Afghanistan, the ISAF said.
The injured civilians and ISAF personnel were treated at Camp Bastion, which is in Washir District.
