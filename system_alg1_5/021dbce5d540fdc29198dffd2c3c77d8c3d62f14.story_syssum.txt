Though it sounds like behavior at one of the health care town hall meetings last month, it was how some Republicans reacted to President Obama's speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday night.
The most memorable moment came from Rep. Joe Wilson, R-South Carolina, who shouted "You lie" after the president said that a Democratic-sponsored health care bill would not cover illegal immigrants.
Congress, as you know, is pretty polarized," said Kasie Hunt, a health care reporter for National Journal's Congress Daily.
John O'Connor, who covers politics for The State newspaper in South Carolina, said that a lot of Wilson's anger mirrors what many feel in his home state.
"Rep. Wilson, however, held a town hall meeting in Columbia where, for the most part, there was a pretty reasoned debate," he added.
"His takeaway from that was that people support his stance, which was to oppose any version of what he's calling Obamacare," he said.
Pelosi said Thursday that there is a procedure that could have been implemented to strike Wilson's "lie" comment from the record.
It's time for us to talk about health care and not Mr. Wilson," she said.
During the 2008 election, when support for Democrats and Obama was high, Wilson faced a tough slog against Miller.
"It was a gift, in a way, to Barack Obama," he said.
