(CNN) -- Sitting in the first lady's box listening to the President Barack Obama push for movement on immigration reform, Cristian Avila no longer had to keep his head down and live in fear of being deported.
And, for the last two years, Avila's been working as a voter engagement coordinator for Mi Familia Vota, a non-profit Latino civic engagement program.
We revived the conversation," Avila said.
So let's get immigration reform done this year," he said.
"We're going to outline our standards, principles of immigration reform and have a conversation with members," House Speaker John Boehner said during a news conference after a party meeting.
Still, Avila remains optimistic that immigration reform will happen in 2014.
It shouldn't take any longer," Avila said.
