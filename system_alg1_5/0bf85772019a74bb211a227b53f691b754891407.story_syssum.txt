A Toyota Prius hybrid, owned  by Luscious Garage, has been converted to run on electricity.
And, she says, with gas prices at more than $4 per gallon, she expects even more interest.
"Gas becomes optional," with this conversion, Coquillette said.
And that's very liberating," she said.
But for hybrid owners who demonstrate exuberant efforts to find more energy efficiency, "we really appreciate the fact that the Prius is the vehicle of choice," said Jana Hartline, environmental communications manager for Toyota.
Much more research is needed, she said, about how hybrid owners would use their vehicles.
Also, as more drivers become interested in alternative energy, they will need to learn more about infrastructure.
People come to me and say, 'I want to do this right away,' " said Coquillette.
Then there is plug-in hybrid technology, which is the next step, which genuinely removes your dependence on fossil fuel," said Coquillette.
