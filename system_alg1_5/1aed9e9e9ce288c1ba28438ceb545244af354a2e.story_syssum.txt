But the location, high above Madeira island's capital of Funchal, qualifies this venue for attention.
This stadium is for real and boasts good facilities, including the Cristiano Ronaldo football academy, but its surreal setting takes some beating.
And, since it was built, the team's fortunes on the pitch have improved as well, culminating in them reaching the final of the Europa League last year.
Situated in the Croatian city of Rijeka and home to the club of the same name, this stadium might be small, holding only 10,000 fans, but is perfectly formed.
But what really sets it apart is the paneling that makes up the facade, which can be independently lit with white, red, or blue light depending on which team is playing there -- something no other arena in the world can do.
Situated in the capital city La Paz, at 3,637 meters (11,932 feet) above sea level, it is Bolivia's national arena and plays host to three club teams, including the appropriately named The Strongest.
For years, international opponents claimed Bolivia had an unfair advantage playing there, and it's hard to argue with some of the results it has spawned.
Yet, despite its location on the windy Mediterranean coast, and repeated proposed renovation projects, spectators must suffer everything that nature has to offer, as the stadium has no roofing on the stands.
The Svangaskard holds just 6,000 fans but once been, never forgotten.
Built at a cost of $600 million in time for the 2010 World Cup, not only is it pleasing on the eye, but its location is simply stunning.
And, as if it didn't have enough going for it, the stadium also played host to some of the best matches during the World Cup, with Germany beating Argentina 4-0 and the five-goal semifinal thriller between the Netherlands and Uruguay just two of its highlights.
