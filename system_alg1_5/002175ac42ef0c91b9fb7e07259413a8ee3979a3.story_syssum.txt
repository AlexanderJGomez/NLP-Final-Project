Qena, Egypt (CNN) -- In a deserted playground a few hundred miles south of Cairo, 13-year-old Asmaa Ashraf fiddles with a broken rusted slide.
"At my school, we'll learn," she says, brushing her hands longingly over the slide.
The situation is worst in regions far from the capital, and in Upper Egypt, where more than half the population is under 29.
"We didn't have enough desks last year," recalls Asmaa's 12-year-old neighbor, Omnia.
We only get a little paper, but my mom found this," she said, holding up a small, faded "Hannah Montana" notebook.
"There are too many issues to deal with," said one 32-year-old teacher in Asmaa's village.
For parents with any hope that their children will be better off, investing in education is essential.
Also, 70% of young women in Upper Egypt are jobless.
And now, despite a revolution for dignity ... there is none."
However, as Egypt's public education system founders, a few innovative ideas have emerged.
Another innovative initiative is Teach for Egypt, a start-up created by Nada Ramadan, a 24-year-old Egyptian who's a graduate student at Georgetown University in Washington.
"So, that's what we're trying to do."
But until those solutions are offered, Asmaa -- and a whole generation in waiting -- will continue to linger near broken slides, daydreaming about the future.
