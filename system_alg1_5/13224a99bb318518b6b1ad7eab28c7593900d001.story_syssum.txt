"The Tahrir is leaving port in Crete, and we are breaking through Israel's Gaza blockade which now extends to Greek ports," organizer David Heap said in the statement.
The ship's Twitter feed carried a tweet from a journalist on board, Jim Rankin, saying kayakers were blocking the Coast Guard, and the Canadian boat had left the harbor.
But the ship tweeted, "We left port without a captain.
Supporters from town are chanting, 'Free Gaza, Free Greece,' " the ship tweeted.
Last week, the Greek Coast Guard intercepted a U.S. ship in the flotilla, the Audacity of Hope, about 10 minutes after it left Perama, triggering an hours-long standoff.
But Chief Palestinian Negotiator Saeb Erakat said Sunday that funneling food, cement and other goods via other means, such as Greek ships, missed the point, which he said is to "immediately lift, not ease" Israel's maritime blockade of Gaza.
Israel also emphasizes that it delivers large amounts of aid to Gaza.
It's pathetic."
Erakat said.
