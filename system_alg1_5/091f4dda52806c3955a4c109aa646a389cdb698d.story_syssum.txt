"It is not simply that WWE has failed to protect its wrestlers," court documents say.
"WWE has never concealed any medical information related to concussions, or otherwise, from our talent," said Jerry McDevitt from the K&L Gates law firm.
As a result of his wrestling injuries, the suit alleges, LoGrasso suffers from serious neurological damage, which includes severe headaches, memory loss, depression, anxiety and deafness.
"WWE's representations, actions and inactions have caused its wrestlers to suffer long-term debilitating injuries, lost profits, premature retirement, medical expenses, and other loses," the suit states.
