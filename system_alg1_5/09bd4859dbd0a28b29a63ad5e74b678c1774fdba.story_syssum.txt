On Monday alone, robbers targeted five banks in the Big Apple, some striking in broad daylight and near famous landmarks.
"As it stands now, they've turned [banks] into virtual cash machines," New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said.
I think it's too early to make that statement," he said.
"Bank robbery is a very high-risk activity, because most banks have various surveillance equipment in place, and it requires a degree of aggressiveness that otherwise law-abiding folks are not likely to take on," Blumstein said.
Mike Smith, president and CEO of the New York Bankers Association, is meeting with the NYPD to see what more can be done to discourage robbers.
Criminals talk to each other, they know what's going on, but typically they are apprehended," Mike Smith said.
