Back in its prime, the Wichita, Kansas, theme park drew families with novelty rides, carnival food and live entertainment.
The theme park, which had been operating for 55 years, closed in 2004.
"In this Internet era, people are looking for something different to do, and a lot of amusement parks are able to capitalize on that," he said.
This includes several smaller theme parks that closed in the mid-2000s, including some that had survived a century, Futrell said.
It's what brought her and her family to the gates of Land of Oz, a relic theme park, sitting all alone on top of Beech Mountain in North Carolina.
"I don't think you are supposed to walk in the way we did," she said.
"The gates are there, there were the yellow bricks, and the shell of what used to be a castle.
The theme park hasn't been operational since the 1980s, when it first shut down.
"You get the grounds to yourself, and you can stroll the yellow brick road," Keller said.
"There is something about local amusement parks," he said.
"When you go to Six Flags, I don't think you have the same emotional connection to that park like a smaller theme park gives you."
