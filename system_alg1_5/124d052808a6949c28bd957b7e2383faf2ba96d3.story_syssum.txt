In 2008, after a bruising primary battle with Hillary Clinton, then-Sen. Barack Obama was on the outs with former President Bill Clinton.
"Clinton just wants to help," a source close to the former president said.
"You know, I'm old-fashioned.
"I'm here, not my husband," Hillary Clinton said to Obama.
"I have a general rule, which is that whatever he asked me about my advice, and whatever I say, should become public only if he decides to make it public," Clinton told reporters then.
Clinton later clarified his remarks, but the damage was done.
