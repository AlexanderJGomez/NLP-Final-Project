The Indonesian and South Korean pairs appealed the decision, the federation said.
"It's not in the spirit of the thing," said Kevin Button of Ashford, in Kent, just outside London.
In the first of the Tuesday matches under scrutiny, Wang and Yu played South Korea's Jung Kyung-eun and Kim Ha-na in a game in which "neither side seemed to be exerting themselves," the official Olympic news service said.
"It was a decision they had to make, and they had to make quickly," he said.
"These players, I feel for them a little bit, because this wasn't their decision; their team has told them to lose these games," he said.
The Chinese Sports Delegation feels saddened," it said.
"As the head coach, I owe the fans and the Chinese an apology," he said, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua.
Competition has been dominated by China, Indonesia, South Korea and Denmark, according to the federation.
