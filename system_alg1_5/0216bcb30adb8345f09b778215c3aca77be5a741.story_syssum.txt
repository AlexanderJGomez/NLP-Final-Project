A federal judge struck down Oregon's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage Monday.
I believe that if we can look for a moment past gender and sexuality, we can see in these plaintiffs nothing more or less than our own families, families who we would expect our Constitution to protect, if not exalt, in equal measure," McShane said.
It's amazing," he said.
Ten years ago, Rouse said, the first same-sex marriages in the United States were celebrated in Massachusetts.
Meanwhile, the National Organization for Marriage, which opposes same-sex marriage, said it had filed a motion with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals asking judges to block McShane's ruling.
Seventeen other states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriage within their borders: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.
"The importance of Judge McShane's decision cannot be overemphasized," said David Fidanque, executive director of the ACLU of Oregon.
This type of discrimination is wrong, and it's also unconstitutional."
In Utah, the state is appealing a judge's decision to overturn its voter-approved ban of same-sex marriage.
In Oregon, officials are taking the opposite tack, praising the judge's ruling overturning their state's same-sex marriage ban.
"Today is a win for love, for families, and for freedom."
