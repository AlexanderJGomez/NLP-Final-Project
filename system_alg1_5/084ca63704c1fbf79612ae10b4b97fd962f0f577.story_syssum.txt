Actress Skye McCole Bartusiak, who played Mel Gibson's youngest daughter in "The Patriot," died Saturday at her home in Houston, her mother said Sunday.
Bartusiak had been preparing to produce and direct her first feature film in recent months, her mother said.
"They were working on her for 45 minutes and could not get a heartbeat," she said.
"The girl has lived such an amazing life," she said.
