Thanksgiving is a favorite day for football fans, close-knit families, families who can't stand each other, and of course, amateur competitive eaters.
There's even a website, www.blackfridaydeathcount.com, which tracks and compiles statistics on injuries and deaths.
Granted, it's an open invitation to every nudnik, whose only qualifications are: 1) They don't have to be at work; and 2) they are willing to wake up at 5 a.m. to elbow their way to saving $3 on a Sony Discman or a Cabbage Patch Doll.
You might think an "invitee" is someone who is just invited on to the property, say, for a cocktail party, but that's not it.
An "invitee," on the other hand, is someone who enters the land for a purpose connected with or benefiting the business owner.
When you shop at a store, you're considered an "invitee."
According to the guidelines, there should be adequate security, and sufficient crowd control measures.
But, if a store is deliberately indifferent to security problems, then it may be liable where it knowingly ignores the behavior of that riffraff.
If a Black Friday sale devolves into the running of the bulls in Pamplona, and the store knowingly allowed dangerous conditions on the property, it's likely that the store will be held liable for injuries on the premises.
Ultimately, if a mall encourages this behavior, maybe it gets exactly what it deserves.
