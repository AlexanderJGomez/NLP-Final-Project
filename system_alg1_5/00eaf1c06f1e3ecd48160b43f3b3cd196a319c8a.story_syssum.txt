Biochar's high carbon content and porous nature can help soil retain water, nutrients, protect soil microbes.
Some examples are woodchips, corn husks, peanut shells, even chicken manure.
"Soil acts as an enormous carbon pool, increasing this carbon pool could significantly contribute to the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere," said Christoph Steiner, one of the leading research scientist studying biochar.
Since 2000, increases of 2 parts per million of CO2 have been common, according to NOAA.
Some of the gases given off during the process can be converted to electricity, others can be condensed and converted to gasoline, and there are also some pharmaceutical applications for the by-products, said Danny Day President and CEO of Eprida, a private firm in Athens, Georgia currently exploring industry applications for the biochar process.
"These terra preta soils are older than 500 years and they are still black soil and very rich in carbon," said Steiner, a professor at the University of Georgia.
"We have 3 billion people out there who are at risk for climate change and they can be making money solving our global problem," said Day.
