And on Wednesday, a judge extended the officer's detention six more days, according to a court order.
According to a medical report, Nowarah was pronounced dead in a hospital less than two hours later, having suffered a single bullet wound that entered his chest and passed out his back.
However, Khadder's camera shows that less than 15 seconds after one of these gunshots, Palestinians were already racing to put the fatally wounded Nowarah in the ambulance.
It was not immediately clear what connection, if any, this soldier had to the arrested border police officer.
The bullet, found at the time of death in the teen's backpack, and the three bullet fragments, found in his body, were handed to Israeli investigators, Michaeli said.
