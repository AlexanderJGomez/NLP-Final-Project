Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A judge has delayed the preliminary hearing for Dr. Conrad Murray, charged in Michael Jackson's death, until early next year because more investigation is being done and some prosecution witnesses won't be available until then.
Murray, hired as Jackson's personal doctor while the singer rehearsed for his comeback concerts, admitted giving him propofol as a sleep aid.
"Dr. Murray's the fall guy," Jermaine Jackson said after the hearing.
Jackson fans have organized protests at each hearing, taunting Murray as he enters and departs the courthouse.
