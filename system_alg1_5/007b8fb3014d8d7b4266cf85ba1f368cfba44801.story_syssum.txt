But, aware of the program that started this month, Sable took a $4,500 federal credit this week to trade in the Jeep and buy a new, more fuel-efficient Chrysler PT Cruiser.
And Chrysler, eager to sell vehicles, threw in its own $4,500 incentive.
Under the $1 billion program, people will be given credits of $3,500 to $4,500 to replace gas guzzlers -- generally vehicles with a combined city/highway fuel economy of 18 miles per gallon or less -- with new vehicles that are more fuel efficient.
The government put Sable's old Jeep at 15 mpg.
His new PT Cruiser, which the program classifies as an SUV, gets a combined 21 mpg.
If they had sold the Trooper themselves, they might have gotten $3,000 if they were lucky, she said.
But the program worked just fine for iReporter Julie Callahan, a Salt Lake City, Utah, woman who was looking to replace her 1990 Chevy C1500 pickup truck, which had more than 350,000 miles and is rated at 15 mpg.
Like Sable, Callahan, 39, got $4,500 this week to turn in the old vehicle and buy a new PT Cruiser.
"Without the incentives, I probably wouldn't have purchased a brand new vehicle," Callahan, who runs a science outreach program at the University of Utah, told CNN after filing her iReport.
