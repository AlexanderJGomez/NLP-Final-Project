But in the last five years, the festival has grown bigger and more commercial.
Twitter's ascension meant many more start-ups began trying to use the festival, which is filled with influential early adopters, as a launching pad for their products.
Last year, the fest saw another spike, to nearly 20,000 attendees.
It's one of the things that South By is built on and that's good," Forrest said.
"One of the tensions we faced this year is we've got lots and lots of the start-up stuff and that's very exciting, but at the same time, it's not completely what we're about."
For the first time, the festival will give out a Hall of Fame award at its Interactive Awards ceremony.
Last year Interactive got attention for a community effort that was completely unplanned and that didn't spring from the fest itself: After earthquakes and tsunamis devastated Japan on the opening day of the festival, attendees launched "SXSW4Japan," which raised funds for relief efforts.
It's trying very hard to be both sprawling and intimate, continually plugged-in but also right there in person.
Like any ambitious 19-year-old, SXSW Interactive is restless, driven and hard to pigeonhole.
