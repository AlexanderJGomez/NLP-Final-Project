"In winning this prestigious accolade, Singapore Changi Airport cements its place as one of the world's favorite airports," said Edward Plaisted, chairman of Skytrax.
Other destinations to rank highly in the best airport category this year include Hong Kong International and Beijing Capital International, carrying on a tradition of strong Asian performance at the awards.
Only one non-Asian airport has ever won the sought-after prize, Amsterdam Schiphol in 1999, the award's inaugural year.
