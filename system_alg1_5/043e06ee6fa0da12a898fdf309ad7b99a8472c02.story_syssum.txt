However, the bombings at two churches and a third in Kaduna left at least 50 people dead and 131 wounded according to the Red Cross.
The Nigerian Red Cross Society, however, reported that two people died and 22 were injured in the attack.
Later, at least 10 people died in a bombing at a church in the city of Kaduna, Red Cross spokesman Andronicus Adeyemo said.
A week ago, a car bomb killed five people during services at a church in Jos, also in northern Nigeria.
Boko Haram has previously carried out attacks, including at churches, according to government officials.
It seeks to overthrow the government and replace it with a regime based on Islamic law.
