"We can't wait to be over with everything," the woman, who asked to be identified only by her first name, Louise, told CNN's Anderson Cooper.
Louise told CNN's Cooper by phone that she is checking her temperature every hour, and based on that and everything else, isn't sick.
"But (authorities) said we shouldn't throw anything away until they can get back with me," Louise said.
Once everything is cleaned up, even if plenty of food arrives, Louise's ordeal is far from over.
Judge Clay Jenkins, also director of the county's Homeland Security and Emergency Management, said officials are working on that relocation after Duncan's partner told CNN of being forced to live with distressing living conditions.
"We have some hygiene issues that we are addressing in that apartment," Jenkins said earlier in the day.
When Duncan arrived in the United States on September 20, "he didn't tell me that he came in contact with anybody with Ebola," Louise said.
"I was so (scared)," Louise said.
So, too, is Peterson Wayne.
Wilfred Smallwood, Duncan's half-brother, said his 21-year-old son is also among those quarantined in Louise's apartment, where he lived.
Still, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta said the continuing presence of the sheets, on which Duncan may have transmitted the virus through sweating, are disturbing.
"So far, we don't seem to reacting as well as we could," he said.
