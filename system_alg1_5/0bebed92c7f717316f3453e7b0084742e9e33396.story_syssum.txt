Peasants in eastern Paraguay opened fire Friday on police trying to evict them from private property, initiating the deadly confrontation, local authorities and state-run media said.
Three of the police officers were flown to Asuncion for treatment, the official news agency said.
Rodriguez lamented the loss of life, but said the peasant leaders did not order the attack on police.
In a special session, the House of Representatives observed a minute of silence in honor of the dead, the Agency of Public Information reported.
