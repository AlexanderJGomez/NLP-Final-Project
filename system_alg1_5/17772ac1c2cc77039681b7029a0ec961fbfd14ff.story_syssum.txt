Their criticisms are specious and predictable.
First, critics say the agreement doesn't go far enough.
To achieve 2C, further cuts beyond those spelled out in the agreement will be needed.
Further, while we need goals, and 2C is an important one, we have to understand that we don't get to give up if we miss them.
If 2C is dangerous, 3C or 4C is more so.
On the U.S. side, at least, the howls from Congress show that this argument isn't completely true.
The most successful global environmental agreement to date is the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which began the phasing out of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in order to stop the depletion of stratospheric ozone.
Under the circumstances, this new agreement couldn't realistically solve climate as completely as the Montreal Protocol solved ozone.
And it is one not despite the fact that its goals are attainable, but because of that.
