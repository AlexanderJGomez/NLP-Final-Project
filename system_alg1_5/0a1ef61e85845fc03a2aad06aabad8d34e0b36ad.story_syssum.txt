The "Three Amigos" -- or, as they're more formally known, the leaders of the United States, Canada and Mexico -- announced an agreement Wednesday to work on a plan to streamline trade and travel, including border controls among the countries.

"It would not be in the interest of the United States to put this on the back burner," one official said.
"I think what President Obama will do is explain to him where we are in the review of the Keystone pipeline, and indicate that we'll, of course, let our Canadian friends know when we've arrived at a decision," a senior administration official said.
"With respect to immigration, I think President Pe√±a Nieto has a very good understanding, frankly, of the state of play in the United States," a senior administration official said.
