At last, with "Brave," it's the girls' turn to shine -- a bit behind the curve in this year of the Warrior Princess.
Headstrong, with cascading, blazing red locks, Merida is a tomboy.
Mother-daughter relationships are still at a premium in big-budget flicks, and "Brave" observes their squabbling with an affectionate, even-handed familiarity that's nice to see.
Appealing as this left-field plot twist is, it's also daft.
By anyone else's standards, "Brave" stands as a crisp, lively frolic, brimming with texture and color (all those follicles!).
It's sure to appeal to the wee bairns -- and their mams too.
