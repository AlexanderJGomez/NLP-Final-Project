Either way, South Korean defense officials said on Friday they were sure that they came from North Korea and that they were up to no good.
Scientists found a "smoking gun that all three were sent from North Korea and are programmed to return to North Korea," South Korean defense spokesman Kim Min-soek said.
Japanese-made digital cameras, which look like they could be of the consumer variety, were inserted into the bellies of the drones and had taken aerial photos of the South from around the border region.
The type of drone is not used for long-range missions, a defense analyst said.
North Korea has flaunted similar, larger UAVs at military parades in recent years, and some of them have been spiked with explosives, Hardy said.
Annual U.S.-South Korean joint military drills, that ended on April 7, drew criticism from North Korea, which views the exercises as "dress rehearsals for invasion," according to analyst James Person from the Woodrow Wilson Center.
The drones would fit well into that category, since they slipped through South Korean air defenses.
They are made of polycarbonate, which is difficult to detect with radar, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.
