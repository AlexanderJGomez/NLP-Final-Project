According to Morrissey, he's had a cancer scare, although in talking about the disease, the singer doesn't seem that scared at all.
And if I don't, then I don't.
"The reports of my death have been greatly understated," Morrissey wrote.
He concluded the letter by signing off, "pause at my headstone, MORRISSEY."
Then, of course, you get these bitchy comments for having to cancel shows....
Whatever the diagnosis, Morrissey is back out on the road, and NME reports that the singer's backing band is proudly donning shirts that say "F*** Harvest" as a nod to his record label after the label released Moz's new LP "World Peace Is None of Your Business."
