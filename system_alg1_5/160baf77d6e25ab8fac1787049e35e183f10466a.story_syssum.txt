(CNN) -- It may not be "High Noon," but the Red Bull team are facing a Shanghai showdown when their two drivers resume rivalries at this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix.
"Obviously there is an interest in doing the best for the team," Barrichello told CNN.
"I don't think there's the same respect now for other drivers," British racing legend Stirling Moss told CNN.
"When a team had the lead, the number one driver would hold position and not pass him, says Moss.
It didn't worry me," he said.
"In my case in Austria there were eight laps of conversation because they told me that I should do something that was not agreed," he explained.
But there wasn't, says Barrichello.
"I saw that there was no winning scenario, the case was lost," he said.
Team orders have always existed in F1 because, in simple terms, teams also want to be happy -- and that often means making money.
"The team has always been the most important thing," said Moss.
"I don't think drivers accept that," says Barrichello.
"I suppose he was a naughty boy," Moss says, "but he is a racing driver who's paid to go fast.
Vettel, Webber and Red Bull will begin to find out how much crossing that line in Malaysia has hurt them when they reunite in Shanghai.
