For a company that hasn't attended CES since 1992, Apple dominates the show.
The biggest reason for this is, of course, Apple's dominating presence in the consumer electronic space.
"We know that Apple is doing well," said Howard Cheng, Just Mobile's director of operations.
"Apple owners have a demonstrated willingness to spend for accessories, cases, and other customizations," Govin said.
There's iLounge, iBattz, iSkin, iConnectivity, iPort and even iCat all within a few feet of each other on the show floor.
"I don't care," said Raymond Meng, president of iSmartAlarm.
"At this point, I don't think Apple needs to be here," he said.
But the CEA, the organization that puts on the show, says that Apple skipping out isn't a big deal.
It's here, even if it isn't.
