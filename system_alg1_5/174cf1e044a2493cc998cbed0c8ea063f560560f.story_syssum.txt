COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Sri Lankan soldiers have seized a key rebel stronghold after launching a surprise attack early Sunday morning, the head of Sri Lanka's army announced.
The rebels gained control over Mullaittivu in 1996 and established a military garrison there, according to the government.
"The area that the LTTE has dominated has shrank phenomenally," Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India, C.R Jayasinghe, told CNN.
"Some Sri Lankan U.N. staff are trapped there," he added.
"They (Sri Lankan authorities) are also directly responsible for subjecting journalists to harassment and interrogation," she said.
Others have been driven from the country by death threats, or in fear of detention and torture by government authorities, it said.
