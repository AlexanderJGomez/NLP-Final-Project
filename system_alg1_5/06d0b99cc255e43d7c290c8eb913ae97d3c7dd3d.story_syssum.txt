The records, which were released Friday by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, confirm what has been known for some time: that most of the justices are relatively well-off financially.
Justice Samuel Alito, the newest member of the high court, also reported income ranging from $700,000 to $2 million.
The latest financial records continue to show Justices Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas reporting assets under $1 million, not including homes and judicial salaries.
Airfare, lodging and meals were generally paid for by the organizations that invited the justices, but under federal law, they must report it.
In the same week in July, Kennedy and Chief Justice Roberts were in France and Austria, respectively.
Before becoming a federal judge, Roberts was a high-paid Washington lawyer.
Roberts, 53, continued to sell off small amounts of common stock, including in Cisco and Citigroup.
No reason was given for their recusal, but financial disclosure reports showed that Roberts, along with Breyer and Alito, owns stock in several of the companies being sued.
With four of the nine recused, the high court had no choice but to uphold the lower court ruling, tossing out the lawsuit.
