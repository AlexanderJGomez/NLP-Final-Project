When I speak about getting him a Father's Day gift, he says the best gift I can give him is to live a good, healthy life.
Before he knew of my condition, my father, 63, had made plans to climb to Mount Everest's base camp with close friends, and it was scheduled for about two months after surgery.
Those years are tough ones, and when the organ finally arrives, it may be too late.
Since the transplant, my father and I have celebrated holidays, gone skiing, enjoyed wine, argued and laughed -- essentially behaved like a normal father and daughter -- with the exception that we share his original pair of kidneys.
I am alive today thanks to my father, and I hope to make him proud.
