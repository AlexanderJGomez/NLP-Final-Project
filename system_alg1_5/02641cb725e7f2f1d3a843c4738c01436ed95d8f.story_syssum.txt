Earlier Sunday, a spokesman for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL, had said that a "serious shooting incident" was taking place along the Israel-Lebanon border.
Israeli and Lebanese forces are cooperating in the investigation, the statement said.
An initial inquiry confirmed the sniper is a member of the Lebanese Armed Forces, it said, adding that further investigation is under way.
In late August, the Israeli air force conducted a strike in Lebanon between Beirut and Sidon, a day after rockets struck northern Israel, according to the IDF.
