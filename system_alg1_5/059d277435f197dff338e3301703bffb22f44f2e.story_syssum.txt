"Because we still have a long way to go to get Americans back to work and strengthen our economy, the President will announce on Friday that he will sign a new Executive Order creating a new board, the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, which will have a new composition and new mission as we move to a new phase in our economic recovery," a White House statement said.
Two weeks ago, the president tapped Treasury aide Gene Sperling as the new director of the National Economic Council.
Sperling also headed the National Economic Council during the Clinton administration.
