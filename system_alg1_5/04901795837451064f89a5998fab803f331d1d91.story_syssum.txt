Robert Lewandowski, the Poland striker, was already one of the most feared forwards in European football before his took the field.
"It was an unbelievable," Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp told Sky Sports.
Forget that Real, the nine-time winners and richest club in the world, was expected to qualify for the final.
The fresh faced innocence, the youthful zest, the unbounded energy, all these traits have helped shape a Dortmund side, which is quickly winning the hearts of football fans across the globe.
Everywhere you looked on the field, Dortmund was in control.
Real would have expected Dortmund to start at breakneck speed, but even it was taken aback by the pace, power and ferocity of the German side.
Ronaldo's strike, his sixth in six consecutive Champions League games, appeared to have left Dortmund in a daze.
His third followed soon after, and when it came, it was worth waiting for.
"I think Dortmund were the best team by far," Real boss Mourinho told Sky Sports.
I don't know.
It's very disappointing.
They are a great side."
