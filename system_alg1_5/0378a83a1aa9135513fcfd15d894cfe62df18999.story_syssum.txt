The U.S. military fired at a vehicle it believed carried David Drugeon, a skilled bomb-maker in his 20s who also has ties to core al Qaeda members in Pakistan, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The strikes happened in the area of Sarmada, Syria, the military said.
Those attacks came amid intelligence that suggested the group was plotting against a target in the U.S. homeland as well as other Western targets, a senior U.S. official told CNN at the time.
By all accounts, Drugeon had a very normal childhood.
Drugeon began acting out, and his grades at school nosedived.
He was part of group of about a half-dozen Salafi Muslims in the town," Pelletier told CNN.
According to Pelletier, French intelligence established that Drugeon joined a small al Qaeda subgroup known as Jund-al-Khilafah, based in the Miran Shah area.
Drugeon is believed to have left Pakistan sometime in 2013 or very early 2014, and to have traveled to Syria to join up with the Khorasan group.
