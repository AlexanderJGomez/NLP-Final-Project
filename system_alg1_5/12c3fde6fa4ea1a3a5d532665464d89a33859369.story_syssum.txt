Suze Orman says it's a good thing the federal government bailed out troubled national insurer AIG.
Suze Orman: Well, in this particular case, I have to tell you they should.
Lehman, very different.
Orman: They're selling Neuberger Berman to Barclays, that's fine.
The big downfall would have been if AIG, in my opinion, had gone under.
Nothing.
Orman: No.
On the other hand, if you're investing in a 401k every month with small amounts of money, that's OK as long as you don't need the money for 10, 15, 20 years.
What does that mean?
Orman: Yes.
Your gas bills, in terms of what you put in your cars, aren't going to be as high.
So I think they should have lowered, but they left the same.
Orman: Absolutely, they can.
