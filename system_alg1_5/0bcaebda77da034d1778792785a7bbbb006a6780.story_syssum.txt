Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said the world's most wanted terrorist is "an iconic figure" whose survival "emboldens al Qaeda as a franchising organization across the world."
"To pursue our core goal of defeating al Qaeda and preventing their return to Afghanistan, we must disrupt and degrade the Taliban's capacity, deny their access to the Afghan population, and strengthen the Afghan security forces," he said.
"I have never seen evidence that the Taliban have popular support like a political liberation movement," he said.
And Eikenberry, whose leaked cables to Washington indicated that he opposed sending large numbers of troops to the conflict, told the Senate he is "100 percent" behind the new strategy "with the refinement of the mission."
"The mission was refined, the ways forward were clarified, and the resources now have been committed to allow us to achieve the refined mission," said the ambassador, a retired general who held a senior post in Kabul before retiring from the Army.
Earlier, in his opening remarks, the general had said, "The mission is not only important, it is also achievable.
"It is a solid decision the president has made and I operate under the assumption that we will begin to decrease our forces beginning in July 2011," the general said.
"I think that, over time, that will cause the Taliban to go away, to become irrelevant, and cease to exist," he explained.
Last week, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said that Britain, Italy, Poland, Slovakia and non-NATO member Georgia are among at least 25 countries offering to send a total of 7,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
