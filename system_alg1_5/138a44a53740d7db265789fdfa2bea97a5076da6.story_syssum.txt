The 2011 Fukushima meltdown, of course, is still playing out -- but actually, so is Chernobyl.
It's now cracked, rusted and leaking radiation.
Today, Chernobyl's soil, water, and air are among the most highly contaminated on Earth.
That story is partly embodied in an unlikely community of some 130 people, called "self-settlers" who, today, live inside the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.
Of that group, the remaining women, now in their 70s and 80s, are the last survivors of a group that defied authorities -- and it would seem, common sense -- and illegally returned to their ancestral homes shortly after the accident.
Are they unaware of the risks, or crazy enough to ignore them, or both?
It's all about context.
Five happy years, the settlers logic went, is better than 15 condemned to a high-rise on the outskirts of Kyiv.
"So what."
Radioactive contamination from the accident has been death-dealing, to be sure, but relocation trauma is another, less-examined fallout of Chernobyl.
Of the old people who relocated, one Chernobyl medical technician, whose job is to give annual radiation exposure tests to zone workers  said: "Quite simply, they die of anguish."
There aren't studies to refer to (after all, semi-legal marginalized old women living on radioactive land are hardly a civic or research priority) but  surprisingly  these women who returned home have, according to local officials and journalists who have kept track of them, seem to have outlived their counterparts who accepted relocation -- by some estimates, up to 10 years.
I believe so.
And unfailingly, so do the babushkas of the Zone.
