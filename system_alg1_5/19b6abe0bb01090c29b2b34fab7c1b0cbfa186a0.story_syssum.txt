The results of the survey would, I thought, cause college-bound students and their parents to lash out in anger.
In California, Berkeley and UCLA admit fewer than 22% of their applicants.
My reaction was to see what I could learn on my own by directly contacting a handful of highly selective schools that could, if they chose, use their resources to go online and check out their applicants.
William Fitzsimmons, Harvard's influential dean of admission, emphasized that as a general practice, the college does not proactively seek online information about applicants.
As Carleton's veteran dean of admissions, Paul Thiboutot, pointed out, "We have never ignored information from any source if relevant."
On their websites and application forms, colleges should explicitly tell all prospective students that anything they write online can be held against them.
As for college-bound high school seniors, they also need to change with the times.
