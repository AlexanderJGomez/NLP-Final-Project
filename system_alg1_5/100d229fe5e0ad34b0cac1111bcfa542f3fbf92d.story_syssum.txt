The court was shown cell phone footage filmed by a witness in which a man who prosecutors said was Adebolajo, holding a bloody cleaver in his hands, spoke into the camera.
Remove your governments -- they don't care about you," he said, referring also to British Prime Minister David Cameron.
The soldier appears to have been knocked unconscious by the impact, he said.
Whittam, the prosecutor, said the defendants were armed with a meat cleaver, knives and a revolver when they got out of the car.
When police arrived at the scene, the two men moved toward their vehicle, Whittam said.
He aimed it at the officers, although it was not loaded, the prosecutor said.
While the gun carried by Adebowale was not loaded, he also had on him the bloodstained knife he'd used to attack Rigby, the prosecutor said.
Having been given morphine for the pain, he allegedly told paramedics, "Your government is all wrong.
However, the court has continued to use their given names.
Some children, returning from a school outing, had to be turned back by passersby before they saw the gory scene.
Security footage from Rigby's last train journey showed he was wearing a "Help for Heroes" hooded sweatshirt, in support of a charity that aids military veterans.
