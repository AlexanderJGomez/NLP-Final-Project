Naturally, of course, I was present, showing up casually late because it's what awesome people do at epic parties.
And, technically, everybody was invited.
OK, so maybe it's not Ibiza, but there was a popular online party hosted by the CVS Beauty Club to promote the pharmacy's cosmetic offerings via social media.
Not a joke.
Basically, I guess a Twitter party is just like any other party.
I rule!
Which, I suppose, is quite more than enough.
Minimal damage.
Maybe.
At the CVS Beauty Club, there are no initiation fees.
No dues.
Hell, go nuts!
