But in comments to media he said: "Anyway, if their aim is to strike against ISIS, it's OK."
In the short term, the international coalition's counter-terrorism strategy may certainly be in the interests of the Assad regime.
Coalition strikes have not been targeting the Syrian government's military forces or infrastructure.
More fundamentally, the coalition's anti-ISIS campaign has deflected attention from the Syrian government and armed rebel group's atrocities against civilians.
On a long term basis, the coalition strikes against ISIS in Syria will inevitably keep expanding, working to escalate the conflict.
In the end, both ISIS and Assad may be the beneficiaries of the foreign airstrikes, using them as a pretext to further advance their political interests.
