"Spain has now been victorious at every level in the United States courts, from Tampa to Atlanta to Washington," said Jim Goold, who defended Spain's claim to the treasure.
Melinda MacConnel, Odyssey's vice president and general counsel, expressed disappointment, but said she recognized that the court "rarely grants" such motions.
Spain filed suit in a federal court in Tampa, Florida, also claiming the treasure.
The appeals court is expected to send the case back to the court in Tampa, which would establish and supervise the procedures for sending the coins to Spain, Goold said last week.
Peru, too, has followed the fate of the coins, which came from Latin America when Peru was a Spanish colony.
The treasure includes fabled "pieces of eight," some minted in 1803 in Lima, Peru, Spanish officials have said.
