"The team resigned due to the Israeli illegal practices, especially settlement activities," Rabii Hantouli said in an e-mail.
Settlement building in East Jerusalem and on the West Bank is "the issue that will make or break the negotiations," he said.
"If this ends up being a real resignation this time, which again we don't know, but if it is, we expect the negotiations will continue."
Talk about expanding settlements has "rendered the peace talks irrelevant if not a total mockery," she said.
Lara Friedman, director of policy and government relations at Americans for Peace Now in Washington, said the plans had included construction in areas deep in the West Bank, east of the barrier that separates Israel from the West Bank.
