The White House has set a goal of enrolling 7 million people in private insurance plans through the new health insurance exchanges by March 31, 2014, the end of the glitch-plagued open enrollment period that started October 1.
For starters, there's no guarantee that all 700,000 will ultimately enroll in a health insurance plan.
But in many of the states operating their own exchanges, new Medicaid enrollees account for more than half of the people who have obtained insurance under Obamacare since October 1.
"In these small handful of states, they're aggressively targeting people they think might be eligible for Medicaid," Salo said.
But in a novel twist they're doing it by using Medicaid dollars to buy people private insurance on the exchanges.
But Oregon also has yet to allow online registration for private health insurance.
But with so little information from the government, it is too early to tell.
