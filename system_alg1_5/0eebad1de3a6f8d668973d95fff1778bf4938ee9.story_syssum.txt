The typhoon, known locally as "Glenda," prompted the evacuations of as many as 350,000 people from their homes in towns and cities across the country.
37 other deaths, including a family of three in Lucena city, Quezon province, were announced by the National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council (NDRRMC).
He said that, at that time, more than an inch of rain was falling per hour in the city, many areas of which are susceptible to flooding.
Half of these households, the statement adds, about 342,200 people, are poor.
As the storm passed Legazpi, James Reynolds, a freelance videographer who spent the night in the city, ventured out and saw what he described as a "community effort" to clear the fallen trees and power lines, and repair some of the property damage.
"People in this region have really been on edge since the events of Haiyan," Reynolds said.
As the storm continues on past the Philippines, conditions over the South China Sea favor intensification.
The storm is expected to brush the northern part of the Chinese island of Hainan on Friday evening local time (Friday morning ET) as a strong typhoon, likely still a Category 3.
