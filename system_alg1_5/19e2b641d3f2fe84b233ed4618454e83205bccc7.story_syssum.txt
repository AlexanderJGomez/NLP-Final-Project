Rodger's mother, Lichin, who saw the e-mail at 9:17 p.m. PT, immediately went to Rodger's YouTube page, where he had been known to post videos about himself.
According to Astaire, that's when Rodger's mother saw her son's latest video, called "Retribution," that he posted Friday, the day of the shootings.
It ended when Rodger slammed into a parked vehicle and apparently shot himself in the head, police said.
Six policemen showed up at his house in Isla Vista on April 30, but they found nothing alarming, so they told Rodger to call his mother and they reassured her that he was OK, according to Astaire.
Looking back, Rodger's parents now feel that the well-being check in April by police was a "pivotal moment," and his parents are frustrated, Astaire said.
When they left, the biggest wave of relief swept over me."
Rodger had been seeing therapists on and off since he was 8, according to Astaire.
Before his death, Rodger was seeing two therapists, Astaire added.
"Guns were never part of the dialogue," he said.
"(His parents) were conscious and concerned about their son's health," Astaire said.
"They thought he was in good hands."
