Jackson said Filner subjected her and other women to "crude and disgusting" comments and inappropriate touching.
"I had to work and do my job in an atmosphere where women were viewed by Mayor Filner as sexual objects or stupid idiots," Jackson said.
At one point, she said, someone at the event told Filner that Fink had "worked her ass off" for him.
A few days later, KPBS reported, Filner mumbled "I'm sorry" but told her she didn't understand what happened.
"I am embarrassed to admit that I have failed to fully respect the women who work for me and with me, and that at times I have intimidated them," Filner said in a statement earlier this month.
Filner "laughed it off," she said.
She said Filner challenged her to provide one example of improper behavior; when she brought up his comments about wearing underwear, "he had no comeback," she said.
