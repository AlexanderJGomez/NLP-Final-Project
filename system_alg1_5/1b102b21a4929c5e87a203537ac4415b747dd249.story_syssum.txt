Both sides agree that the ring, with its 124 diamonds, changed hands during Kraft's visit to St. Petersburg, Russia, in 2005.
Kraft did say, however, that he had wanted the ring back.
A few days after the 2005 incident, amid confusion as to whether the ring was a present or was kept by mistake, Kraft issued a statement saying it was a gift.
The 4.94-carat ring is in the Kremlin's library, where all official state gifts are kept, he said.
"He loves that the ring is at the Kremlin and, as he stated back in 2005, he continues to have great respect for Russia and the leadership of President Putin," said Stacey James, a spokesman for The Kraft Group.
There were rumors Charlie Sheen bought the ring, but the actor denied it.
