Paula Broadwell, a woman who was romantically involved with former CIA Director David Petraeus, will not face federal charges of cyberstalking another woman friendly with Petraeus.
During the investigation the FBI obtained Broadwell's computer and discovered she had classified materials.
A former Army reservist, Broadwell's security clearance was suspended after details surfaced about her possessing classified materials.
That matter was turned over to the Pentagon's inspector general for investigation.
