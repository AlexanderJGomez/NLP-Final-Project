Wenjian Liu was remembered Saturday at Aievoli Funeral Home in Brooklyn, where Mayor Bill de Blasio, Police Commissioner William Bratton, local officials and throngs of uniformed police officers and firefighters gathered at his wake in a sign of the diversity and unity of the nation's largest city.

On Saturday, several officers saluted de Blasio when he arrived at the funeral home.
"A hero's funeral is about grieving, not grievance," Bratton said.
The last display put all NYPD officers in a bad light, he said.
He expressly said there'd be no punishment for noncompliance at Liu's funeral but made sure the request was heard by all.
Liu's family came to the United States from Canton, China, in search of a better life.
Holding back tears, his father said that as a young officer, Liu once bought a meal for someone he pulled over before guiding him home, he told the Daily News.
He left behind a wife, Maritza, and two sons, Justin and Jaden.
Andrew Cuomo, de Blasio and Bratton delivered eulogies at his funeral.
