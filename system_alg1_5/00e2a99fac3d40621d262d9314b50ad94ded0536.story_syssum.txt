(CNN) -- President Abraham Lincoln and his wife, Mary Todd, needed a baby-sitter.
Very Resp.
"Charles" was Charles Forbes, a Treasury Department employee who was detailed to the Lincolns and often served as the president's valet, footman, messenger or attendant, according to the Raab Collection.
Forbes and the president's guard then left for a drink, leaving Lincoln unattended, Raab says.
"Lincoln," a film about the 16th president and his battle to end slavery, is up for 12 Academy Awards this year, including best picture.
