In about 100 days, the people of South Sudan are to vote on whether to declare independence from the government in Khartoum.
And with its referendum fast approaching, Sudan, too, faces the tyranny of the onrushing calendar.
Every dry season, herders from the North's Arab Misseriya tribes cross into what will likely become the country of Southern Sudan and then return.
Earlier this year, then-Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair told Congress that, over the next five years, Southern Sudan is the place where "a new mass killing or genocide is most likely to occur."
Even as America asks how it can help Southern Sudan prepare for the likely burdens of statehood, it must also consider the Sudan that remains.
Although the Sudanese themselves will own their future, America must now help North and South Sudan to find a peaceful path forward.
