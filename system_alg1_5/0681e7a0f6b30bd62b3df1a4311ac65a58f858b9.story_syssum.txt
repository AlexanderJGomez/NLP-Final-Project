The fatalities at the Villaggio shopping mall included seven girls, six boys, four teachers, and two other adults, the Persian Gulf monarchy's interior ministry said Monday.
Christine Wigton, an American living in Doha, told CNN she heard "a buzzer, not very loud" as she walked into the mall, but heard no loud alarms as smoke built up inside.
"There were no sprinklers, and there was nothing that would tell somebody that something was wrong," she said.
Another 17 people were injured, including four children, but most of them were firefighters, he said.
"Obviously, there are some very serious questions that will need to be answered," said Key, who did not identify the children or their parents.
