In other words, the country's reputation as a responsible international power, both in terms of domestic and foreign policy, is being undermined.
And, according to some data, this is a driver behind a decline in the country's international reputation.
This builds on earlier studies by the organization, including in 2011-12 which highlighted "intensified speculation about America's long-term stability," partly as a result of the downgrade by Standard & Poor's of the country's credit rating.
Then, as now, however, the country retains attractive qualities for many foreigners, including its popular culture and economic innovation.
While current problems should therefore be put into context, the situation is nonetheless troubling.
Thus, although House Speaker John Boehner, the Republican leader in the House of Representatives, has pledged that Washington will not default, his efforts are being undercut by more conservative colleagues.
And, this is feeding angst over the reliability of Washington as an international partner, as has been vocalized in recent days by several countries, including China, Japan and Mexico.
Republican Donald Rumsfeld asserted that "lack of leadership is sending a signal around the world that the United States is in decline, that that we're withdrawing, that we as a country are not going to behave in a rational manner."
This would not just further undermine the U.S.'s reputation as a responsible international power, but potentially send it into freefall again.
