(CNN) -- Ayman al-Zawahiri, the longtime deputy to Osama bin Laden, will take over leadership of al Qaeda, according to a statement posted on several jihadist websites Thursday.
He was indicted for his alleged role in the August 7, 1998, bombings of the United States Embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya, that killed 224 civilians and wounded more than 5,000 others, according to the National Counterterrorism Center, part of the U.S. federal government.
Paul Cruickshank, a CNN terrorism analyst, said al-Zawahiri may have a hard time following bin Laden.
"He has no sense among the work force in al Qaeda, the kind of prestige that bin Laden had."
By the 1990s, he refocused his attention on undermining and attacking the Egyptian government and, eventually, the United States.
Citing Palestinian territories, Somalia and Chechnya, the statement said al Qaeda "will remain on the path of righteousness as a coherent, solid, cemented rank, with one word that will bind us together, with hearts of affinity, and under one wholesome banner, battling one enemy.
