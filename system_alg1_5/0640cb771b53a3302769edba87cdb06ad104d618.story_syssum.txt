"There's a general feeling of a media, a judicial fury -- of a lynching," Jack Lang, France's former minister of culture and education and a Socialist Party lawmaker, told Europe 1 radio.
"The forensic evidence, we believe, will not be consistent with a forcible account, and we believe there is a very, very defensible case, and he should be entitled to bail," Brafman said during the hearing Monday.
"That is not the case in France," where cameras are not allowed in courtrooms, the head of the Socialist Party, Martine Aubry, told reporters Tuesday in Paris.
"Since yesterday we've been overwhelmed by the images and also by the charges against Dominique Strauss-Kahn," she said.
"There is a real feeling that there's a rush to justice here," said Nathan King, a correspondent for France 24 television network.
"If you are pro-Sarkozy, you are happy," French teacher Paul Verite said Tuesday.
"For the moment, we have only heard the side of the accusation, and I'm not saying that's not true, but simply that we haven't heard the opposing side and the defense's side, so I think we really have to wait for the real facts to understand what happened."
The Socialist Party's Aubry told reporters, "So far, we have only heard accusations from the prosecutor.
And we are waiting for that other voice, the one of Dominique Strauss-Kahn and his lawyers, which we will hear in the days to come."
When asked about it by reporters, King said Tuesday, that Mitterrand responded, "Yes, of course, but it's my private life."
"I think the French press knows the difference here," he said.
