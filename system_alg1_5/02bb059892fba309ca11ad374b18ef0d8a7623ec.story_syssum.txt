Tourists would revel in the lake's buoyancy (like the Dead Sea, the salt level made it impossible to sink), and the flocks of flamingos, pelicans and yellow deer that once inhabited the surrounding areas.
I saw caterpillars and bobcats taking salt from the dead body of the lake," recalls Gary Lewis, the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Iran.
"If the lake dries up, this kind of threat will not be comparable to any other threat," he said in a public statement in January.
In the year 2020, it is likely to be only 1,300 cubic meters," says Lewis.
Add in ethnic or linguistic differences, and that can be a real source of conflict," he says.
In March, Iran's Department of Environment, together with the UNDP, held a conference with hundreds of international experts on how to solve Iran's water shortage problem, and ultimately approved 24 separate projects.
"The past government would say we needed to save the lake, and would even form a national committee and ministers would come together, but there was never a budget, and without a budget, you can't do anything," says Agh.
They also approved a large amount of money, so it can really help save the lake."
