Rifqa Bary, 17, ran away from her family in Columbus, Ohio, in July.
At a court hearing Thursday in Orlando, the girl's parents denied all the allegations against them.
"We wouldn't do her harm," the father said, adding that he knew his daughter was involved with Christian organizations.
The teenager, in a sworn affidavit, claims her father, 47, was pressured by the mosque the family attends in Ohio to "deal with the situation."
Also at Thursday's hearing, the judge sealed a report on the girl from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and issued a gag order for attorneys in the case.
