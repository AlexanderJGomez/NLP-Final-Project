At least 87 bodies had been recovered, she said.
Residents from nearby villages joined in, some armed with garden tools, while others used their bare hands.
The terrain also is inaccessible by road, Ecweru said.
A select few attended the service, because of the risk of more landslides, Ecweru said.
"The villages of Nametsi, Namakansa and Kubewo in Nametsi parish have been wiped out," Ntabadde said.
The landslide occurred near Mount Elgon, on the Kenya-Uganda border.
