CNN writer Anouk Lorie relaxes in Britain's first salt cave, in Wandsworth, London.
Salt therapy claims to work by clearing the airways of mucus and reducing inflammation triggered by allergies to dust, pollen or pollution.
In the U.S., the trend has been adopted in the Chicago area with the popular Galos Cave.
Familiar with such treatments in her hometown, Sofia Benke from Hungary was therefore surprised when she moved to the UK two years ago and discovered there were no salt caves in the country.
The salt, which has no additives, is shipped in from Lithuania.
Ideally, treatment lasts one to two weeks and patients need to be in the cave for one to two hours every day, Benke says.
Dr Elaine Vickers of Asthma UK, said: "It's currently impossible for us to say whether or not salt caves are beneficial for people with asthma.
"I would never do that," she said.
