However, the police chief involved, Aziz Saud, told CNN that he suggested an autopsy be done, but that Bhutto's husband objected.
He fired three shots, then there was an explosion.
Bhutto fell into the car, then came the blast.
Bhutto's family and political party maintain that the government is lying, and insist she died from gunshot wounds.
"They are government servants who cannot speak; I am not," he said.
Cheema said the government had no objection to Bhutto's body being exhumed for an autopsy if the family requested it.
The three-page medical report, which was signed by seven doctors, described Bhutto's head wound, but it did not conclude what caused it.
