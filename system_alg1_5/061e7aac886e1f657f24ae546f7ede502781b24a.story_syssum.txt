Think of Zite, the free personalized iPad magazine that launched today, as the Genius playlist or Pandora of news discovery -- but with one noticeable advantage: Zite is smarter, at least for now.
It then culled news items from fitting sources -- Fast Company, Wired, TechCrunch, Fred Wilson's blog.
Features or analysis?
"It's a combination of semantic- and statistically based machine learning," says CEO Ali Davar, of Zite's content algorithm, the technology of which has been in development for years.
If so, does it have have a right- or left-wing slant?"
Users can select these topics on their own, but Zite is best at autosuggesting them--after playing with the app for a week, Zite began featuring "Graphic Design & Typography" as one of my top news sections.
"The difference between Flipboard and Zite is that with Zite, your sections are actually personalized," Davar says.
"On Flipboard, you pick sections and sources to customize your magazine -- that's what they call 'personalized.'
In this sense, Zite, with its endlessly fresh content culled from a wide range of media outlets, is more akin to a digital newspaper, whereas Flipboard (especially with its far sexier and sleeker design) feels more like a digital magazine.
