The game between the Georgetown team, which is in on a trip to China, and the Bayi Rockets escalated into an on-court fracas Thursday.
A day earlier, Biden watched another exhibition game between the Hoyas and another Chinese team.
The Bayi Rockets is an army team that plays in the China Basketball Association, the local professional league.
The brawl drew comments on Chinese social media, with links to video posted on Chinese websites.
In recent years, however, competition for prizes, honor and fame have sometimes trumped sportsmanship.
China's head coach, Bob Donewald, an American, along with three players and three match officials were suspended for a few games by the Federation of International Basketball Association.
