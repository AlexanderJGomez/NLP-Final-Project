From fighting terrorism to processing payments in the blink of an eye, facial recognition is set to change our ideas on privacy.
A professor at the University of Kent, Solomon has created an "electronic sketch artist" system that has changed how UK police identify criminals.
But facial recognition technology isn't always so straightforward.
"When you look at images collected from standard CCTV footage, the faces are way too small," he said in May.
According to the Sunday Times, dozens of stores and hotels are testing the technology in the U.S., the UK, and the Far East.
A Finnish company, meanwhile, aims to streamline sales by using facial recognition technology for payments.
But not everyone has embraced facial recognition with open arms.
In spite of this, Facebook recently announced plans to extend facial recognition to profile photos in other parts of the world.
