The Mississippi girl is the first child to be "functionally cured" of HIV, researchers announced Sunday.
"We didn't have the opportunity to treat the mom during the pregnancy as we would like to be able do to prevent transmission to the baby," said Dr. Hannah Gay, a pediatric HIV specialist at the University of Mississippi Medical Center.
"We started therapy as early as possible, which in this case was about 30 hours of age," the physician said.
Within a couple of days, Gay confirmed the child was HIV positive.
"One hundred percent of (HIV-positive) moms will pass those antibodies, but in the absence of treatment, only 30% of moms will transmit the actual virus," Luzuriaga told CNN.
Usually, these infants would get antiviral drugs at preventative doses for six weeks to prevent infection, then start therapy if HIV is diagnosed.
The early treatment likely led to the infant's cure, she said.
Researchers say the only other documented case of an HIV cure is that of Timothy Brown, known as the "Berlin patient."
"I've been tested everywhere possible," said Brown, who now lives in San Francisco.
Even then, some HIV experts said that doesn't matter, that he's been cured.
So far, there is no evidence of the virus.
