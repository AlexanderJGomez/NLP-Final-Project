Over a period of almost 16 years, millions of dollars intended for Holocaust survivors "instead found its way into the pockets of corrupt employees of the Claims Conference and an elaborate network of fraudsters," Bharara told reporters Tuesday afternoon.
"The Claims Conference is to be commended for notifying us as soon as they found out there were issues," he said.
"We are outraged that individuals would steal money intended for survivors of history's worst crime to enrich themselves," said Julius Berman, chairman of the Claims Conference.
It was unclear in some cases if the applicants knew that fraud was being committed, he said.
