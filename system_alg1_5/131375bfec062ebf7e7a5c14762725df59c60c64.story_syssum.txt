WARSAW, Poland (CNN) -- In Poland, it's polite to bring flowers when you visit someone's home, so there's a flower shop on virtually every street corner in Warsaw.
Modern Warsaw is a mix of shiny new skyscrapers, tree-lined boulevards, ornate prewar buildings and somber concrete communist relics.
It's part of what's known as Warsaw's Królewski Trakt, or Royal Route.
Blikle, one of the city's best-known confectioners, has been serving up cakes and pastries since 1869.
No matter the activity, it's a great place to relax and people watch.
It's here that you'll find the entrances to Warsaw's Łazienki Park, once the summer residence of Poland's royalty.
Nearby, another Warsaw tradition awaits.
"In this spot, the Nazis shot to death 30 Poles," a stone tablet reads on Nowy Świat Street.
It's not hard to do.
