On Friday, it will be a shopping mall, once again.
It was there, police say, that Roberts took his own life with a gunshot to the head.
On his Facebook page, Roberts describes himself as a "pretty funny person that takes sarcasm to the max."
"What Jake did was wrong but, as his mother, he will always be in my heart.
Roberts planned to "be a hero" and join the Marines, Tami Roberts said.
"Every day of my whole life, I was proud of him," she said.
"Please continue to keep the victims, their families and the entire community in your prayers during this difficult time," the mall said.
