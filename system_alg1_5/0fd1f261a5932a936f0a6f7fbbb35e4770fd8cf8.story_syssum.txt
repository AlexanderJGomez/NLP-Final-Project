Today, Luna and Bernal's on-screen chemistry has once again grabbed the public's attention, this time in Mexico, where their latest film "Rudo y Cursi" made box-office history.
The movie touches on fame, poverty and corruption, but for its makers, it is ultimately a tale of brotherhood.
"Originally I wanted to make a fake documentary about a footballer from a humble background who made it big and then disappeared mysteriously," Carlos Cuaron told CNN.
The company was "born out of friendship and sibling sympathies," del Toro told CNN.
Del Toro, for example, is currently in New Zealand directing Peter Jackson's follow-up to his wildly successful "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, "The Hobbit."
"I don't care about Mexican films, about indie films, about Hollywood films," says Alfonso.
"People talk about this film as if it's a comedy but I question that," says Alfonso.
"For me it's difficult," he says.
"No, not my mother," says the director.
