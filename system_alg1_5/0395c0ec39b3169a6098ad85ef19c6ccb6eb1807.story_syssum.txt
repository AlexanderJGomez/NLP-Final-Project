"It's not just a Bhutanese architectural loss but for the whole Himalayan region," Dasho Karma Ura, president of the Thimphu-based Center for Bhutan Studies, said by telephone on Tuesday before visiting the site.
Most of the dzong's sacred relics -- hundreds of them -- were saved, many of them dating back to the 6th and 7th centuries, thanks to the Bhutan armed forces, said the home minister.
"Today, it's modern facilities.
By Tuesday, only stones, which comprised the stairs before the dzong's entrance, remained of the dzong, according to the Bhutan newspaper, Kuensel, which reported that numerous administrative documents were lost.
"Dzongs are priceless," he said.
Bhutan is a very small, tiny country.
"It was one of the most magnificent sites of Bhutan -- that dzong," said Dasho Karma.
He hoped the king would rebuild the fortress, "which will inspire future generations ... in the same way that the founder of Bhutan did," he added.
