In a hearing Thursday, Judge Gerald Fisher, along with an appeals court, maintained restrictions on the media's ability to report on recent hearings in the case.
The judge's ruling was a disappointment to a group of media outlets, including Associated Press, Gannett, McClatchy, the Washington Post and Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, that had filed court papers seeking to unseal the information.
Ingmar Guandique, 31, was led into the courtroom in handcuffs and an orange jumpsuit, sporting a large tattoo that covered most of his scalp.
"This was a terrible crime of violence," said Jeffrey Toobin, CNN's senior legal analyst.
Levy, an intern with the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, disappeared in May 2001.
The Levy case generated a swarm of media coverage in 2001 and 2002, in part because it was revealed that she had had an affair with Gary Condit, then a U.S. congressman from California.
Levy's father, Robert, told CNN that the family has not been told anything regarding the recent hearings.
