"This is pretty clearly somebody manufacturing fentanyl and selling it as heroin," Williams said.
"We are working with the Allegheny County Police Department, the Pittsburgh Police, and their counterparts in the region to get this deadly mix of heroin off the streets of Western Pennsylvania, and to arrest and prosecute anyone caught selling, distributing, and producing these drugs," her statement said.
In 1988, Williams said, 17 people died when a chemist distributed fentanyl as heroin.
And in 2006, in Philadelphia, 269 people were killed by fentanyl overdoses, the state Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs said.
