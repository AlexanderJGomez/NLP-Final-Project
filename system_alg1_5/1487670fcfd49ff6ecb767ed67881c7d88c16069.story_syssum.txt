Earlier this week, European Union data watchdogs, fighting to protect our privacy in an age of big data, put pressure on Google over the privacy of user information.
But these glasses, a kind of digital surrogate for our eyes, are strange in a creepy, Hitchcockian, "Rear Window" sort of way.
Firstly, Google has done little, if anything, to inform users of this unilateral change.
But in the eyes of the EU, those of us using products like YouTube, Gmail or Google+ are being, to borrow a Microsoft coined neologism, "Scroogled" by Google's new privacy policy.
Regardless of the legitimacy of such practices, I'm strongly in favor of making Google accountable, both legally and morally, for policies that so patently disregard the privacy of its users.
When we put on these surveillance devices, we all become spies, or scrooglers, of everything and everyone around us.
According to Google co-founder Sergey Brin, quoted by tech website Mashable, "Glass will also have an automatic picture-taking mode, snapping pics at a preset intervals (such as every 5 seconds)."
And the terabytes of data sucked up every five seconds by its omniscient glasses will, of course, flow to Google.
And Google Glass could, I fear, become the focal point for all our data in a world where privacy no longer exists.
A pooling of all our most intimate data, a mirror of ourselves -- the holy grail, of course, for advertisers.
After all, when we wear these devices, those clever engineers at Google will know where we are all the time.
To qualify, well-heeled Google fanboys need to go to their Google+ or Twitter accounts and, in 50 words or less, using the hashtag #ifihadglass, explain how they would use Google Glass.
No, Google Glass must be opaque.
