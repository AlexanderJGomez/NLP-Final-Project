Apartments at 302 Mott Street in Manhattan, where the four were arrested, are part of the investigation into Hoffman's death, according to a police source.
Police discovered the largest amount of what is believed to be heroin in his apartment, the source said.
"He used to practice at night," said the former neighbor, recounting that Vineberg played keyboards.
"These charges have absolutely nothing to do with Philip Seymour Hoffman's unfortunate death," Kratt said.
Also found in Hoffman's apartment was his personal journal, resting on a living room TV stand, two law enforcement sources said.
While results of an autopsy will definitively reveal exactly how Hoffman, 46, died, the role that heroin may or may not have played is a key part of the investigation.
On Tuesday,  a law enforcement source told CNN that the night before Hoffman died, he withdrew $1,200 from a grocery store ATM near his  apartment.
Fear, Hoffman said, made him sober up.
It really was, it was just that," he said.
And at that point, he took off his hat and he said, 'I'm a heroin addict,'" Arundel said.
"I mean, there's no way to explain it."
His skin color was very pale, but he wasn't disheveled as some media was reporting," Barrett told CNN.
"I just was really profoundly affected by his death and felt like it was important for me to be here," said Leslie Kritzer, a fellow actor.
"He could do the movies, and he did them brilliantly -- better than anyone else -- but he always came back to his roots and he was a hero for all of us that could only dream of doing what he accomplished," she said.
