BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- Thailand's Constitutional Court Tuesday fired the country's prime minister, Samak Sundaravej, for violating the constitution by hosting a TV cooking show while in office.
His work for the television company, he said, was as a freelancer and not an employee.
I said, 'No, I checked the constitution already.
In addition, thousands of protesters have camped outside the Government House, the government's headquarters -- blocking Samak from entering since August 26.
They accuse him of being a proxy for his ousted predecessor, Thaksin Shinawatra.
Thaksin, who was ousted in a coup in 2006, returned to England last month just as he was to appear in court in a corruption case.
