They may want to take a page from Finland, which is considered to have one of the leading education systems in the world.
For some, education in Finland is utopia: a dreamland where teaching is the most desired profession, authorities trust schools and political parties agree on the direction of educational reforms.
First, Finland has built a school system that has over time strengthened educational equity.
Schooldays are also shorter in Finland than in the United States, and primary schools keep the homework load to a minimum so students have time for their own hobbies and friends when school is over.
But even if this were true, it would not explain why in Finland students learn better in their schools than in most other places in the world.
Second, American education places too much faith in marketplace choice, which parents have because of expanded access to charter schools.
The United States can't become Finland, but there is a lot it can learn about what works and what doesn't.
When poverty explains up to half of student achievement, schools must have measures to better cope with the harmful consequences that disadvantaged family backgrounds have on teaching and learning in many schools.
