More than a hundred detainees went through the CIA's detention program, and about a third were subjected to "enhanced interrogation techniques," which included waterboarding, exposure to cold temperatures, slapping and sleep deprivation.

"There's going to be nothing lost in this narrative," the official added.
A Senate aide said the purpose of the report wasn't to point fingers at the Bush administration, but to examine the program itself.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee and is usually a defender of the CIA, has unleashed stinging criticism of the agency after what she said was a series of cover-ups including the destruction of interrogation tapes.
During the call, Kerry made it clear "that the timing is of course her choice,"  Psaki  said.
Ali Soufan, a former FBI agent, who was one of the bureau's top al Qaeda experts, says the torture "didn't work."

I understand why it happened.
