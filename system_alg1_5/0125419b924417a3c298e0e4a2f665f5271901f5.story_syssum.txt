(CNN) -- American investigators reviewing a hard drive belonging to the captain of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 have found that there were deletions of information even closer to the final flight than first indicated by Malaysian officials, U.S. law enforcement officials tell CNN.
More couldn't be learned about the nature of the deletions, and who made them.
Investigators have focused on the pilots because of the lack of any other information.
U.S. investigators have compiled profiles of the two pilots, based on interviews with friends, neighbors and family members conducted by Malaysian investigators, and on a search of their online activities, U.S. officials say.
U.S. officials say they understand that there are Malaysian legal restrictions and requirements for probable cause before such searches.
