(CNN)  -- "LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean" holds fast to the pirate code with great humor and animation, appeal for all ages and massive replayability after the main story mode is complete.
Matt Ellison, associate producer at Traveller's Tales Games, said 70 characters can be unlocked and bought throughout the entire game.
For example, Captain Barbossa is often seen with an apple in his hand.
"A lot of time went into making sure we got Jack's running right, his character right," Ellison said.
Plus we wanted to make a distinctive change of pace between the levels, so you are treasure hunting in one level, and then fighting foes in the next."
Ellison said each scene has to be solvable for all ages, and the game teaches you what to do and where to look as it goes along.
As I said, the fourth movie is also included, so I was worried about spoiling my future enjoyment.
We do have some of the action from the movie, but it shouldn't ruin the film for anyone," he said.
My co-op player and I found it confusing and, at times, frustrating to figure out where we needed to go or what we needed to do unless we were on the same screen.
After a while, it just gave me a headache.
The game is also available for the Nintendo 3DS, but there are only 16 levels, and you can use only one character during each level.
"LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean" is now available in the U.S. and, as of Friday, in Europe.
It is available on the PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Nintendo 3DS, and PSP.
