Republicans must be prepared to not only keep the Senate in 2016, but also build a foundation that will preserve their majority for the next several cycles.
It's an exciting moment for the GOP because it can showcase its policies.
For the first time in eight years, Republicans will have the chance to demonstrate that they are the party of common sense ideas, because they will run the entire show on Capitol Hill.
Time is not on the GOP's side.
Yes, there will be several high-profile senators who will be positioning themselves for a presidential run, but the focus of House-Senate efforts must not change because of them.
Immigration, however, remains the elephant in the room for Republicans.
That talking point will no longer exist under Republican control.
The election victory is theirs to build upon, or lose again very shortly.
