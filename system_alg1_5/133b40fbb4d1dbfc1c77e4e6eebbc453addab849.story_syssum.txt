Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)After days of turmoil and talks of a coup in Yemen, the government and Houthi rebels reached a tentative deal Wednesday.
One government minister called it "the completion of a coup," but rebels said they had not asked the president to step down.
But the deal inked Wednesday could signal a return to stability, said Mohammed Albasha, a spokesman for the Yemeni Embassy in Washington.
Parts of the government (were) dysfunctional, but we did not reach the point of no return," he told CNN's "The Situation Room."
Under the agreement, the Houthis would withdraw from all of these sites.
In the past, timelines were not respected, who hope this time will be different," a member of the Houthi Political council said.
For days, the answers to questions about who's in charge of the country have varied, depending on who you ask.
Besides the confusion about who is at the helm in Yemen, the rebels seized military installations it says it will return under the agreement.
The installation is not under control of the rebels, but they have it surrounded, the field commanders and two government officials said.
