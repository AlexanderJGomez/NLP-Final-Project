Breivik has pleaded not guilty, though he has admitted carrying out the attacks, according to the judge handling his case previously.
The Tuesday report said Breivik was not psychotic at the time of the crimes, does not suffer from a psychiatric condition and is not mentally challenged.
If he is convicted, his punishment will be based on the determination of his sanity.
He insists nobody could believe that he was insane, and describes questions about his mental condition as ridiculous, his attorney, Geir Lippestad, has said.
