Fossett was last seen in early September, flying a single-engine plane on a pleasure flight from a Nevada ranch.
At 3 p.m., when he had not returned, a search began that ultimately included thousands of volunteers.
"Given the timeline and the sighting of Fossett's plane, I believe he was within 20 to 25 miles of the ranch when he crashed," Rains said.
In the search for Fossett, wreckage from eight other crashes was discovered, one of them from the 1960s, the lawyers said.
