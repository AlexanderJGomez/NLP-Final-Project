He stood trial with 14 co-defendants, including some of his presidential staff.
Morsy, who became Egypt's first democratically elected President in June 2012, was deposed by a popularly backed military coup in July 2013.
"This, in fact, was the maximum sentence for the charges.
This case is a manifestation of this," she said.
"Sentencing the president won't pass," he said.
He praised the "neutrality of the court," rebuffing accusations of politicization.
Consequently, we will appeal this sentence," he told CNN.
He is also standing trial in three other cases, including two on charges of espionage.
In May, Morsy is scheduled to start a fifth trial -- this one on charges of insulting the judiciary.
