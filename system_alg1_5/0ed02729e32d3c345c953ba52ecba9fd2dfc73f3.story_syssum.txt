(CNN) -- Syria's civil war has been grinding on for nearly two years now, resulting in the deaths of more than 60,000 people, according to estimates from the office of the U.N. Human Rights Commissioner.
CNN's Nic Robertson and Nick Paton Walsh, who have reported from inside Syria, analyze the conflict and what the future may hold.
And, of course, it boosts morale for the rebels as well.
So perhaps what we're seeing is the regime entering a new phase now where, rather than fight to hold on to everything, they're fighting to have a better negotiating position in the future.
You'll see pockets of these regime forces, particularly in the north, being left to their own devices.
I think there's an optimism, perhaps amongst many Syrians, that they are educated, moderate in terms of the Islamic values they have.
But that will be the moment when Syria needs help at its most.
Robertson: The economy in Syria is completely destroyed, and it's going to take years to rebuild.
Paton Walsh: I think once the majority of the violence ends, once the nuts and bolts of the civil war are behind them, then food, utilities will come back reasonably quickly because of the nature of where Syria is and who it's bordered by.
... Any sort of sense of these opposition groups want to coalesce around democracy, those are not the indications we have at the moment.
The distrust of the United States and Europe is deep-rooted in the culture in Syria already from 40 years of Assad rule, from watching what's happened in other Arab countries, from hearing what radical Islamists say what the West is trying to do with Islam.
I don't think we're going to find friends quickly in Syria.
