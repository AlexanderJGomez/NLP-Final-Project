Debbie Rowe, Jackson's ex-wife and mother of his two oldest children, has not publicly revealed whether she will challenge Katherine Jackson, his 79-year-old mother, for custody or visitation rights.

"He was upset because he really wanted to be a dad," Rowe said.
I want to do this.
You need to be a dad, and I want you to be.'"
Rowe gave up parental rights to Jackson in 2001, but she changed her mind more than two years later and sought temporary custody of the children.
"That was my request, not his," she said.
"It's not that they're not my children, but I had them because I wanted him to be a father," she said.
"Debbie doesn't run out to all of the social events," he said.
she replied, as she walked through the swarm.
"She doesn't react well with the paparazzi," he said.
"The Post stands by its story," New York Post Editor-in-Chief Col Allan told CNN.
