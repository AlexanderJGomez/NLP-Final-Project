Sarah Palin, Wasilla, Alaska's former mayor, is under fire for a sports complex she fought hard for.
"She really was very, very passionate about this right from the start," Wasilla Recreation Manager Bruce Urban said.
"When they started building, the title to the land was in my name," said Lundgren, who now lives in Panama.
In 2002, a federal court sided with Lundgren, finding that the city had never signed the proper papers.
Attorney Kenneth Jacobus, who represented the city, said he had no recollection of an acceptable offer from Lundgren.
Palin's successor as mayor, Diane Keller, said the project has brought in more than $3 million in revenue for local businesses.
It may have been a part of Sarah Palin's dream, but it wasn't only her dream," Keller said.
