A 17-year-old male was charged Saturday as an adult with aggravated assault and other charges over a shooting the previous day at a Philadelphia high school, police said.
He faces aggravated assault, violation of Pennsylvania's Uniform Firearms Act, recklessly endangering another person, having a weapon on school property "and other related charges," according to the police spokesman.
They were taken to a local hospital, police said, and their wounds are not life-threatening.
The school went into lockdown as law enforcement officers searched students and let them out of the school, said Stanford.
They later released the 15-year-old male, who was "completely cleared by investigators," Stanford said.
"People send their kids to school; they shouldn't have to pick them up at the hospital," he said.
