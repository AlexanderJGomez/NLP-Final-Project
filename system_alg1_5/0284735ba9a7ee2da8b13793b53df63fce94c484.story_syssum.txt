Joel Osteen: Well, I think he's doing a great job.
She stepped up, and she's done a remarkable job.

I believe he is a Christian.
Joel Osteen: It's a living translation of the Bible, which is an easy version to read.
King: Supposing there were more states that had it.
Joel Osteen: I think that, again, it's best for a male and a female.
Joel Osteen: Yeah, exactly.
But I think God's best is a male and female.
Joel Osteen: I'm trying to think where he's coming from.
Joel Osteen: Well, he's a smart man and I respect him.
Joel Osteen: You know, it's really sad.
King: Do you pray for them, Victoria?
Victoria Osteen: Oh, absolutely.
So yeah, we do pray for them.
... You don't have anything to live for.
Joel Osteen: Well, it's difficult.
But it's amazing the peace that God gave me.
Joel Osteen: I believe he's in heaven.
And I believe that our spirit's on the inside.
