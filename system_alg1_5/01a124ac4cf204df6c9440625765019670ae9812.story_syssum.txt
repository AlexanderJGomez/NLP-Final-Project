Under West Virginia law, the state's popular two-term Democratic governor, Joe Manchin, has the power to appoint Byrd's successor.
West Virginia law fails, however, to state exactly when a vacancy occurs.
Whether the vacancy is considered to have been created at the moment of Byrd's death, or when the Senate informs state officials of the vacancy, or when Manchin declares the seat vacant will be crucial.
He scaled the summit of power, but his mind never strayed from the people of his beloved West Virginia.
"Sen. Byrd was a fearless fighter for the constitution, his beloved state and its great people.
I looked up to him, I fought next to him, and I am deeply saddened that he is gone.
Because of his enduring virtue, he will be remembered as one of them.
... We are glad to know that Senator Byrd and his beloved Erma are reunited.
He was a symbol of West Virginia, he was an outstanding senator, and he was extraordinary American."
