"Jonah has done great things for New Zealand and the All Blacks sevens and I don't really like being compared to him," Ione told CNN's Rugby Sevens Worldwide show.
New Zealand sevens coach Gordon Tietjens recently described Ioane as someone with "all the attributes and skill set of a fine rugby player," albeit on a sharp learning curve.
"Back in high school I used to have pies every day, McDonald's whenever we were out, but now with the sevens it's a lot different.
Turning out in the Japanese capital, however, was a special moment for Ioane, who spent much of his early childhood in the city.
So, two Japanese names and I guess it's special," he said.
"They're proud but they also want me to have an education outside of rugby, balancing sport and study and just making sure that I don't fall behind in classes and things like that," said Ioane.
"I've enjoyed it, even though it's hard and I've struggled sometimes, it's what you have to do to be a professional rugby player," he said.
