The Paris court upheld the five-year sentence with two years suspended that was handed down in October 2010, Kerviel's lawyer, David Koubbi, said.
If Kerviel's conviction were overturned, it could once more raise questions about the bank's role in the scandal.
"The banks are the ones to blame for the banking system and the systematic economic crisis, not Jerome Kerviel," he said.
Koubbi lamented that "despite the new elements added to his defense," Kerviel's appeal had failed.
Societe Generale, which said it discovered the losses in January 2008, said that at no time were supervisors aware of Kerviel's alleged unlawful activities.
