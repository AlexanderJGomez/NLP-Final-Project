This ultra-illustrative, chronological listing of posts, photos, shared links, check-ins, and more is a radically different arrangement than the Facebook profile you've been used to.
1.
To hide a Timeline element, click the pencil icon at the top of the offending post, then choose "Hide from Timeline."
If you prefer to keep your profile public, but don't want everyone to see what you posted back in high school, for example, you can also tweak your Timeline settings more generally.
These events aren't listed on your Timeline, but they can be.
First, you can add a cover to your Timeline.
Toward the top of your profile, above the buttons where it says "Update Info," you should see "Add a Cover."
Conversely, you can click the star on a maximized featured post to make it normal again.
On your Timeline, click "Activity Log."
You can choose to see only your posts, posts by others, posts from specific Facebook apps ("Hmm, let's look at my past Farmville accomplishments"), photos and more.
You can change it to "Only Important" updates or "All updates," and you can also filter what types of posts you're interested in seeing: things like life events, status updates, or photos.
Just go to the left-hand side of your Newsfeed page, click "More," and toward the bottom you'll see "Lists."
One last thing: If you're one of those people who's still into "poking" your friends, you can still do that.
