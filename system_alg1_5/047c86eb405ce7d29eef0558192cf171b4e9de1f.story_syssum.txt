"My name is Umar but you can call me Farouk," the poster continues, detailing biographical information that appears to match the life of Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, the 23-year-old Nigerian man accused of attempting to detonate an explosive on an international flight into Detroit, Michigan, on Christmas Day.
"I will describe myself as very ambitious and determined, especially in the deen," Farouk1986 wrote in February 2005, referring to the Islamic way of life.
"First of all, I have no friend[s]," he wrote in another online post with informal, imperfect grammar.
Part of the explosive device that failed to take down last week's flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, was sewn into AbdulMutallab's underwear, authorities said.
One of his struggles, the poster wrote, was that the "loneliness leads me to other problems."
His religion instructed him to fast to avoid such temptation, but it didn't seem to be working, Farouk1986 said.
