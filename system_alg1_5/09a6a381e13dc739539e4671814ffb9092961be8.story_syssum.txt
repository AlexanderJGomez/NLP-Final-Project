As it approaches, I am reminded how disappointed and hurt I used to be when my stepdaughter didn't acknowledge me on this day.
Also, I hate pretense, and I felt that he was pressuring me to accept his view of our happy family unit.
Thankfully, my feelings have changed and, now I am in a better place where I accept and understand why my stepdaughter will not reach out to me on Mother's Day.
If stepmothers weren't so unhappy, the divorce rate for second marriages, as high as 60% to 75%, might be reduced.
From these three venues, I gained a lot of information about the specific problems stepmothers encounter.
Without a doubt, knowing that I wasn't alone, that there were other stepmothers struggling to find their rightful place in their new families just like me, was the best medicine to heal my pain.
These women also helped me understand that my desire to be acknowledged by my stepdaughter on Mother's Day was not unreasonable, but it might be too much for her to give me.
I respect my stepdaughter's love for her mother, and never want her to feel any loyalty binds.
While my husband used to encourage my stepdaughter to wish me a Happy Mother's Day, she is an adult, and he can't control her actions.
I have learned that when I focus my energy on her, I feel good.
By choosing to do positive activities on Mother's Day, we take responsibility for our happiness.
