(CNN) -- Kim Jong Un, successor to his father's dictatorship over North Korea, will have to find ways to balance political factions and generate revenue -- or he may not remain in power for long, analysts said Tuesday.
North Korea does not function as a "normal nation state" through imports, exports and taxes, Park said.
"The way to view Kim Jong Un is almost as a CEO of North Korea Inc.," Park said.
North Koreans "know much more about the world than they did" when Kim Jong Il came to power, said Caryl, who last visited a few years ago.
"There are different factions and interest groups," Caryl said.
Still, "some experts doubt that Kim's death will lead to chaos," Bajoria writes, noting that the country has shown resilience in the past.
Depending on the balance between the new people that support Kim Jong Un and the older generation that upheld Kim Jong Il, things may not necessarily go smoothly within the leadership," he said.
