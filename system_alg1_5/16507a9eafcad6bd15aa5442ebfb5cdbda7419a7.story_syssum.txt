"Romney's discussion of his promotion of women in his gubernatorial administration was ... problematic," said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta.
"First, Romney's description of how he found female appointees sounded an awful lot like affirmative action, and someone will bring this up again.
During the debate at Hofstra University in New York, Romney, who worked in business before serving as governor of Massachusetts, said he "learned a great deal" about the inequalities between men and women in the workplace when leading his state.
Before the debate ended, there were Twitter hashtags and handles, a series of memes on Tumblr, and a Facebook page with over 100,000 fans.
"The gap between Obama and Romney was declining and I'm not sure ... if the governor made significant headway (with women voters)," said Meena Bose, director of the Peter S. Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra.
After the debate, Democratic pundits criticized Romney's efforts to hire women.
Socarides gave Romney points for trying to hire women but said in doing so, "Romney demonstrates that he's living in another world."
Romney campaign surrogate Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, said one reason more women may be looking to vote for Romney is because of his economic message.
