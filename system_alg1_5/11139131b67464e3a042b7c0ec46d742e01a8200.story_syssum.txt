"I was crying watching the news," said Penaflorida, the 2009 CNN Hero of the Year.
Hendley, who has responded to humanitarian crises in Darfur, Haiti and Syria, had just started assessing how his nonprofit, Wine to Water, might help the Philippines when he received Penaflorida's e-mail.
"That was a long trip from the U.S. to the Philippines ... and he has put out his own money and resources to help us," Penaflorida said.
"We were both excited, seeing each other."
"When we got to the communities, they were asking for help," he said.
"There's too much we have to do."
The country's minister of education has expressed strong interest in the large-scale replication of the program, Penaflorida said, and asked him to assess the feasibility during his visit.
Unexpectedly, Hendley and Penaflorida ran into Lim as they traveled from Manila, an impromptu Heroes reunion of sorts.
Evans Wadongo, a Top 10 CNN Hero in 2010, is also hoping to partner with Penaflorida.
"CNN Heroes are like family, and I'm glad that my fellow Heroes have immediately responded," he said.
