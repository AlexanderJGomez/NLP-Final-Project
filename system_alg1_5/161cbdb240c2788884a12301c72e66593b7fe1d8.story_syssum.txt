Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib, head of the Syrian National Coalition, met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of an international security conference in Munich, Germany, Russia's state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported.
Russia has criticized Western powers, including the United States, that have recognized the opposition as Syria's rightful leadership.
The opposition chief said the group was open to talks, but not in Russia.
The carnage continued Saturday, as at least 101 people were killed, the opposition said.
