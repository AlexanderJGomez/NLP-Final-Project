MADRID, Spain (CNN)  -- A car bomb exploded Friday morning in Spain's northern Basque region, killing a police officer inside the vehicle, officials said.
"ETA showed us the road to pain," Lopez said on national TV.
"My stance to stop ETA is unbreakable, so that people in the Basque country and Spain can live in peace, to halt this barbarity," said Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, after the attack.
ETA has threatened Lopez, who is a socialist and the first non-nationalist Basque president in 30 years.
