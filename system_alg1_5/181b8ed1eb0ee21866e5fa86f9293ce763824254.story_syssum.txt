Donny and Marie Osmond are guests on Monday's "Piers Morgan Tonight."
I look at Justin Bieber ... and my heart breaks for him, because I know what he's going to go through.
"They didn't look at it as being a celebrity," Marie said.
And that's what I learned from Sammy Davis Jr., from Frank Sinatra, is when you went to ... those shows, you got to know them."
He could do no wrong.
"The king of rock and roll just walked through the door, and he's a real person," said Donny.
"I was recording an album.
It's out.
And that's my song to my husband, Steve."
"There's always a place that is set in your heart at the dinner table," said Marie.
"There's always a celebration when he's there."
