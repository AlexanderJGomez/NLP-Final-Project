Gas prices have drivers reconsidering what they drive, but some SUV owners say they have no real alternative.
Toyota's hybrid sedan just wouldn't work, said Sharp, 36.
"These higher gasoline prices are changing consumer behavior, and rapidly," Wagoner said.
Stephanie Torgerson, 32, of Pataskala, Ohio, said she simply can't put her three boys in her husband's Mazda 626.
"I don't want to be labeled as a soccer mom," she said.
She spends about $82 a week on gas, she said.
Orlando Tapia, of Cabot, Arkansas, said he considered trading in his 2001 Chevy Suburban to buy his wife a new car.
Tapia has felt the pinch of high gas prices, he said, but he has ways to alleviate the burden on his wallet without hocking his truck or SUV.
"If I'm running to the store and the Camry's out there and the Suburban and pickup are out there, I definitely jump in the Camry," he said.
"I've got several of these things that I've been pouring liquid gold in the tank of," said Mark Antley, 47, of Sharpsburg, Georgia.
He has already put 5,000 miles on it, which has saved him about the cost of the car in gas, he said.
All products go up in price, he said.
"There will still be a niche market for them," he said.
