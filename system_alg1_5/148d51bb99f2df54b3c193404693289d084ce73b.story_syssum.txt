The mayor's father, Octavio Garcia Suarez, 59, of Nogales, also was indicted and arrested.
He faces several charges that include fraud, theft and money laundering, the attorney general's statement indicated.
At least one business admitted to the FBI that it was paying the mayor to use his official position to obtain business contracts and, specifically, to obtain new city of Nogales contracts, the attorney general stated.
The mayor's father, Garcia Suarez, was an agent for Western Union authorized to sell Western Union money orders from his money transmitter business, ACE Cash Express, in Nogales, officials said.
Of the $3.2 million, the father and son withdrew $565,000 for their personal use before the account was frozen, it said.
