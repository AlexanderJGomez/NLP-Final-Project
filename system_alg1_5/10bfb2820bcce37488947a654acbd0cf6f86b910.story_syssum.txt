In a report released Saturday, the group ranks nations using the "Happy Planet Index," which seeks countries with the most content people.
The Central American country, tucked between Nicaragua and Panama, touts its lush rain forests and pristine beaches.
Other populous nations, such as China and India, had a lower index brought on by their vigorous pursuit of growth-based models, the survey suggested.
The report, which was first conducted in 2006, covers 99 percent of the world population, the statement said.
