Rivera Gracias is accused of killing Richard Limon, 69, in August 2011.
According to the FBI, Limon was a long-tme family acquaintance of Rivera Gracias' teenage girlfriend.
Rivera Gracias was added to the FBI's Top 10 list on March 14 and at that time law enforcement officials said they believed he had fled to his native country.
In Wednesday's announcement the FBI said "further reward information will not be made public."
Alleged Boston mob figure James "Whitey" Bulger spent more than a decade on the list and ultimately was captured in June 2011 in Santa Monica, California.
