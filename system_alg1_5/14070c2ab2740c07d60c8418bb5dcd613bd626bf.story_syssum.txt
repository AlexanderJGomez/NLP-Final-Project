A school district outside Columbus, Ohio, is on track to receive more than $1 million in federal grant money for its Chinese arts and language program.
"We owe it to our students so they can be a successful part of the world," said Hank Langhals, coordinator for pupil services.
The nonprofit Asia Society works, in many instances, with the Chinese government to help secure new Confucius Classrooms and relationships.
"We feel very lucky that we have this," Aldis said.
"It's really been challenging," she said.
"I actually have a few friends that are hateful towards the language and the culture, maybe because it's different," he said.
"The objection ... was not to the teaching of a foreign language," said John Kramar, the district's former superintendent and a vocal opponent of the proposal.
School administrator Hank Langhals stressed that a relationship, however small, between China and the United States will be mutually beneficial in the long run.
"We don't agree with everything, how the system works in China, but hopefully as it opens more and more, which it certainly has, they will become more democratic, they will become more open with less censorship, so you hope that's all there," Langhals said.
And I think everybody could use that."
