Colombia's 2-1 defeat of Ivory Coast means that the South Americans will definitely go through to the knockout stage of the competition, regardless of the results of their final group match next week, against Japan.
If two teams have the same number of points, the one with the greater goal difference is ahead, so -- for example -- Costa Rica's 3-1 victory over Uruguay puts them at the top of Group D, while Italy's 2-1 victory over England is good enough for second.
Its teams are, as a whole, the highest ranking in the World Cup, with Uruguay ranked seventh in the world, Italy ninth, England 10th and Costa Rica 28th.
The other two teams in the group, Ecuador and Honduras, both lost their first matches and have no points, so they both have to fight for a big win to have much hope of going through.
