Both men, U.S. military veterans, served in Iraq -- and both, according to authorities and those who knew them, returned home changed men after their combat service.
"You're going to see this more and more over the next 10 years," said Shad Meshad, founder of the National Veterans Foundation, who has been working with veterans since 1970.
Barnes was emotionally unstable, vindictive and anger-prone, the woman said, and owned many knives and guns.
A friend of his, who asked to be identified only as Brian, told CNN Monday that "something happened" after Campo returned from Iraq.
It's important to note, experts said, that the two cases represent the extreme end of a spectrum of behavior signifying difficulties faced by returning troops, and some experience little difficulty, if any.
"It's embedded in (the service member) to do that," Meshad said.
"It looks brutal, it is brutal, it's horrible, it's heinous, but they switch on like that because they haven't been switched off."
"Big boys don't cry," he said.
"I'm not seeing everybody out there," he said.
Absent that support, some vets may not take that step, he said.
They come home "full of war energy ... and it's hard for them to have a relationship with anybody other than somebody in your unit," Meshad said.
While the Marines do have a program, he said, many troops don't listen; those who do have said it's "oversimplified."
