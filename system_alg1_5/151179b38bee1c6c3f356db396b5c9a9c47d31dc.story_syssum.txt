Guy Heinze Sr., 46, was granted the award by the McIntosh County, Georgia, Magistrate Court in a suit over a mobile home that he owned, court officials said.
Heinze's son, Guy Heinze Jr., 22, faces eight counts of first-degree murder in the deaths.
Police also are aware of it, Glynn County Police Chief Matt Doering said, but he declined comment on whether it is being explored as a possible motive in the slayings.
Heinze called 911 to report the slayings, telling the dispatcher, "My whole family is dead."
Family members said he was on his way to attend the visitation for the victims but was arrested before arriving.
A police chaplain called relatives to tell them of the arrest, family members said.
A ninth victim, a 3-year-old, was on life support at a Savannah, Georgia, hospital as of Saturday, her grandmother said.
Brunswick is about 300 miles southeast of Atlanta on Georgia's Atlantic coast.
