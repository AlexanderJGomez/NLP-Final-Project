Marsalis grew up in New Orleans, Louisiana, son of Dolores and Ellis Marsalis.
The blues is our root music, American born-and-bred, but it's been treated like a stepchild of dubious origin, granted only secondary status, in Marsalis' view.
That's jazz, country and R&B.
It's in New Orleans music, it's in jazz, it's in country music, it's in gospel.
The other is the down-home sensibility that's sophisticated.
[It was] basically the same music, so there was an intersection point.
MARSALIS: It came from who we didn't like.
Who it came from, we did not like them.
That's a long time.
But it's not going to go away, it was too many people.
In the aftermath of slavery ... there was a retrenching, and [it turned into] the type of racism that was experienced by people who came to the North.
MARSALIS: The blues was like a solution to that, an antidote to it.
MARSALIS: It is America.
MARSALIS: We have to have an overall cultural objective, which we don't have.
It's very simplistic.
If you don't really want to swing or play with the musicians, there's nothing they can do, because you have the freedom to destroy it.
From him.
What he did was very clear, and what he thought about being a man, he didn't look at a boy like that.
Philosophically, he knew more than we did.
I never thought I knew more than him, he was on the case.
