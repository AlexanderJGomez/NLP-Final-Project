One man dominated the headlines, peddling optimism: India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
After all, hope can only go so far.
He spent much of the year in campaign mode, in India and abroad.
By year-end, prices had halved.
India's government will look to use that money well.
In any case, India needs much more money and investment, likely from abroad.
Can he really, as his government has promised, improve India's ranking for doing business from a dismal 142nd in the world to somewhere in the top 50?
He will begin 2015 basking in the glow of receiving President Barack Obama, the chief guest at India's Republic Day, on January 26.
And what will he do if, in a big global crisis, he is pushed to choose sides between any of Russia, China and the United States?
On domestic issues, a year ago, Modi was known outside India mostly for his inability -- or worse, apathy -- in stopping one of the worst religious riots in modern Indian history, when some 2,000 Muslims were killed in Gujarat, the state he ran at the time.
In 2015, Modi will need not only to be a voice of reason, but he will also have to rein in radical fringe elements of his Hindu support base.
Beyond politics, from living and reporting in India, I am hopeful about this country's future.
The pace of technology adoption, coupled with faster and cheaper hardware, will transform India in ways we are only just beginning to comprehend.
This will be India's real revolution, and it is already underway.
