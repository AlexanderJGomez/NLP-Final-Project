The Islamic State terror group is now "a credible alternative to al Qaeda" that is "expanding its presence" with foreign fighters returning from Syria, and possibly Iraq, to their home countries, a U.S. intelligence official said Thursday.
Still, they "see conflict with the United States as inevitable," the official said.
While it currently has funds from taking over oil facilities and other operations in Iraq, the United States believes that will not be enough to sustain ISIS if it tries to seize the entire country, the official said.
The thinking is as momentum slows, ISIS will be "under more pressure, reality sets in," the official said.
