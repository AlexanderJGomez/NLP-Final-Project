A controversial new Texas law requiring voters to present personal identification before going to the polls has been blocked by the Obama administration.
The Justice Department, relying on statistics provided by the state, said Hispanics in particular would be negatively affected by the Texas law.
Thus, we conclude that the total number of registered voters who lack a driver's license or personal identification card issued by (the state Department of Public Safety) could range from 603,892 to 795,955," Perez said in the letter, addressed to the director of elections for the Texas secretary of state.
Voters in the state would be required to present one of seven types of government-issued photo identification, including a driver's license, a passport or a concealed handgun permit.
Texas and other jurisdictions have chafed at the requirements, saying there has been no recent government effort to discriminate.
"Texas' voter ID law would prevent countless Latinos, African-Americans, elderly citizens and others from casting their ballot," said Katie O'Connor, a staff attorney with the ACLU's Voting Rights Project.
The Supreme Court in January ordered a special federal court in Texas to reconsider its rejection of the maps approved by the state's Republican majority.
