Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, told CNN affiliate MTV that he favored strong government intervention against Bakonyi's aluminum company, MAL Co.
Military trucks and cars used to decontaminate the area came through the streets, spraying away the dark red dust that accumulates.
Meanwhile, an eighth victim of the sludge has been found, said Gyorgyi Tottos, an official with Hungary's emergency services department.
"We know that it will happen," she said, although when is unknown.
If the wall collapses, 500,000 cubic meters of toxic red sludge could spill out.
Orban, the prime minister, who was visiting the stricken area Saturday, said it was "very likely" the reservoir wall will collapse.
The sludge from last Monday's spill reached Europe's mighty Danube river Thursday, raising fears of wider contamination in Hungary and countries downstream, including Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania and the Ukraine.
But, she said, it's too soon to tell what those effects might be.
The aluminum company, MAL Co., said in a statement Saturday it was doing its utmost "to avoid further damages and to reinforce the injured deposit."
"Behind this tragedy, some human errors and mistakes must exist," he said.
