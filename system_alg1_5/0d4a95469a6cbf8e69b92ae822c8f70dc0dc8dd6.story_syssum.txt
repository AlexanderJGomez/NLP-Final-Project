At a ceremony at the national stadium, survivors of the genocide recounted their memories of the killings and of their survival.
Some, sobbing and overcome with emotion, were carried outside.
The French Foreign Ministry said that France was "surprised by the recent accusations made by the Rwandan president" and that Justice Minister Christiane Taubira, who had been due to travel to Kigali on Monday, would no longer attend the commemoration.
"When I came out, I found the people we had committed crimes against, be it the mother of this boy (Rafiki) or this boy himself," Musa said.
"I never had a chance to bury my parent, as his child, in a decent way," Rafiki said.
The violence was triggered by the death of President Juvenal Habyarimana, an ethnic Hutu, in a plane crash April 6, 1994.
France, an ally of the Hutu nationalist government before the 1994 killings, has repeatedly denied any complicity in the genocide.
