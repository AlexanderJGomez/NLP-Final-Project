Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- The Yemeni government has lost control over five provinces, and security in the country is deteriorating, the nation's acting president told CNN in an exclusive interview Wednesday.
But, he added, the president's health was improving daily.
Nevertheless, he gave a robust defense of Saleh, challenging the widely held view that the embattled leader is now part of the problem, rather than part of the solution.
Saleh still has 3 million supporters, Hadi said.
Drones carrying missiles, actually these missiles could not be fired ... unless the voice of the enemy himself is recorded," he said.
Since arriving there, he said, the president had been improving and fully intends to return.
But when asked when that would be, he said he did not know.
But, he added, the military cannot provide the whole answer.
