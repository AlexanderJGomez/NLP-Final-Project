Salinger has emerged, at least in the pages of court documents, to try to stop a novel that presents Holden Caulfield, the disaffected teen hero of his classic "The Catcher in the Rye," as an old man.
"The Sequel infringes Salinger's copyright rights in both his novel and the character Holden Caulfield, who is the narrator and essence of that novel," said the suit, filed Monday in U.S. District Court in New York.
"There's no more to Holden Caulfield.
It describes a character, "Mr. C," who flees his nursing home and "embarks on a curious journey through the streets of New York."
"It's amazing," he said of the book.
"If it was something else, or it felt like a knock-off or whatever, I would have told the publisher we wouldn't do it.
Mitchell's estate argued that the book, by novelist Alice Randall, infringed upon her copyright.
"The sequel is not a parody and it does not comment upon or criticize the original," the lawsuit argues.
