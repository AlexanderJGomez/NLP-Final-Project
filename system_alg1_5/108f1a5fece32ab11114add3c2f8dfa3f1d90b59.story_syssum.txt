They all seem to think we need to get a smarter guy in the White House fast, and Bush is so stupid, that task shouldn't be too hard.
Not me.
The idea, especially from the Democrats that I know, is, we just get a smarter guy in the White House, and all the problems will go away.
He's more ambitious than I; he's going to be the next president of the United States, and I couldn't even get to week three of "Dancing with the Stars."
They both promise a government that will watch over us, and I don't like that.
Freedom means the freedom to be stupid, and that's what I want.
You gotta be smarter than me to do all that, but you don't have to be as smart as Obama, and you sure don't have to be a great leader.
People won't even hear someone suggesting that our president should do less and individual citizens should do more for themselves.
If we could find a lazier, less charismatic, stupider person than me to be president, I'd be all for it.
