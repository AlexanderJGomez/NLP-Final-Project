Leading 4-0 from the semifinal first leg in the Allianz Arena, Bayern ruthlessly pulled apart a Barcelona side missing their talisman Lionel Messi, who sat out the second leg on the bench.
Robben came close to breaking the deadlock in the first half, but delayed his shot.
When given a second chance just after the break the Dutch international, a former Real Madrid player, cut inside to beat Valdes with a curling shot.
Robben, by contrast, is already looking forward to the final against their arch German rivals.
