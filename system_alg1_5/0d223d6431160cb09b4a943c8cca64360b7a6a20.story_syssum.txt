For example, Fox News seems incapable of commenting on this story without the header "NSA Scandal," a lead that brings with it its own conclusion.
I mean we have a CIA.
As far back as at least 2000, the NSA tried to hit the real question head-on.
And that basically is the issue of the moment, whether the headline is PRISM, XKeyscore, metadata, "upstream" communications, Blarney or an alleged NSA secret room at an AT&T facility in San Francisco -- all of which have been featured in recent coverage.
Although Congress, the courts and two administrations have authorized what the NSA is doing today, these are not easy issues.
This is important.
Most intelligence collection -- by the NSA, CIA or any intelligence agency -- is not overseen by a court.
Actually, that's not quite correct -- and never has been.
This is what the NSA calls incidental collection of information to, from or about a U.S. person.
That may be, but the NSA is not targeting them without a warrant.
In this, as in most issues, facts (and context) matter.
Understanding beyond the accusatory headline or the facile quip is needed, or we will be just tossing slogans at one another, slinging volleys of hyperbole, stoking fears and anger and distrust, all of which will make it even more difficult to resolve an already very difficult question.
