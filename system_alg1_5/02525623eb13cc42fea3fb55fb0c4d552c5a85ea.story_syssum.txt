"To Jackie and her parents, I say I am sorry," Rector George Keith Martin said at an emergency meeting of UVA's governing board this week.
"To the survivors of sexual assault and their families, I am also sorry."
In the interview, Eramo admitted that no student had been expelled for committing sexual assault, even when there was an admission, and even though offenses such as academic cheating regularly lead to expulsion.
"I do feel like that person admitting in that context it shows a recognition of what they have done is wrong, and a willingness to improve," Eramo said, when pressed on the subject.
Although Eramo's interview struck many as tone deaf, particularly given the Rolling Stone story, Jackie released an open letter in support of the associated dean to the student newspaper, The Cavalier Daily.
If it were not for her, I do not know if I could be alive today," Jackie wrote.
"Not our reputation, not our success, and not our history or tradition."
