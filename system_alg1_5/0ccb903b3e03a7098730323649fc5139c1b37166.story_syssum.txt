Rodriguez, who had to leave the game, was awarded first base after being hit, but there were no other penalties to Hernandez, who, on a night when his control was off, hit two other Yankees (three of the last five batters he faced) before giving way to a relief pitcher in a game that ended with a 4-2 Seattle victory.
Yet what the helmet-to-helmet hit is to football, the bean ball and its cousin, the brushback pitch, are to baseball -- a tactic that is potentially life-threatening.
In 2000, New York Mets catcher Mike Piazza was forced to miss the All-Star game as a result of the concussion and headaches that followed a beaning by the New York Yankees Roger Clemens, a notorious brushback pitcher, whom Piazza had tagged for a grand-slam home run a month earlier.
But mandatory helmets should be a last, not a first, resort when it comes to player safety.
Instead, of being awarded first base, a batter struck above the chest should be given second base and thus put in a position to score on a single.
Rule 3: Make a team, not just an individual pitcher, accountable for hit batters.
A team could not, as a result, game the penalty system for hitting batters.
A few batters might take advantage of them and try to get hit, but given the dangers that come from a pitch traveling upward of 90 mph, most batters are not likely to risk their careers just to get on base.
These reforms don't turn baseball into a game for softies or cheats.
