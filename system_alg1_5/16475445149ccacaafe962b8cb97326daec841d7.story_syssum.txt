(CNN) -- He's known as "The Little Master" and now Sachin Tendulkar can lay claim to being the only man in cricket history to reach 100 international centuries.
"I was not thinking about the milestone.
I was not playing for my 100th hundred.
It took only a little gloss off the earlier milestone for 39-year-old Tendulkar, who is India's most high-profile sporting icon in a country where cricket is a religion.
A hundred 100's.
India's prime minister, Manmohan Singh, paid tribute to Tendulkar in a statement.
"Tendulkar's long career has been a triumph of class, character and courage.
The closest player to Tendulkar in terms of hundreds is former Australia captain Ricky Ponting, who has 71 centuries.
