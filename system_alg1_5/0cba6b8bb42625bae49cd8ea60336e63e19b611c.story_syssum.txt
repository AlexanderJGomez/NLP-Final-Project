But for a little more than $100 a month, Hong Kong resident Ken Chan can develop his start-up, network with like-minded people and relax with a game of ping-pong -- all under the same roof.
"Coming here, you can feel supported by other people working on their businesses and feel less alone," said Chan, who goes to the co-working space CoCoon, where he works on his Internet start-up, wholedaybuy.com.
"It's only becoming acceptable to take the risk of starting tech start-ups or being a freelancer," says Constant Tedder, the British founder of The Hive in Hong Kong, a co-working space that opened in May.
For freelancers, who often work in creative industries like design, stuffy cubicles just do not cut it, Tedder said.
At CoCoon, which occupies a sprawling 14,000 square feet and has a ping-pong table and meditation room, members must pass an application process, showing that they have something to offer the co-working community, whether it be a solid start-up idea, programming skills, mentorship or investment potential.
So for Jah Ying Chung, who is starting launchpilots.org, a site that helps young people get involved in social causes, going to CoCoon provides motivation.
