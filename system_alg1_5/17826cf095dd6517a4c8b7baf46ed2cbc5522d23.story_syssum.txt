Newspaper vendor John Mgbachi, a former shoemaker from Eastern Nigeria, who has a stand in Tinubu Square on Lagos Island said that far from being bad for business, he welcomes the free readers.
"It's not really a static price, it depends on the bargaining power of the person," he added.
The free readers come from all walks of life and CNN spoke to analysts, an accountant and unemployed youth at the stand we visited.
He added that the dire economic situation in the country meant that many Nigerians cannot afford to buy newspapers.
