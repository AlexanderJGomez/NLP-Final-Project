The choice isn't an easy one, as his speakership quite likely hangs in the balance.
House Republicans expected Boehner to uphold the rule and he pledged to do so.
Earmarks have been banned, most incumbents do their own fundraising, and for many of the chamber's newer members, ideology trumps party loyalty.
In 1995-96, when the federal government last shut down, 34% of House Republicans represented districts that Bill Clinton won in 1992.
He could, as he has done previously, pass a funding bill on the backs of House Democrats.
Convincing House Republicans to pass the Senate's funding bill and re-open the federal government will require him to lead in a way that may not be possible, should he wish to remain speaker.
But these are Boehner's choices.
It may, however, prove more productive than following the lead of his majority.
