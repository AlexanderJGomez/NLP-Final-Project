Nor, given Romney's embrace of Donald Trump, should we be surprised by this joke-that's-not-a-joke.
But what, exactly, did Romney reveal with this pre-meditated "offhand" remark?
Romney -- hiding behind the plausible deniability that it was just a joke, with a wink and a nod to the extremists in his base -- tried to divert attention from the ABC's haunting his campaign: Akin, Bain, "Corporations are people."
But it is sad and revealing, nevertheless.
Romney is campaigning as if he feels he is entitled to the White House -- that, like a feudal lord or European aristocrat, he does not have to answer questions, he does not have to be forthright, he does not have to be honest.
How we respond to Romney's remark will reveal a lot about us, as well.
As I said, we shouldn't be surprised by Romney's remark.
-- I'll lie about Obama's plans, but won't explain my own.
Mr. Romney, America's not an aristocracy.
It's who you help, what you're willing to sacrifice, and how honest you are.
