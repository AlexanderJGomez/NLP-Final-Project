The very next day, the Nigerian military announced that all but nine of the girls had been rescued.
But like the news of the release of the schoolgirls, it proved to be fiction.
For a country that is not at war, death is cheap and plentiful.
Not since the civil war, almost 50 years ago, has it been tested this much.
The closest it got were the lengthy tours of duty in Liberia and Sierra Leone, in which it played a prominent role at the head of the West African ECOMOG Force, intended more as a "peacekeeping" unit than a combat force.
That's heartwarming.
Finally the military will need to prepare to adapt itself to the reality of the government's planned shift to a "soft" counter-terrorism strategy, embodied in a document unveiled by National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki, a retired Army Colonel, in March.
