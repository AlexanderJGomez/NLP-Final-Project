(CNN) -- The president of Guinea-Bissau was assassinated Monday morning, a day after an explosion killed the head of the West African country's military, the prime minister said.
The army, he said, will remain neutral.
Five other high-ranking military officials were wounded, two of them critically.
Guinea-Bissau, a former Portuguese colony, has a history of military coups.
In 1980, Vieira became president after a military coup.
He held the post for five years, until a military mutiny ousted him, and the country plunged into civil war.
