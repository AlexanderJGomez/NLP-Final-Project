About two minutes after liftoff, the first-stage, reusable rocket booster fell into the Atlantic, where it was to be picked up by a ship.
It was the first flight test for the Constellation Program, NASA's next-generation spacecraft and launch vehicle system.
"It's a very dynamic situation," Winters said.
NASA's primary concern was the high-level, cold clouds that can cause triboelectrification, or the production of a kind of static electricity, similar to what happens when you walk across a carpet, then touch something.
The parachutes are a primary element of the rocket's deceleration system, NASA says.
The top of the rocket, known as the upper stage, includes a mock Orion crew capsule and a launch abort system.
