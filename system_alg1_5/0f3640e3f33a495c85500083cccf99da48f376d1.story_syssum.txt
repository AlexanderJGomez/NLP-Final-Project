But with expectations beyond high for Google to swoop in and save the day from Apple's unreliable, problematic maps app -- which replaced the existing Google Maps app in September with the rollout of the new iOS 6 software -- many just hoped Google's version would live up to promises of being a superior mapping platform for the iPhone.
The good news, however, is that the Google Maps app is excellent.
However, some users have expressed frustration with direction accuracy so far, but the reports are nowhere near the inaccuracy outcry caused after the launch of the Apple Maps app.
Now, people love to talk about how much they hate the Apple Maps app.
But say what you want about Apple Maps and its accuracy issues, it's hard to deny its interface is gorgeous and touts some impressive features.
Although Google Maps incorporates 2D and 3D views via Street View, as well as the rotating and tilting of maps with gestures inside the app, we still prefer Apple's design.
As a bonus for developers -- and app users alike -- Google announced Google Maps SDK for iOS, which gives app developers the opportunity to use maps within apps for the iPod Touch, iPhone and iPad.
Public transit, street view and easy searching propel Google to a clear victory -- for now.
