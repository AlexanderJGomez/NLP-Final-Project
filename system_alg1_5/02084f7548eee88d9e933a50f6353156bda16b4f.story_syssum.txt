Rob Sellard and his wife, Sylvia, farm 14,000 acres, or about 22 square miles, in Kansas.
This wheat crop here, when we fertilized last August or September, fertilizer was $1,100," Sellard says.
But cattle production, like the economy, is also suffering.
"With the fears on Wall Street, people have stopped eating out so much," he says.
As of this week, wheat was selling for $5.39 a bushel at a local grain elevator in Bucklin, in southwestern Kansas.
"You can read all you want, the sensationalism of high prices a year ago," he says.
"I think that farmers for the most part up our way, there is no question that net income has increased the last two years significantly to what it was, due to the commodity prices going up to what they did," he says.
Estes, however, says he does worry about the impact of the economic downturn on rural America as the effects of the recession start to hit home.
"There is less consumption going on, so [the grain is] not going to be moving out of here," he says.
"We are concerned," Sellard says.
