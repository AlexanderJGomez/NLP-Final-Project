Opinions expressed in the rapid-fire Twitter echo chamber, particularly in response to political news, are often at odds with the general public's.
At other times, it's more conservative.
On Twitter, a full 77% of tweets about his win were positive and only 23% negative.
In a 2012 survey, half of adults who said they posted news on Twitter were younger than 30, compared with 23% of all adults.
On Twitter, a measly 6% expressed support, while 32% were negative and a clear majority, 62%, expressed no opinion.
Politics also reflect a truth that anyone who's followed the Oscars, Super Bowl, debate nights or, really, any public event can attest to -- the Twitter universe is never happier than when it's being snarky, or downright nasty, to someone.

In the Pew's 2012 news consumption survey, just 13% of adults said they ever use Twitter or read Twitter messages.
