"Stereotypes in the media reduce Indian country to the Plains Indian in a headdress," said scholar Adrienne Keene, a member of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma whom Wilbur photographed for the series.
"Having these counter-narratives and counter-representations to the stereotypes and negative portrayals we see in the media every day is really important for helping people understand contemporary Native Americans," said Keene.
The project is also building relationships in Indian country, cultivating bonds among Wilbur, the participants and also connecting them to elite institutions like the Tacoma Art Museum, Keene said.
"The project is for the people, not just native people but everyone," Wilbur said.
Letting them decide is central to the project, Wilbur said.
Keene, a Harvard-educated post-doctoral researcher at Brown University focusing on Native access to higher education, deconstructs stereotypes of Native Americans on her blog, Native Appropriations.
"We talked about how to me, being a real Cherokee means I can go to those places and feel a connection with the land and know my ancestors stood there thousands of years ago," she said.
I hadn't felt it until I was there."
"The life we live is for the people," Wilbur said.
"That's what I was raised for, to find my gift and share it with the community."
