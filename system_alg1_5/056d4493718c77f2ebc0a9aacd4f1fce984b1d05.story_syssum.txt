Government should be seen as a force for good, not evil.
Instead, the President is living his own version of "Alice Through the Looking Glass": staring down a rabbit hole of government bureaucracy and inefficiency.
About a year ago, after the NSA program was revealed and Democrats and libertarians started squawking, Obama seemed more than a tad defensive on government spying.
Indeed.
It's a management issue.
Use it, and manage it.
In a campaign, for instance, they all want to elect the same person: him.
But when you have to negotiate—or lead—people not related to you, or not indebted to you or who don't agree with you, it's a different story.
Just ask Obama, who was government's best friend.
