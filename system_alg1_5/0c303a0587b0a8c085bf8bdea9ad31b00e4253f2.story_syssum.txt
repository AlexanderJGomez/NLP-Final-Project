"This house is not livable right now," Nelson Ortega, the city's chief building code inspector, told CNN as he stood in front of a boarded-up single-family home on a residential street in Nashua.
"About a third of all of the foreclosed properties nationwide have been so damaged, either by the previous owners or by criminal gangs coming in after the foreclosure, that they no longer qualify for standard mortgage financing," Thomas Popik told CNN.
"In many cases, it costs so much to rehabilitate these houses, it's just not cost-effective," he told CNN.
"A lot of these homes have been vandalized," Dana Ash, an Atlanta, Georgia, real estate broker, told CNN.
The banks that own the properties, Ash told CNN, probably will not simply walk away from the homes.
"There are some cases where the properties have been so damaged that it's not profitable for the mortgage investor, which is a bank, to take title to the property," he said.
But, the spokesman added, the worse the economy is in a particular region, the more damaged and vandalized foreclosed homes are likely to be.
