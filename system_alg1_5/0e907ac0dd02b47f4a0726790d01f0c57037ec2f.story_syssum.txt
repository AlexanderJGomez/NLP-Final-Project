In another of the group's songs entitled "Nefsy Afagar" ("I Want To Explode") Eid sings: "A new order, just like the old one.
"We have many fans that will get very angry if we didn't release these songs," says Eid, who claims the band speaks the mind of many Egyptians.
"We talk about freedom, social rights, what we think will make a better place for all of us," says guitarist Sherif El-Hawary.
"The revolution is not politics.
This is what we sing about.
(We) work very slowly, but we never go back... Look at the past three years, regimes changed and we continued the revolution," says Eid.
