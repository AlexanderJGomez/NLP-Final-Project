Chaifetz posted the recording online Monday, which has since led to disciplinary actions, including the removal of at least one teacher, school officials said.
"The school district was as horrified as I was," he said.
He wasn't getting answers as to why Akian had been acting out, so he decided to bug the boy, he said.
It was unlike his son to misbehave and hit his teachers, Chaifetz said, though he had difficulty getting answers from Akian because he struggles with speaking.
