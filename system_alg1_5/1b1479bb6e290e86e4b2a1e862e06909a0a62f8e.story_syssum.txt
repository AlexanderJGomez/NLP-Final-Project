The damaged bus is hauled from the crash scene on a flatbed truck Friday in Sherman, Texas.
Twelve people were declared dead at the scene, and four others died at hospitals, officials said.
The trip to Carthage, Missouri, had been scheduled by the Vietnamese Catholic Martyrs Church in Houston, though some of the passengers may have belonged to other churches, Hersman said.
Late Friday, police were assisting NTSB investigators with gathering evidence and mapping the scene, documenting the location of witness marks and scars on the highway and bridge rail over an overpass, she said.
"This review resulted in FMCSA placing Angel Tours' operations out of service," Hill said.
Massage therapist Leha Nguyen, 45, was a passenger.
About 11:45 p.m., the bus passed Dallas, "and as soon as we passed Dallas we were on the two-way freeway and I feel the bus ride a little bit fast and I have a feeling, not a safe feeling," she said.
She accepted an ambulance ride to the hospital, where she learned that her seatmate had died.
