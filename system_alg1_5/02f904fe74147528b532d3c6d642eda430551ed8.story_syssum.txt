While some authors choose to write under a pen name as a form of artistic expression, many female authors purposefully opt for a male pseudonym to appeal to a wider audience, says Carmela Ciuraru, author of "Nom de plume: A (secret) history of pseudonyms".
Best known for her seminal tale "Little Women", Louisa May Alcott, spent much of her early career writing under the nom de plume A. M. Barnard.
Publishing an essay in 1856 entitled "Silly Novels by Lady Novelists," Evans lambasted the glut of unremarkable work produced by women in the era, which she believed diminished the credibility of female writers as a whole.
Publishing works under male names beginning with the same first letter as their own, Currer, Acton and Ellis Bell produced their first offering -- a collection of poems -- in 1846, before going on to publish individual novels shortly after.
"Charlotte really believed in their talents, and was actually very controlling about the publication of their work," says Ciuraru.
