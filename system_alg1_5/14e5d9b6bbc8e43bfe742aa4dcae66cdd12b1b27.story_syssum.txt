The Games have provided countless moments of inspiration, not only about personal achievement but, more importantly, about breaking down the barriers that push apart countries and individuals.
Now, that tragedy has become the source of more disheartening behavior, this time by officials of the International Olympic Committee, who adamantly refuse to mark the anniversary of that dark day with a simple moment of silence.
Incredibly, the IOC has steadfastly refused that very simple request.
Politics have always been part of the games, and very deliberately.
That is misguided and shameful.
The energy for the campaign originated with Ankie Spitzer, whose husband, Andrei, was the fencing coach of the Israeli Olympic delegation in 1972.
Spitzer, who said, "Hatred and revenge are not a part of me," insisted she fervently believes in the Olympic ideal.
Her request, like all the others, was denied.
Silence contains no statements, assumptions or beliefs and requires no understanding of language to interpret."
That's not enough.
The IOC still refuses.
With the growing pressure, the chairman of the London 2012 Organizing Committee, Sebastian Coe, has reportedly said he will hold a personal memorial for the Israeli athletes.
