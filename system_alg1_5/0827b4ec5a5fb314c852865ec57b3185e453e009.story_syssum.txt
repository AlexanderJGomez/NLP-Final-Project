But the talks this week were, nevertheless, historic, particularly for the otherwise frozen U.S.-Iranian relationship.
Over the course of the eight-day round of talks, negotiators, their delegations, their security details and reporters were confined primarily to the immediate area around the five-star Beau-Rivage Palace Hotel, which played host to the negotiations.
The setting is idyllic, and the grounds are beautifully maintained.
"It was tough, very intense at times, sometimes emotional and confrontational."
Over the past 18 months since talks began, Zarif said, negotiators have "developed personal respect" for one another, even though serious mistrust still exists between Iran and the Western powers.
"I think they're quite skilled, actually, at using the media to deliver messages and to try to shape the frame of the negotiation," the official said.
Meanwhile, the traveling press corps covering the foreign ministers were given coveted red badges, allowing them access to the hotel, where the talks took place.
"We'd get close, we kept on changing the plane schedule," a senior administration official told reporters.
There were "many moments (throughout the negotiations) when we thought we'd call it a day, call it a night, decide we'd gone as far as we could go," said the official, who briefed reporters on Kerry's plane.
"It was a very, very intense," said the official.
And with that, the room devolved into chaos as journalists ran for the doors.
By midday Friday, the delegations had left Lausanne, along with most of the media, returning the scenic Swiss city to its more tranquil pace.
