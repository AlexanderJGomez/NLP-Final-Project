Alesia Crockett, who suffers from bipolar disorder, ended up in a hospital hours outside New Orleans.
"Most of the time, I was in a fog, but I do remember some things," Crockett said.
A report about mental health issues in New Orleans after Katrina, published in early 2008 in the journal Psychiatric Annals, lists the number of inpatient psychiatric beds in greater New Orleans at 487 before the storm.
"The situation is unconscionable, atrocious.
"I can remember being in the back of an ambulance, and I kept thinking, 'This is taking so long,' " Crockett said.
"The system has been in horrible shape for a while," she said.
A struggle ensued, and Johnson overpowered and killed Cotton with her own gun, police said.
"People are outraged," Abramson said.
After Cotton's death in 2008, legislators allotted $14.2 million to NOAH, Abramson says.
"That's why this is so critical," Abramson said.
Jan Johnson, the New Orleans psychiatrist, agrees about the need for more community-based services.
Today, Crockett, Johnson's patient, is well.
If I want the help that I so desperately need, I can't get it because it's not there."
