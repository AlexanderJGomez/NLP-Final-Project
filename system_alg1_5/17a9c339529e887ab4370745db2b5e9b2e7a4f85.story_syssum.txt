ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- As half of the famed hip-hop duo OutKast, Antwan "Big Boi" Patton is known for his bass-booming, chart-topping smash hits.
On paper, Big Boi and Stallings couldn't be more different.
"It's definitely one of the funkiest hybrids I've ever seen," Big Boi said.
"For me [Big Boi's music] sounds like Shostakovich, Stravinsky a little ... just today's Stravinsky," Stallings said.
But the greatest collaborating may be the pairing created by Stallings and Big Boi when Giuseppe Verdi's "La Traviata" is intertwined with "Morris Brown," a cut from OutKast's "Idlewild" soundtrack.
"Its very moving, sophisticated, elegant but at the same time it will tear your back off," Big Boi said.
"Although it may seem off the traditional path, it's certainly in the realm of ballet collaborations," she said.
"You [hope] to open up people's minds to different avenues that they might not think they can or cannot take," Big Boi said.
If "big" is successful, the show could tour, Big Boi said.
"If you come in there with your tie on, you might have your bow tie leaning to one side when you leave," Big Boi said, "because you're definitely going to move."
