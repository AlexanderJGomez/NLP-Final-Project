In a written response sent to CNN by Snapchat, Spiegel, now 23, apologized for the e-mails.
A Snapchat spokeswoman told CNN that Spiegel had no further comment.
He left the university in 2012, shortly before finishing his degree, to focus on Snapchat.
Spiegel has denied the lawsuit's allegations.
Snapchat reportedly turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook last fall.
