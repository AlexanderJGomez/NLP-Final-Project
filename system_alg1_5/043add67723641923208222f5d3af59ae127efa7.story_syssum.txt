To the world, he was known as "Chespirito."
According to his official biography, Gomez Bolanos got his nickname from a film director who, after reading something he'd written, dubbed him "a little Shakespeare."
Vivar, who played several Chespirito's characters, said that part of Gomez Bolanos' genius was "that he wrote (TV shows) based on the individual actor's or actress' acting ability," which allowed for better and funnier comedy situations.
By 1968, Gomez Bolanos was already writing for his own show, and by 1971, he had developed two of his most famous TV characters.
"While the parents of my friends went to work building houses or to hospitals or attorneys' offices, my dad would dress in all red, wore antennae and went to work," Gomez Fernandez said.
His first message on Twitter on May 28, 2011, was "siganme los buenos," or "follow me, those of you who are good," a phrase that he constantly used on his shows and that many people still use in Mexico and elsewhere.
