For the past few months, the Egyptian media and state institutions have been ardently working to pave the way for el-Sisi's presidency by distorting and smearing his political opponents.
Thus it is not surprising that both, el-Sisi and his Gulf allies, share the same authoritarian mindset and behavior.
Surprisingly, or maybe not, the international community remains in limbo watching the manufacturing of a new dictatorship in Egypt while doing nothing to prevent the possibility of such a scenario.
Simply, the level of violence and amount of killings and casualties is unprecedented in Egypt's modern history.
El-Sisi, Egypt's most likely post-coup president, will not be able to bring stability or security to the country.
Egypt is dangerously close to a social explosion due to unemployment, poverty and corruption.
Surely, el-Sisi's Gulf backers will likely continue their "lifeline" of support, at least for a while.
Therefore, it is important that the international community, particularly the U.S. and EU, do not lend credibility to the bogus elections that will bring him to power.
