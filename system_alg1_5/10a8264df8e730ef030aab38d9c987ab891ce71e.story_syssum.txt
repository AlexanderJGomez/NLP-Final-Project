"There's a big value that going through a traditional publisher brings to someone like me," Ohanian said in a phone interview from Malmo, Sweden, where he was speaking at a conference.
The tiny, charitable publisher that Ohanian runs, called Breadpig, puts out books for popular Web comics, such as XKCD and Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal.
"Without Your Permission" is expected to be published in early 2013, according to Rick Wolff, the publisher and editor-in-chief for Business Plus.
"This guy is a real personality, and he obviously knows the Internet," Wolff said.
However, Ohanian has Wolff and his team convinced.
