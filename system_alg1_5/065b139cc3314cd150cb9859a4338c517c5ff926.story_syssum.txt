There was little publicity for Seattle's first medical marijuana farmers market held on Sunday.
"Medical marijuana is not legal in the state of Washington," said state Department of Health spokesman Donn Moyer.
"Dispensaries are not legal, co-ops are not legal here," Moyer said.
"It's a city by city, county by county situation right now," said Philip Dawdy, a spokesman for the Sunday market and medical marijuana advocate who says there is still "an old West" feel to the medical marijuana community in the state.
"This could be construed as dealing drugs," medical marijuana grower Ken Bell said as a line of customers grew in front of his "Ken's Medicine Bowl" stand.
"We don't want to be anything like California," market spokesman Dawdy said.
