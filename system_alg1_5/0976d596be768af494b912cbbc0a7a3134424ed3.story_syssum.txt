A U.S. general who oversaw nuclear weapons was relieved of his duties after he boozed, fraternized with "hot women" and disrespected his hosts during an official visit to Russia, Air Force officials said.
In addition, Carey announced he'd "met two hot women the night before," and continually interrupted a monastery guide during a tour, his speech slurred the entire time, the report said.
There was no indication Carey's behavior compromised sensitive nuclear information or went beyond drinking, dancing and fraternizing with the women, officials said.
The same missile unit at Malmstrom linked to the test cheating scandal failed a safety and security inspection "after making tactical-level errors -- not related to command and control of nuclear weapons," the Air Force Global Strike Command said.
"These inspections are designed to be tough to pass," he said.
The officers, based in Minot, North Dakota, did poorly in an inspection.
"We are, in fact, in a crisis right now," he wrote.
