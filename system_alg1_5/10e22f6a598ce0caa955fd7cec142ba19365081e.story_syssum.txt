The Ebola outbreak "is moving faster than our efforts to control it," Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organization, said in a statement Friday.
One of those countries could be the United States, health officials have said.
First of all, there's no vaccine for Ebola.
For example, American Patrick Sawyer became infected with Ebola in Liberia and traveled via plane to Lagos, Nigeria, where he died.
The outbreak is "taking place in areas with fluid population movements over porous borders, and it has demonstrated its ability to spread via air travel, contrary to what has been seen in past outbreaks," Chan said.
The evacuation of these staff members has begun, Samaritan's Purse said.
"Our role at CDC is to make sure in the transportation and in the care, any risk of infection to others is kept to the absolute minimum," Frieden said.
"This is not sound science, and this will not be tolerated."
Soon.
The patients will be brought to Emory University, which is near CDC's headquarters, hospital officials told Gupta.
"Emory University Hospital physicians, nurses and staff are highly trained in the specific and unique protocols and procedures necessary to treat and care for this type of patient," the statement said.
One, Ebola is aggressively infectious, which means that those infected are highly likely to get sick.
Yes.
Some international staff are infected," Chan said.
