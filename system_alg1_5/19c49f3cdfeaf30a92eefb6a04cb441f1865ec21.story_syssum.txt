Now, Gallup has released a survey showing that for the first time since 2005, more people approve than disapprove of Bush.
With the exception of a few of our leaders, such as Abraham Lincoln of Franklin Roosevelt, people tend to remember presidents in different ways at different times.
Another factor has to do with what the successor does in office.
In some ways, Obama did Bush a favor.
Presidential reputations also can be shaped, in the relative short term, by what a president does after leaving office.
When a president is in office, they tend to receive all the blame, or credit, for what happens in Washington.
When there are problems moving forward a policy, such as in reviving the economy, the public tends to blame the president.
President Dwight Eisenhower, who was once treated as a popular yet bumbling president, was found to have had a firm grip on decision-making in the White House.
After all, it's all relative with respect to time.
