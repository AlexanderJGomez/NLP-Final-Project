There she might get not only answers but the "morning-after," or Plan B, pill -- and not necessarily with her parent's direct consent.
The program, which also allows for the distribution of condoms and birth control pills, began in January 2011.
"What you're doing is you're giving a young child, between the age of 14 and 17, a chemical drug and hormonal cocktail without the knowledge of the parent, not knowing the medical history or if that child has any kind of drug allergies," Davids told HLN's "Evening Express," noting teens can't get an aspirin in school "without informed consent" but could get the morning-after pill.
Yet Davids, who has a teenage girl and a young boy, said, "Most parents I've spoken to" in schools involved in the program never got a letter from the city's health or education departments, thus never opted out of the program.
"Once you have a kid, that's the end of it, let's be honest."
Another woman, Holly Macke, said the program was "not good, but it's OK" -- especially if the alternative is a teenager having an illegal and possibly dangerous abortion after getting pregnant.
"We've been doing this for a long time," he said.
