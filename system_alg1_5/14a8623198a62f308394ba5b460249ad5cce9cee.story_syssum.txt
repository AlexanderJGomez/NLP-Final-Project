Now, as economic growth goes into reverse, Ukraine is in desperate need of financial help.
Sadly, lawmakers balked, and the legislation failed by eight votes as too many members of parliament abstained.
After all, Ukraine ranked 144th out of 177 countries in the 2013 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions index, with a score that indicated rampant corruption.
In addition, the proposals include a time-bound, three-year National Anti-corruption Strategic Plan that sets goals for implementing laws, as well as a law that would make it possible to try those suspected of corruption even if they are not in Ukraine.
It's perhaps no wonder, then, that a parliament filled with politicians who profited from Yanukovych's term in office would not be happy with these new laws, and although Poroshenko thought he had amassed the votes to get them passed in September, enough abstained to scupper his plans.
The question is whether lawmakers will seize this opportunity to pass a strong set of anti-corruption laws that will show parliament is committed to ruling the country for the people, not for themselves.
