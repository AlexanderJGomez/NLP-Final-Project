"I just knew FootGolf would be a bit of a no-brainer for the amount of golf courses there are, as well as the number of golfers and footballers," O'Connor told CNN of a game that involves players kicking a football around a golf course, complete with bigger holes.
"He created everything, from how the game is played, down to the look of the players.
Jansen, now an FIFG ambassador, held the first FootGolf competition in the Netherlands in 2008, after hearing of a unique idea from friend and former professional footballer Willem Korsten.
That's why footballers turn to golf," he told CNN.
Some footballers play golf but do it as a hobby, to relax and wind down, and escape from the pressures of a football match on a Saturday."
It's definitely the fun element that attracts people to it," O'Connor said.
"When I first set up FootGolf I knew a lot of people would want to play the sport, and I knew I wouldn't be alone in liking the idea of playing football on a golf course," he said.
And if you get the youngsters involved you're going to still be going in 10, 20, 30 years' time, and you'll be continuing to build, develop and progress."
Hughes will take on the role of academy director, and like O'Connor, he feels the scheme can help to push the boundaries of FootGolf even further.
As well as furthering the profile of the sport, the Academy Scheme will be hoping to produce some of the FootGolfers of tomorrow.
"There's quite a small, but cult, following of people that do this.
"In five years' time, every country in the world that has got golf courses will be a member of the Federation for International FootGolf," O'Connor said.
That's how big an impact the sport is having around the world."
