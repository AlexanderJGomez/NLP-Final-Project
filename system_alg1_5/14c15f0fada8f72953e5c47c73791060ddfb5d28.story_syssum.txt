Noe Nino de Rivera was transported to the hospital on November 20 after Bastrop County Sheriff's Deputy Randy McMillan, serving as a school resource officer, used the device on him after the teen tried to defuse a school fight involving two girls, one of them his girlfriend, said attorney Adam Loewy.
While NDR was unconscious, defendant McMillan placed him in handcuffs," the family's lawsuit says.
When they did, Nino de Rivera was taken to a local hospital and later airlifted to St. David's Medical Center in nearby Austin, where he "underwent surgery to repair a severe brain hemorrhage and was placed in a medically induced coma," court documents say.
"He was saying 'I shouldn't have done that,' " Lawrence said.
(Nino de Rivera) was not acting aggressively," the attorney said.
"There are other methods of de-escalating fights that wouldn't pose the same risk," she said.
