Fort Meade, Maryland (CNN) -- After four days of testimony and 20 prosecution witnesses, Pfc.
Padgett said when they began talking, Manning was calm, but that he began to change.
At that point another soldier came in the room, subdued Manning, sat him down and Padgett continued counseling him, Padgett testified.
Manning is accused of stealing and leaking nearly three-quarters of a million classified documents from the State Department and the Defense Department to the WikiLeaks website, which published many of them.
Barclay Keay, testified by phone about his time with Manning's unit.
Even though he called only two, Coombs had requested 48 witnesses, ten of whom were already on the prosecution witness list.
Mark Zaid, a national security attorney, said the fact the defense called only two witnesses is not surprising.
After that the Investigating Officer, Lt. Col. Paul Almanza, who oversaw the hearing, will consider the testimony and evidence and make a recommendation as to whether Manning should face court martial and if so, on which charges.
If convicted on all counts, he could face the death penalty.
Lamo testified that based on an e-mail he received from Manning, as well as an examination of Manning's Facebook page, that Bradass87 was Manning.
