Sowell, 50, faces rape and kidnapping charges as well and also has been charged with brutalizing three other women and raping two of them, Mason said.
"We're just trying to cover all our bases," said Scott Wilson, spokesman for the FBI, which is assisting local detectives in the case.
The women in September and October were raped, and the other woman was punched and choked before escaping, Mason said.
Sowell threatened his victims and warned them not to contact police, Mason said.
Sowell "knew what he was doing was wrong at the time he was doing it," the prosecutor said.
Most of the victims were strangled by ligature -- which could include a string, cord or wire -- and at least one was strangled by hand, officials said.
No more remains were found.
