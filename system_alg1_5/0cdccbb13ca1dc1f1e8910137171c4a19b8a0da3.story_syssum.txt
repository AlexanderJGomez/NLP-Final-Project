Diego Leon Montoya Sanchez was captured in his underwear, hiding in bushes, Gen. Mario Montoya Uribe said.
Plans revved up three days ago, when informants told authorities that Montoya was in the town of Salsa in the department of El Valle, he said.
"With this information, we mounted the operation," he said.
Inside they found three women, including Montoya Sanchez's mother, and two men, one of them his uncle.
It was not immediately clear who, if anyone, would get it.
