These intensive examinations, repeated at yearly intervals, allowed experts to sketch a few conclusions about the psychology of group survival when hope, like light, is gone.
At 8:06 p.m. October 23, 1958, in Springhill, Nova Scotia, one of the deepest coal mines on Earth collapsed, with 174 men underground.
Hundreds of people -- families, reporters, cameramen, officials and onlookers -- mobbed the mouth of the mine.
In one cave a mile below the surface, seven men awoke from the crash in rock prisons; at a deeper elevation, 12 men found themselves walled in together.
In each group, a natural leader emerged.
On the third day, even the crumbs were gone, canteens were dry, and head lamps blinked off.
In the darkness, with no projects and work to distract them, the men could no longer avoid sad thoughts.
Then he realized that the mine disaster probably caused the schools to close, and he felt lonely again, not knowing where his daughter was.
Now, in both groups, new leaders arose.
Another remarkable thing happened underground, and it was that conventional social barriers fell.
In one of the groups, the second leader, the sharer of hope, was Afro-Canadian.
He was more than equal.
Georgia was segregated; only one motel, solely for whites, existed on Jekyll Island.
Thus was the fellowship that existed underground -- between black and white, educated and uneducated, those of legitimate birth and those born "out of wedlock" -- gradually dissolved by the bright light of day.
