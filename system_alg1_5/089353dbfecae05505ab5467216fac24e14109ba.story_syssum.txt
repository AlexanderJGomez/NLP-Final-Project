If we could see off camera, we might see Bieber's attorney subtly shaking his head in frustration.
But a deposition is no interview, and treating it that way is to invite catastrophe.
There are lawyers, a stenographer, questions and answers.
Generally, the more your opponent gets you to talk at a deposition, the more information he or she has to use against you at trial.
Watch, for example, when he answers: "Guess what?
A witness should only answer the question asked, lest he volunteer information to help the other side.
Depositions are not soapboxes:  At a deposition, you will never "show up" the other side's lawyers.
Bieber."
At a deposition, the lawyer asks the questions, not the witness.
That's why grizzled veterans of "deps" routinely acknowledge that, practically, they can feel like a fishing expedition.
We all know it's nearly impossible to tell the same story twice, but a good cross-examiner will make minor inconsistencies from an earlier deposition look like a flawed memory, or worse, paint the witness as a liar.
A: Oh yeah, sure.
For the most part, lawyers cannot.
It wasn't all terrible: In fairness to Bieber, he did some things right.
If he could carve out his other behavior, in some respects, he's not half-bad as a deponent.
