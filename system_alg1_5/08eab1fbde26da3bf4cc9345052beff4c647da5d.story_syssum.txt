Manama, Bahrain (CNN) -- Security forces in Bahrain stormed the main hospital, beating doctors, and attacked demonstrators in Manama's Pearl Roundabout on Wednesday, witnesses in the Bahraini capital said.
Three arrests were made, an interior ministry spokesman said.
Security forces blocked highways leading to the capital and formed a ring around the country's main hospital, Salmaniya Medical Complex, not letting people enter or leave, witnesses said.
"We are trapped," Sharaf said.
"We are in a small group hiding," Haji said, her voice rising with emotion.
Eventually, the army told hospital workers that they could leave, but they had to give their names and have their pictures taken, Haji said.
We could see tear gas being dispersed," Jamjoom said.
Officials at another private hospital, Salmany Hospital, also said they were being besieged by troops.
The Bahraini government denied the allegations and said foreign troops had been dispatched to secure specific installations, not participate in the crackdown.
"King Hamad's decree does not give the authorities a blank check to commit abuses," Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said Wednesday.
