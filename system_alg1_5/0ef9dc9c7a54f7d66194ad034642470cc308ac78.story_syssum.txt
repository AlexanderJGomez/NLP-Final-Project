After Obama sends his 2012 plan to Capitol Hill, House and Senate budget committees each pass their own budget resolutions, which set caps on spending and establish revenue targets and generally serve as five- to 10-year blueprints for congressional priorities.
Education is one of the few areas to get a significant increase in funding: $4.5 billion more than in his 2011 budget.
The $77.4 billion request would be spent on reforms, teacher training for STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and math) and reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, also known as No Child Left Behind.
The plan increases the Pentagon's base budget to $553 billion, $22 billion more than last year.
Obama's plan budgets $12 billion, which is roughly the same as in previous years, and increases land and water conservation programs.
The plan provides $47 billion for the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, a decrease of less than 1% from 2010.
The plan reduces funding for the African Development and Inter-American Foundations by nearly 20% and directs them to seek partnerships to leverage remaining funding.
