In the 24 hours she spent under the rubble, Vos, 57, said she gave up hope, and accepted she would die.
"I'm very lucky, I'm very, very lucky," she said.
There wouldn't have been time.
I was stuck there in a little cubby hole," she said.
Some time after those initial calls, Vos says she passed out.
Whatever it was, it changed her fortune.
Her son, Robert, gave her number to a Melbourne radio station, and soon conversations with her were being broadcast internationally.
I was just trapped under my desk, you know.
I am scared.
There are other anxieties too.
