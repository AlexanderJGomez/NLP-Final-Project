But suddenly, a horrific terrorist group emerges that calls itself the same name as your company.
OK, so nobody is going for option "B."
The most common reaction from business owners is option "A," dropping the ISIS reference.
In Queens, New York, the owner of the "ISIS Hookah CafÃ©" told the Daily News that he wants to change his name but can't afford the costs -- a new sign, documents and all.
And, yes, I know ISIS is a heinous organization.
The word Isis should conjure up mythology, not mayhem.
But what I really hope happens is that more businesses follow the lead of the California company, ISIS Pharmaceuticals, which is keeping its name.
So my advice is, if your company or product is called ISIS, keep the name.
