The first is the current box office champion, "Gravity," with the other being "The Butler."
Look, "Gravity" doesn't even pretend to be based on anything more than the screenwriter's imagination.
There was no "Cecil Gaines," the butler character played by Forest Whitaker in the film.
Sure, it was loosely inspired by the life of Eugene Allen, a man who served as a butler in the White House for 34 years for eight presidents, but the film was a fictionalized account.
Go to a movie, log off of Twitter, silence your phone, sit back, eat some overpriced cold popcorn that's part of the criminally expensive "value combo" and watch the film.
