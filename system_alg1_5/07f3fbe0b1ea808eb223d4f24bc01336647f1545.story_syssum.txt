Alleged cartel hit man Eduardo Ravelo has been added to the FBI's most wanted list.
He heads the Barrio Aztecas gang, but Ravelo isn't flashy, FBI agents say.
Officially, he's wanted on federal racketeering charges, but the FBI says Ravelo's criminal activities run much deeper.
He's also called "Two-by-four" and is believed to be  hiding with his wife and children, probably in a Barrio Aztecas-controlled neighborhood in Juarez, Mexico, just across the border from El Paso, Texas.
Drug cartel leaders often align themselves with street gangs, employing gang members to carry out some of the cartel's most vicious work.
Shortly after the murder, he became a Barrio Aztecas "capo," or captain.
While he may be staying out of sight, he's keeping up his violent work, Mikeska says, and he has the resources to do so.
