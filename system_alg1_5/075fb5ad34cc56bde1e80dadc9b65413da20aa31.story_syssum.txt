"I just saw an opportunity -- my mom is going through a divorce and I don't need this last name anymore," explained 30-year old entrepreneur Jason Sadler, who lives in Jacksonville, Florida.
The bidding ended December 13 on Sadler's website -- buymylastname.com -- and the winning bidder will pay $45,500 for Sadler to change his name to Jason Headsets.com.
Sadler, interviewed earlier in the week by CNN, rejects the idea that he is selling out.
"The reason I say that is that I don't want this last name anymore.
It's just not going to happen.
I have the last right of refusal."
