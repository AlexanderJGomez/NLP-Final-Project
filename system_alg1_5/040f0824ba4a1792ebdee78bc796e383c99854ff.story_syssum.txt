Seventy-four people, including 57 army officers, were killed in the mutiny at the headquarters of Bangladesh's border guards in Dhaka in February 2009.
The accused troopers were indicted on charges of murder, rape, arson, looting weapons and conspiracy.
According to the charges, the border guards took up weapons, killed the officers, and held the families of the officers hostage in the staff apartments inside the headquarters compound.
The dead also included the then-chief of the border guards, Maj. Gen. Shakil Ahmed, and his wife.
