Whatever you call the jihadist group known for killing dozens of people at a time, carrying out public executions, beheadings, crucifixions and other brutal acts, there is no denying they have captured the world's attention.
In April 2013, Islamic State in Iraq absorbed the al Qaeda-backed militant group in Syria, Jabhat al-Nusra, also known as the al-Nusra Front.
Of course, the Levant is larger than Syria," Bergen said.
It's the same word in Arabic.
Levant denotes Syria and Lebanon in Arabic, "so better to stick to ISIL and clarify that it's the same as ISIS, but a more accurate translation from the Arabic," he said.
Arabic speakers say al-Sham can be translated to mean the Levant, Syria, greater Syria, and even Damascus.
When people in the Arab world, use the term DAIISH, it's derogatory, according to Columbia's Khalidi.
"Those who disagree with them, call them DAIISH," Khalidi said, adding that the jihadists have objected to the name.
