A public inquiry is a different proceeding that would "enable the fullest possible investigation" into Alexander Litvinenko's death and, unlike an inquest, can receive evidence behind closed doors, the coroner said during Tuesday's hearing.
In a deathbed statement, Litvinenko blamed Putin, an accusation the Kremlin has strongly denied.
Emmerson charged Tuesday that a foreign office minister made what he said was an "improper approach" to Litvinenko's widow while British Prime Minister David Cameron and Putin met in Sochi, Russia, last month.
"I have to say I am astonished," Owen said about the contact.
As a matter of simple courtesy, the minister telephoned Mrs. Litvinenko to let her know of the fact of the meeting, not to discuss the contents, but simply to inform her," Garnham said.
In March, exiled Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky was found dead in the United Kingdom, and his death was deemed "consistent with hanging" with no sign of a violent struggle, British investigators said.
Last month, Edward Lucas, international editor of The Economist, told CNN's Fareed Zakaria that Litvinenko was a former security official -- akin to an FBI agent.
What we do know is that the British government doesn't want to get into detail about how they know about it, and that to me suggests that they were tapping Russian phones, reading Russian diplomatic communications, bugging Russian officers."
