In this case, it was once-in-a-lifetime Superstorm Sandy, which caused the outspoken Republican governor of New Jersey to declare a state of emergency and seek federal help for widespread devastation.
In particular, the Obama campaign challenges Romney's contention that increased economic growth from the tax cuts combined with shifting current federal responsibilities to states, the private sector and humanitarian agencies and charities can balance the budget.
Asked by moderator John King of CNN if disaster relief efforts should be turned over to states, Romney said that "every time you have an occasion to take something from the federal government and send it back to the states, that's the right direction.
King cut in to ask if Romney was referring specifically to disaster relief, a topic in the news at the time following a deadly Joplin, Missouri, tornado, and Romney continued: "We cannot afford to do those things without jeopardizing the future for our kids.
"As the first responders, states are in the best position to aid affected individuals and communities, and to direct resources and assistance to where they are needed most.
Period."
Vice President Joe Biden, meanwhile, said Tuesday that the federal response to Sandy was "working like it's supposed to," and he highlighted to reporters in Ohio what he described as unprecedented cooperation between city, state and federal authorities and agencies.
Republicans, driven by the party's conservative wing, call for immediate steps to erase the chronic budget deficits and mounting federal debt that they say imperil national security and stability.
"We've been able to get supplies, food, medicine, water, emergency generators, to ensure that hospitals and law enforcement offices are able to stay up and running as they are out there responding."
