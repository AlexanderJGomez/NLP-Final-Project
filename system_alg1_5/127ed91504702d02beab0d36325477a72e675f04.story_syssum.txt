Or maybe you took your short shorts from the gym to the office, like Gwyneth Paltrow.
Shorts are finally getting respect outside the park -- at the office, at dinner, and even on the red carpet, seen on the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Connelly.
Slip 'em off, though, and a menagerie appears.
Stars like Carey Mulligan embraced full-skirts and cinched waists -- not slouchy, super-sized menswear.
Not leggings, harems, dhotis, skinnies, cargos, boot-cuts or overalls, but tailored, comfortable, great-to-stride-in trousers?
Multiple chains, as seen on Molly Sims, are a subtle evolution from the statement necklace.
Minx or fox, they're not: Faux-fur vests like Kim Kardashian's are animal- and closet-friendly -- they're suitable toppers for almost anything.
