LONDON, England (CNN) -- The UK's Prince Harry has been serving on the frontline in Afghanistan and seen combat, but his deployment will be reviewed after the news was leaked by a U.S.
CNN, as well as other news organizations, chose to honor an embargo requested by the military.
"As far as I'm concerned, I'm out here as a normal JTAC on the ground and not as Prince Harry," he said.
Last year, the military ruled Harry could not be sent to Iraq because publicity about the deployment could put him and his unit at risk.
"His conduct on operations in Afghanistan has been exemplary," the general said.
Harry's brother, Prince William, is also an army officer.
But as second in line for the throne, he is specifically barred from combat.
