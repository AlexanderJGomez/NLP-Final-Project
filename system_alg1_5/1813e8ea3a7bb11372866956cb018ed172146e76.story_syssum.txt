The FDA hasn't determined whether tomatoes were a source of the outbreak, but it has determined that tomatoes currently in fields and stores are safe, said Dr. David Acheson, the FDA's associate commissioner for food protection, according to The Associated Press.
Many of the infected people were thought to have eaten tomatoes from farms in south Florida and parts of Mexico, but inspectors haven't found the outbreak strain on those farms, Acheson said, according to the AP.
Federal health investigators have visited farms in Florida, Texas and Mexico to try to determine the source of the outbreak, according to the CDC.
