When their national teams are playing, visiting police officers will be at Poland's police headquarters in Warsaw, the nerve-center for security operations during the event.
"The whole security plan is ready; the right equipment has been bought," says Mariusz Sokolowski, press officer for the Polish police force.
"We know what we deliver has to be the best, at the top level," says Beata Stelmach, Poland's Deputy Foreign Minister.
"The less we are visible and less we need to act the better the event will be as it will show that Euro 2012 will be a very safe event," says Sokolowski.
