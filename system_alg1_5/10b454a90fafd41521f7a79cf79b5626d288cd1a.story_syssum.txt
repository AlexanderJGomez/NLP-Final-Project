But it was too little, too late, as Argentina held on for a 2-1 victory.
It turns out the deciding goal was Argentina's second tally, by none other than Lionel Messi, arguably the world's greatest (and most scrutinized) player, who has a history of underperforming in the World Cup.
But entering this year's World Cup, much of the focus lay on Messi's lack of goal scoring in the 2010 tournament, which ended with a 4-0 Argentine loss to Germany in the quarterfinals.
Each one scored.
No kidding.
While the fans at the stadium watched replays and booed the referee's call, new goal line technology showed it was indeed a goal.
Only one of the replays showed the ball likely over the line, but on the screen, FIFA's animated representation indicated it was a goal by a few inches.
After Sunday's action there have been 37 goals in 11 matches, 16 more than during the same number of games in South Africa in 2010.
Ok, we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves; there are 52 matches left.
