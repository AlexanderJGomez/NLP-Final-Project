Manama, Bahrain (CNN) -- At least two people were killed early Thursday morning when Bahraini police swarmed into the capital, Manama, to roust protesters from the Pearl Roundabout, emergency hospital services said.
Most of the casualties have being sent to Salamaniya hospital, according to an operator at Manama's other main hospital, Bahrain International.
Inside the hospital's emergency treatment room, the scene was one of "complete, uncontrolled chaos," according to Robertson.
During the crackdown in Pearl Roundabout, an ABC reporter was attacked while he was on the phone, describing the scene for the network.
Finally, he returned to the audio line and told what had just happened.
"We were sleeping," he said.
"No one was doing anything," he said.
"The whole area here has been surrounded," he told CNN by telephone.
An hour after police moved in, the square, where thousands of people had been, was largely empty except for police.
Demonstrators picked up the body of Fadhel Matrook, 31, from a morgue Wednesday and marched to a cemetery with no police presence on the streets, said Nabeel Rajab, president of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights.
"It's a very relaxed atmosphere," Mansoor Al-Jamri, editor of the newspaper Al Wasat, had told CNN.
In a recent report, the group said Bahraini authorities detained 23 opposition political activists in August and September, and held them without contact for two weeks, "during which some allege they were tortured."
In Washington, the State Department said Tuesday it was "very concerned" by the violence and said it welcomed the promise of an investigation.
