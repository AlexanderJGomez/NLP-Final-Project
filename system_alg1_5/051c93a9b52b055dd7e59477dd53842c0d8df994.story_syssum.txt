Xiang first garnered attention for her sculptures of women.
A seated, slouching and vacant-eyed nude woman with a scar on her abdomen, sagging breasts and fat rolls, critic Gao Shiming, a dean at the China Academy of Art, has described the work as an expression of "fatigue ... emptiness and helplessness."
But, she says, "after a while, if you work on a deeper level, you will discover that whether male or female, you're ultimately dealing with human nature.
"Individuals are in fact very alien, very distant to each other.
In fact, she rejects the notion of inspiration altogether.
Xiang then uses clay to shape a form, from which a plaster mold is created, which she then paints.
"Every time when I work on something, I would eat very little and sleep very little and become very, very thin."
"I want my art to awaken the sensibility of each onlooker, to awaken his body, so that his body can experience the sculpture.
What that means for Xiang personally is not yet clear, though.
Being thrown into the cross currents of history is, she says, "good fortune" on one hand, but she also says, "I'm not very adaptable."
In fact, it can be enormous."
