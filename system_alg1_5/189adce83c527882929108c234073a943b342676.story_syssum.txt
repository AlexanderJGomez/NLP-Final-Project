Then came shale gas, tar sands, and other unconventional sources.
Solar, advanced nuclear fission, and fusion offer the best hope but, unfortunately, none are ready for large-scale deployment.
Of our three most promising technologies, fusion would be the biggest prize.
The catch is fusion is very hard to do.
This is an astonishing achievement.
There are other approaches to fusion -- for example the laser experiments at the National Ignition Facility in California -- but for many of us in the scientific trenches, the fusion burn on ITER is expected to be the defining moment.
Certainly, cost increases on ITER haven't helped.
We are, it seems, not taking the threat of climate change and energy shortages seriously.
Only if we sufficiently fund alternative energy research now.
