(CNN) -- When Black Caviar lines up at Morphetville, Adelaide, on Sunday in front of an anticipated crowd of 30,000, the Australian wonder horse will carry the weight not only of jockey Luke Nolen but the expectations of an entire nation.
Such is the aura of invincibility surrounding Black Caviar, she typically races against just a handful of other runners.
For Australians, Black Caviar's English endeavor is something of a national cause.
The only horse in the world with a higher rating than Black Caviar, the inevitable clamor for a showdown between the two best horses in the world is likely to reach deafening pitch should Black Caviar win again on Sunday.
Both horses are huge (Black Caviar stands at 16.2 HH while Zenyatta stood at a carthorse-like 17.2 HH), and their hulking frames meant they were each only lightly raced in their early years (larger horses usually take longer to develop).
Black Caviar was named by one of her owners, Pam Hawkes, who has a taste for the delicacy.
