Sartain, 58, who was ordained in 1978, most recently served as bishop of the Joliet, Illinois, diocese for four years.
After his ordination, Flores was accused of molesting a suburban Chicago boy over a five-year period beginning in 2005, SNAP leaders said, citing news accounts.
The Archdiocese of Seattle has said that once Sartain found out about the allegations, he reported them.
"A final word of thanks goes to my friend, Archbishop Brunett," Sartain said, whose remarks drew supportive applause.
