"Termination of cease-fire is our response to terrorists, insurgents, marauders ... and (those who) deprive people of normal peaceful life," Poroshenko said.
Three others were injured and hospitalized, the ministry said.
Police successfully fought back the attack, the ministry said on its website.
The fragile cease-fire expired at midnight Monday, hours after Poroshenko spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande.
Putin, addressing Russian diplomats in Moscow, said he regretted the decision to end the cease-fire.
Russia's ambassador to the European Union, Vladimir Chizhov, said Tuesday that the refusal to extend the cease-fire is a "negative sign," the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Twitter.
"We need only military actions," a priest named Valentyn said in a Reuters interview.
After Monday's phone call, Poroshenko said his goal was peace but insisted it takes the participation of all parties to maintain stability, noting violations of the cease-fire by pro-Russia separatists.
"There is definitely no need for an extension of the truce," he said.
"Bloody military actions are better than such bloody truce," she said.
