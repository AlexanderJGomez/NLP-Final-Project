Of the 87 percent of the votes counted by Monday morning, the Ata Zhurt party had won 8.6 percent, said Nuriya Iskanderova, a consultant for the commission.
Voter turnout was high, especially in the south of the country, she said, including a 56 percent turnout in the capital, Bishkek.
Shortly after that, Kyrgyz voters approved a new constitution that puts more power in the hands of parliament, reducing the president's role.
Nearly 2.9 million people were eligible to vote for 120 lawmakers in a parliament called the Jogorku Kenesh, the Central Election Commission said.
