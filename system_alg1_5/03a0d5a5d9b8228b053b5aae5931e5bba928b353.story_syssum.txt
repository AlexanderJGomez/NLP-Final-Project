Today, Germany is the world's fourth largest economy, and the most important market in the European Union.
On November 9, 1989, a group of excited Berliners used mauls, chisels, hammers and fists to smash down the wall that divided the West and East part of the city.
"Part of the success story of the German multinationals was their capacity to use the opportunities that arose -- first with reunification, and secondly with the expansion of the EU," said Fredrik Erixon, director of the European Centre for International Political Economy, a Brussels-based think tank.
Germany turned into one of the world's largest exporters by going even further east to the emerging Asian markets, especially China and India, according to Irwin Collier, professor of economics at Free University Berlin.
In addition, thousands of medium-sized companies, often family owned, have been successful internationally and particularly in Asia, according to Anke Hassel, professor of public policy at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin.
But it's not all rosy.
According to Hassel, Germany's dependence on exports make it very vulnerable.
In the quarter of a century that has passed since the Berliners tore down that wall, Germany has, no doubt, become an economic superpower.
