Suleman -- known in tabloids as "Octomom" -- has not been arrested, but she has been ordered to appear before a Los Angeles County judge for her initial arraignment Friday, according to the district attorney's office.
"This is not a new career for her," her rep, Gina Rodriguez, told CNN in June when asked about her stripping gig.
"I wouldn't even kiss somebody for money," Suleman told CNN's Nischelle Turner.
"I've got to win the battle," she said.
Suleman faces up to five years, eight months in prison if convicted, the prosecutor said.
