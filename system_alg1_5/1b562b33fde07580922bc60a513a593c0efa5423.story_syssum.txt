David Kwiatkowski worked in 13 hospitals in eight states between January 2007 and July 2012, when he was arrested in a Massachusetts hotel room "in an intoxicated state," according to court documents.
"Many health care professionals were seeking the flexibility that contract work allowed and were leaving hospitals with vacancies," Berchem said.
But those temporary employees play an important role in hospitals, Berchem said.
Still, the Kwiatkowski case raises questions about the hiring process for both temporary and permanent health care workers.
The staffing agency that employed Kwiatkowski at the time, SpringBoard, reported the incident to the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists, according to a spokeswoman for the agency.
Scott Schnierer, vice president of business development for Comforce Staffing Services, said that most staffing firms conduct a seven-year background check on potential employees.
"We insure them, we pay their payroll taxes.
If there is a problem with an employee, hospitals are asked to report it to the staffing firm, he said.
And it's not just a problem for staffing firms.
"The system is only as good as the information available."
