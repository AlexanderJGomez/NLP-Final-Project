Greg Bernal of Florissant, Missouri, and girlfriend Janet Momphard of St. Charles, Missouri, on Tuesday hauled what is believed to be a world record catfish into their boat while fishing on the Missouri River.
His head broke the water and man, that was it, I knew I had a record breaker," Bernal said.
"Him and his girlfriend were jumping up and down because when it went over 100 pounds, they knew they had a state record, but when it went up to 130 pounds, they was really excited," said Blair.
"Back in 1995, I caught the Illinois state record catfish -- a blue that weighed 79.12 pounds," said Bernal.
Bernal is keeping the catfish, for the time being, in a friend's deep freezer.
I was just lucky, but I'm not going to argue with it, that's a world record," Bernal said.
