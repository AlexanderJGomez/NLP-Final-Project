No one in the concert hall knew that, as they took their seats for the performance, their president had been fatally shot in Dallas.
And that, Silverstein recalled, is when this very normal day was shattered.
The orchestra's music director, Erich Leinsdorf, was going to have to break the news to the audience.
We hope that it is unconfirmed, but we have to doubt it," Leinsdorf told the audience.
Some left the hall, but the majority remained.
Playing his violin for the remainder of the program, 30 minutes of a very surreal experience, Silverstein could barely concentrate on the music.
The shooting of the president was the "first time anyone of us had been confronted with the situation," he said.
