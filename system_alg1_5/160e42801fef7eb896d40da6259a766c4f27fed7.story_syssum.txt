GN: No, I grew up in Lagos, I was born and bred there and I don't see myself leaving that town any time soon.
GN: I don't think I ever realized that, for a long time I kept thinking, OK, this is just temporary, definitely I'm going to go back to school and read law, English or something that I wanted to do.
GN: Oh yes, I don't even need to wake up, just sitting down sometimes I'm like, God, sometimes I hate my life.
GN: I want to be further challenged in my career, I don't think I have reached my peak necessarily so I hope for other opportunities, greater opportunities to express myself.
