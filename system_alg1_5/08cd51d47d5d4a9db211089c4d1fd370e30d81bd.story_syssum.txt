Roma fans nearby set about attacking the bus, the spokesman said.
Police were quick to arrive and the bus managed to move on to safety, where the fan was treated for the wound, he said.
In 2007, Manchester United fans were injured after violence in two separate incidents with Roma fans when the teams met in Rome.
In 2003 five England fans suffered gunshot wounds during a violent incident in Zurich, Switzerland, before the side played a Euro 2004 qualifier with Liechtenstein.
