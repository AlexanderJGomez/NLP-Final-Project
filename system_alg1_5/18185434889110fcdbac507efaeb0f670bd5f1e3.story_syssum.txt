The crisis is unfolding as leaders of the G-20 group of nations meet in Cannes, France, for economic talks, amid fears that a debt default in Greece could send shock waves through the global economy.
If he loses the vote, the government would go into caretaker status until early elections can be held, said Heather Conley, senior fellow and director of the Europe Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state.
In that case, it would be likely that the conservatives would win the most votes but would not have a parliamentary majority, forcing them to form a coalition government, said Kostas Gemenis, an assistant professor of politics at the University of Twente in the Netherlands.
That option would give greater stability, as it would avoid elections, and could ensure that Greece stayed in the euro and the European Union, said Gemenis.
But Greece could find it hard to put the cat back in the bag now it's been allowed out, Conley said.
The recent crisis has prompted talk of a "democracy deficit," she said, as people in the different countries within the European Union complain that they have no say in important issues.
There are already signs that Greece's domestic banking system is starting to seize up amid the doubts over future European funding, Conley said.
Europe must put provisions in place to allow Greece to leave the euro, if that becomes necessary, with minimum damage, she said.
"The priority now is to focus not on Greece but on the rest of Europe, in particular Italy, which is the country most likely to be affected," she said.
