(CNN) -- Urban transport in Bolivia's administrative capital of La Paz has always been about what goes up and down.
As it currently stands, "one person coming in the morning from El Alto to the south area spends between one and a half and two hours to reach his destination," explained Javier Telleria, CEO of Doppelmayr Bolivia, the company behind the project.
With the gondola, this same journey will "take 24 minutes."
When these projects have been successful, they have brought with them a wide range of social and economic benefits.
"Being able to connect people from an island, which is what these barrios often are, to the wider city where they can access economic, social and cultural opportunities, that's the real value," Dale said.
"It's a nice bit of tourist infrastructure but it's not a serious mass transit solution in this part of London," Biggs said.
"There are (also) other parts of the world like across shipping lanes where they can in fact be quite useful, but none of these things really applied to London," Biggs added.
