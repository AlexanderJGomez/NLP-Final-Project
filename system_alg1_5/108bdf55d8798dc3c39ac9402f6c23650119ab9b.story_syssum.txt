If anything, Frieden has been consistent since the epidemic broke out in West Africa, and then eventually spread to the United States.
But we know how to stop it," he said last week.
"Difficult taking anything (the CDC and) Frieden say seriously," conservative radio host Tammy Bruce said on Twitter, citing low confidence in what she sees as lies or guessing on the issue.

It has to be fully enforced," she added.
"You know it sounds wonky and uninteresting, but when it comes down to it, that's what we want to do."
"He didn't say, 'I'm going to halve the cases of TB,'" Bassett said.
That was a decision based on data, she said.

"So, it wouldn't matter to him how many letters you had behind your name (from) all of your degrees," Bassett said.
In his career, Frieden, a graduate of Oberlin and Columbia, has undoubtedly over-achieved and saved thousands of lives.
It's risky.
