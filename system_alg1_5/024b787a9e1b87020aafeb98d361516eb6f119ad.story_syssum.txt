Phillip Garrido, who with his wife is charged in the 1991 kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard, had been convicted of kidnapping before.
In her testimony, Hall said Garrido asked for a ride in her car, then bound and handcuffed her before taking her to a small warehouse in Reno, Nevada, where he repeatedly raped her for 5Â½ hours.
It was as if I had to explain why I wasn't 'normal,' " she said.
The trial transcript reveals that Garrido told authorities that one hour before Hall's kidnapping, he tried to kidnap another woman, who wrestled away and escaped.
In the case involving Hall, CNN reviewed the 1977 trial documents, which include Garrido's psychiatric evaluation and the testimony of Hall and Garrido.
Hall, too, was taken directly to a carefully prepped small warehouse after her kidnapping.
"I asked him, couldn't we just pull over and get it over with," she testified.
On the other side of an unassuming metal, garage-style door, the walls were covered in long, heavy rugs hanging from the ceiling.
At the center was a mattress covered with an old, red satin, hole-ridden sheet and a fur blanket, Hall testified.
"He knew what he was doing," she testified.
Like Hall, she obliged.
"She jumped out of the vehicle, struggling with him," prosecutors told the judge during a private conversation during the trial.
The court documents also discussed Garrido's use of marijuana, cocaine and LSD, which Garrido said was so heavy it fueled his sexual desires and sometimes pushed him to a point he could no longer control them.
Sometimes, he said, he would open the car door, get out and pull down his pants.
Hall was curious, too, even during her kidnapping, what would make Garrido do this to her.
"He said that he didn't get off on pain," Hall recalled during her testimony.
