"My experience was, 'wow,'" said Raymond, who plied the waters as a representative of the Los Angeles River Expeditions and the Los Angeles Kayak Club.
After public pressure and leadership from a local councilman and the corps' commander, officials at several levels of government created the Los Angeles River Pilot Recreation Zone along a lush segment that features tree-lined islands, vistas of the San Gabriel Mountains and abundant wildlife such as herons, egrets, hawks and kingfishers.
And, yes, there are even fish in the river -- carp, catfish and bass -- and anglers can drop a line as long as they have a state permit.
Raymond, who's in her 40s, compared the Los Angeles River to New York City's Hudson and East rivers, where she took up kayaking.

"People were downright giddy to get into a kayak on the Los Angeles River," he said.
"'Cool' is a good word for it," Walker said.
And it didn't smell, which many people worried about," she said.

They can truly identify a river in the city, he said.
"Today, it's a front yard," Reyes declared.
