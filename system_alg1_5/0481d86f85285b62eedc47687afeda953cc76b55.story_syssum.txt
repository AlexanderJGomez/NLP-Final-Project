Cosby's attorney in the case, Walter M. Phillips Jr., called the allegations "utterly preposterous" and "plainly bizarre" at the time, yet in a civil filing, Constand's lawyers said they had found 13 "Jane Does" with similar stories.
Castor, who was the district attorney for Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, when Constand came forward in 2005, now tells CNN he thought Constand was credible, and he thought Cosby was evasive in his interview with prosecutors.
"Back then, the desire on our part to move forward was pretty strong," he said.
Of Cosby's interview with prosecutors, Castor said, "I thought he was lying.
No, I didn't," he said.
And I remember a lot of pain," she said.
His attorney, Martin Singer, addressed Dickinson's allegations specifically in a statement, calling them a "fabricated lie" and saying they contradicted what she wrote in her autobiography and what she said during a 2002 New York Observer interview.
"I woke up out of a very confused state not in my clothes," she said.
