Edinburgh, Scotland (CNN) -- Let's not pretend Queen Elizabeth doesn't have opinions.
Her grandson, Prince William, also appeared to step into the debate, according to some newspapers, when he was asked about his wife's second pregnancy on the day it was announced.
"The Queen is above politics and those in political office have a duty to ensure that this remains the case," said the spokeswoman.
She's done this by refusing to take sides, in public at least.
The frontman of the pro-independence campaign, Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, says he looks forward to the Queen remaining as "Queen of Scots" in an independent Scotland.
Factor in that her mother was Scottish and it's intrinsically personal too.
Empires may come and go, but the Queen's facing the break-up of her home country.
It's personal and professional for her.
