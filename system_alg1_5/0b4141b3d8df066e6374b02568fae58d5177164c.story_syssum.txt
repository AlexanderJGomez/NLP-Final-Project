As the clashes between stone-hurling loyalists and knife-wielding Salafis escalated, police fired tear gas to disperse them and traded a volley of stones with Salafi supporters, witnesses said.
Shiekh Saad Hneiti, a senior leader of the Jordanian Salafist movement, denied that there had been any premeditated attack, insisting that protesters picked up arms only in self-defense after coming under attack by pro-monarchy supporters.
"Our demands are pure and just and clear: we want our brothers freed from prison and to be governed by the Holy Quran, which most Jordanians support," Hneiti said.
"Today with the revolutions sweeping the Arab world, Jordanians are taking to the street asking for the same slogans, freedom, social justice, because after the signing of the Wadi Araba Treaty with Israel, things have been deteriorating," Naffa said.
Most of them, unlike demonstrators in Arab countries that have seen uprisings, have not been seeking regime change but changes to the regime.
Mohamad Khateeb, a spokesman for the public security directorate, said Friday's demonstrations in Amman were peaceful.
