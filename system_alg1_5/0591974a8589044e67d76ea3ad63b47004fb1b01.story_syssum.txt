Police also arrested a third man wanted by authorities for belonging to the same clan, but not directly linked to the killings.
"This is a great day for the Italian state," said Carmelo Casabona, head of the police in Caserta.
"Our objective is to take the water away from the sharks," said Italian Interior Minister Roberto Maroni.
Authorities also arrested dozens of other people, including the wife of Francesco Schiavone, aka "Sandokan," the head of the Casalesi clan who was arrested a decade ago and is serving a life-time prison sentence.
