Brian K. Vaughan says he's "depressed" about the end of "Y: The Last Man," but he's got other projects to work on.
"I guess I've moved into acceptance but that doesn't mean that I'm not still depressed about it," says Vaughan, 31, a soft-spoken Cleveland, Ohio, native who now makes his home in Los Angeles.
"First, you finish the script, but then it still has to be penciled and inked, and there's so many stages in comics that it's sort of been like the stages of death."
"It's not like we were destined for a long and successful run," he adds, smiling.
"It'll be a drag not to get to spend more time with these characters," observes Vaughan.
Meanwhile, Vaughan's other work in comics, including "Ex Machina" (Wildstorm) and "Runaways" (Marvel), has captured the attention of Hollywood.
Meanwhile, Vaughan, a one-time film student, has begun a career in television, working as a writer on ABC's "Lost."
Despite the accolades and opportunities, Vaughan sees his growth, both personally and professionally, as very much a work in progress.
But I'm a comic book writer," he continues, "so I'm still a big dumb child, and I think I always will be."
