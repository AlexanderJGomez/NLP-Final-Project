Tony Fernandes, CEO of Air Asia, spoke to CNN's Andrew Stevens in The Boardroom.
So I think that was one of the things, that I didn't have a lot to lose.
So that drove me.
Fernandes: No, I knew Malaysians very well.
If that's there, everything is surmountable because people power is strong.
Fernandes: Oh yes, they do.
And that's a very motivating thing.
Fernandes: I have less time, but I still do it.
You change but the vision's still the same.
