With the release of her new LP, "Stars Dance," the world is getting a glimpse of a more adult Gomez.
Before, I would have maybe a month or two to record an album, and I'd have to do my series at the same time and tour on the weekends.
Gomez began acting professionally at a young age, nabbing roles in children's programs such as "Barney and Friends."
To me, it's that easy.
"Stars Dance" is a very personal album, Gomez said.
Dancing so much, singing constantly, just getting it tight.

I'm super-stoked with where this is, and hopefully it will continue to just get better."
