Joe Dinardo, left, and Clark Dever will be spending only 12 hours in each city before going to their next stop.
Dever, who was recently saving up money to be a professional photographer, quit his job, and Dinardo decided to use all of his accumulated vacation time from his job to take the trip.
And for them, the price is unbeatable.
She decided that with the buzz on Twitter, she could start organizing a group of fellow all-you-can-jet travelers, calling it the 599club.
Will and Cara Dearman had been planning to move to New York from Austin, Texas, when they heard about the deal.
Though Dever and Dinardo may have the most exhausting schedule, they, like many others, think that if nothing else, the trip will be a true adventure.
"No matter what happens, there will certainly be a story that comes out of this trip," Dever said.
