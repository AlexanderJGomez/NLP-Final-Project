Los Angeles (CNN) -- A top AEG executive referred to Michael Jackson as "the freak" and another called him "creepy" just hours before their company signed the pop icon to a huge concert deal.
"No," Trell answered.
Interesting for sure, but kind of creepy."
Panish asked Trell.
Murray signed his contract the day before Jackson's June 25, 2009, death, but AEG executives and Jackson never put their signatures on it.
Panish -- the Jackson family's lead lawyer -- questioned Trell Thursday about his previous testimony that there were no "red flags" to alert AEG executives about Jackson's declining health.
When Panish suggested Prince had not had "a very favorable experience" with AEG, Trell said he'd not spoken to him about it.
