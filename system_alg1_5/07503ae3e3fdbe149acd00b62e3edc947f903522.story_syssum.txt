One day after Ai Weiwei was released on bail, the dissident artist remained at home, unable to speak with anyone about why he was detained or what awaits him now.
Ai's release came without much fanfare.
"I'm fine," he said.
Ai was seized April 3 while planning to board a plane to Hong Kong and later accused of economic crimes, a move that prompted international condemnation and added to criticism over China's controversial record on human rights.
Beijing police accused him of evading a "huge amount" of taxes, Xinhua reported in May, more than a month after he was detained.
On China's cyberspace, Ai's name is nowhere to be found, censored out of existence.
International reporting on Ai, including on CNN, was blacked out.
"He's not the only one.
This has happened many times before," said Cohen, also a professor at NYU School of Law.
But for now, Ai will have to be silent.
