The structure, a 94-by-94-foot building, was the location where Tesla hoped to develop wireless communications and clean, free energy for everyone in the early 1900s.
Matthew Inman, the creator of Web cartoon "The Oatmeal," is joining forces with a nonprofit group, The Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe, to help preserve the facility as a science center and museum honoring "the father of the electric age."
"Tesla is an unsung hero, and there are very few monuments to him in the United States.
This current effort, bluntly titled "Let's Build a Goddamn Tesla Museum," exploded after it was launched, raising more than $750,000 within five days.
Inman said he was shocked by how much, and how quickly, people have donated to save Tesla's lab.
"Tesla, for the past year or two on the Internet, has risen as a cult hero to geek people," Inman said.
Jane Alcorn, president of the Tesla Science Center, said he moved into offices in New York City later, but Wardenclyffe was his final experimental location.
"Tesla foresaw the wireless transmissions we do with our cell phones and our laptops," Alcorn said.
The property changed hands a couple more times and is currently owned by Agfa-Gevaert, a technology company based in Belgium.
"When we heard that, and there was a letter of interest with a price involved, all of that made us a little bit wary and concerned because someone could come along and purchase this property before we had an opportunity to make an offer, " she said.
If the group is  successful in its bid, she expects it will be a couple of years before the museum opens, while additional funding and exhibits are arranged.
