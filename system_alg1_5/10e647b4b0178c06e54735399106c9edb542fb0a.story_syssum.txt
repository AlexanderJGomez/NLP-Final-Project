Joe Jackson, father of Michael Jackson, attends the BET Awards on Sunday in Los Angeles, California.
He was "the greatest star in the world," Joseph Jackson, father of the late entertainer, said on Sunday night.
But I wish he was here to see all this, to hear all this."
The awards opened with a fleet-footed New Edition, with Bobby Brown, performing an energized version of the Jackson 5 hit "The Love You Save," to raucous praise.
"If it wasn't for Michael Jackson, people like Justin Timberlake would be selling curly fries in the valley," the actor said.
The presenters included the past and present Uhura of "Star Trek": Zoe Saldana, who starred in the film, and Nichelle Nichols of the TV show.
It's truly been a labor of love for us," Lee said.
