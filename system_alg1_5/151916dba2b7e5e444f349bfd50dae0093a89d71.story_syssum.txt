(CNN) -- Gore Vidal, the eclectic author who faithfully chronicled the major shifts and upheavals in the United States in books, essays and plays, has died.
"He was the godfather of gay literature in spite of himself," said Christopher Bram, author of "Eminent Outlaws," a profile of the groundbreaking homosexual authors of Vidal's era.
He riled the right by saying the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks occurred because the Bush administration was "incompetent" and Bush himself was "inactive and inopportune."
The more they communicated, the more impressed he was by McVeigh, Vidal said.
Vidal "was always a gadfly," Bram said.
"Well, I mean I won the debates, there was no question of that," Vidal recounted in a CNN interview in 2007.
"And you know, we must honor them because they are so few."
His grandfather, T.P.
"He was very good, he was extraordinary, he was my education."
But it was his third novel, the coming-out tale "The City and the Pillar," that brought him notoriety.
As a result of the controversy, "He backed away from the subject for a while," said Bram, who teaches English at New York University.
The newspaper, along with others, would not review his future work, forcing Vidal, the pariah, to write mysteries under the pseudonym Edgar Box -- and to turn to Hollywood.
"I would say that since 1945, the United States, which was absolutely the 'mandate of heaven,' as Confucius would say, had fallen upon us," he told CNN in 2007.
"We share a plot, and I'll be there," Vidal said.
"And I'll be looking forward to seeing him."
