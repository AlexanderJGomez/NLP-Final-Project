In Tunica, Mississippi, two casinos reopened after being shut for almost three weeks because of the flooding, said Caesars Entertainment, the company that owns and operates them.
The rain could lead to secondary crests and higher crests along the Mississippi from Memphis, Tennessee, southward, he said.
It was a big success, he said.
"(I'm) just here to celebrate the river cresting," Roland said.
"We talked about it and thought about it, but this really wasn't a decision at all," one of the holdouts, Cindy Roberson, told WLBT.
Flooded houses pose a variety of dangers, they said.
Warren County, which includes Vicksburg, has "several hundred homes that have water" and about 2,000 residents have been displaced, Sheriff Martin Pace said.
Water levels in Natchez, a city about 70 miles south, are nearly 4 feet beyond the record.
"It will take about a full week to repair," she said.
By Saturday morning, "the area will be secured and no one will be allowed to enter," the parish said in a news release.
It will be weeks before the river falls below flood stage, allowing evacuees to return.
It has affected nine states so far: Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi.
