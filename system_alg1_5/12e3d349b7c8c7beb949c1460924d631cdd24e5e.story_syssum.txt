But if the state of Texas has its way, Reed will be executed without those tests ever being conducted.
Fennell, according to affidavits, was irate that his fiancÃ©e, a white woman, was having an affair with Reed, who is African-American.
The best explanation for the state's aversion to the testing may be the dread of learning the truth.
The prospect of finding that Reed is innocent would deliver a resounding condemnation of the state's criminal justice process -- its detectives, prosecutors, defense attorneys, judges, jurors and appellate courts.
Michael Morton spent almost 25 years in prison for the murder of his wife, a conviction that would likely have been averted but for the misconduct of the prosecutor, Ken Anderson.
Moreover, Anderson, who had since become a district judge in Williamson County, was disbarred for his acts and briefly carted off to jail.
But the state has an obligation to Reed, and to its citizenry in whose name it is about to execute Reed, to test every bit of remaining evidence.
