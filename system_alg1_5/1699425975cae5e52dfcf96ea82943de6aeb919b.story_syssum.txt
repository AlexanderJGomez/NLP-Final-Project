That they were filed under the copyist's name, not Franklin's, may explain why they were overlooked by historians until now, said a curator at the British Library, where the letters are held.
"The first item was a letter from Benjamin Franklin to the secretary of the governor of Maryland, and I looked at it and I started to read, and I thought, 'This doesn't look familiar,'" Houston told CNN.
"I swear, I just about shot through the ceiling I was so excited," he said.
Braddock started to blame his hosts, so Franklin -- the Pennsylvania assembly's leading politician -- stepped in to help.
Eventually, Franklin managed to get the farmers to agree, and within weeks, Braddock and his men were on the march.
This collection of letters, which Franklin referred to in his autobiography as his "quire book," was never found, however -- until now.
"Birch undoubtedly found Franklin's quire book captivating, and he appears to have copied anything that remotely interested him," Houston writes in the journal.
"It's the first time they've really been shared with a wider audience," Shaw told CNN.
