It's no surprise, then, that scientists around the world are investigating whether living cells can be used to print replacement organs and tissues.
Instead, printers are a vehicle for scaling up and automating a process that must begin at the laboratory bench.
Engineered airways, bladders, blood vessels and urine tubes have been successfully implanted.
With a pipette, cells were then added by hand to these structures.
An ultimate goal of bioprinting, of course, is to be able to print complex structures such as kidneys that can help solve the shortage of organs available for transplant.
Instead, even when printed structures are made with living cells, they must "incubate" in the body to become fully functional.
For example, for the military-funded Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine, our team is working to print smaller tissues, such as bone and muscle, that would be used in facial reconstruction.
In addition, in collaboration with five other institutions, we are working to print miniature hearts, lungs, blood vessels and livers onto "chips" that will be connected with a blood substitute.
It is important to remember, though, that the process involves more than putting cells in a cartridge and pressing "print."
