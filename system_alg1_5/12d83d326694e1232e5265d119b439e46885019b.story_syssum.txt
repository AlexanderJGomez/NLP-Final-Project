The protesters -- known as the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD) -- support Thaksin Shinawatra, who was prime minister from 2001 to 2006, before he was ousted in a bloodless coup.
Following protests that have paralyzed parts of Bangkok for months, the army surged on Wednesday into Lumpini Park, with armored personnel carriers crushing bamboo and tire barricades, while protesters hurled M79 grenades at soldiers.
At least five people, including an Italian journalist, were listed as killed by the Police Hospital in Bangkok.
Seven anti-government protest leaders had been taken into custody, while several others fled, authorities said.
