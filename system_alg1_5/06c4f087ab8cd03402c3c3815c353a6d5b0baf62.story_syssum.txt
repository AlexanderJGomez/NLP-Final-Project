Berlin (CNN) -- More than 300 wounded Libyans will arrive in Germany to be treated in hospitals within the next 10 days in an operation approved by Libya's interim government, the German Foreign Ministry said Friday.
Libya's National Transitional Council requested the U.S. medical treatment, which is being offered as a humanitarian gesture and support for Libya's democratic aspirations, U.S. officials said.
Four days later, the first military plane arrived in Germany with dozens of wounded Libyans.
Many wounded Libyans had already received treatment in Tunisia, according to Blasius.
