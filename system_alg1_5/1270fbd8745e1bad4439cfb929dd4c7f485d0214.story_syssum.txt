"It was thrilling to be in Iran, just plain old thrilling," said Ganis.
In Iran, "the language of movies" has thrived since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, despite strict censorship laws, said Duke professor Negar Mottahedeh, author of "Displaced Allegories: Post-Revolutionary Iranian Cinema."
"At the moment, I think [Iranian cinema] does have wide exposure," Mottahedeh said.
"Iranian melodrama from the 1960s and 1970s replicates American melodrama," she said.
But a lot of what they're able to dramatize is limited," Horberg said.
"When a film is banned, people are even more eager to see it," Dabashi said, pointing out that many Iranians acquire films through the black market.
Dabashi said Iranian cinema has been prominent on the international scene for years, adding that many Iranian actors are beginning to cross over to the American film industry -- from veteran Iranian film actress Shohreh Aghdashloo, who starred opposite Ben Kingsley in 2003's "House of Sand and Fog," to newcomer Golshifte Farahani, who starred as Leonardo DiCaprio's love interest in the 2008 thriller "Body of Lies."
"This was very special to them," Sayah said.
"It's a start," Ganis said.
