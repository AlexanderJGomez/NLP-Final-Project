His name is Khin Zaw Lin.
Lin is one of about 300 refugees in the dump who survive on other people's trash.
Lin pokes through the rubbish with a machete.
When we arrive at the dump, people are afraid of us.
I tell them I want to help, and I am eventually directed to Lin.
Lin gives the money to his adopted mother.
She found a garbage dump instead.
Perhaps it's because Lin is invisible -- he doesn't have a passport or papers.
But Lin's story angers me.
Near the end of my meeting with Lin, I ask his adopted mother if she, and Lin, would ever escape the rubbish dump.
