Meanwhile, talks between South Sudan's government and rebels began Monday in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
"The two delegations appreciated the gravity of the situation and the need and urgency of resolving the crisis in South Sudan.
Stopping the fighting in South Sudan is not only a humanitarian imperative but also a strategic necessity, in order to halt the rapid descent of Africa's newest nation into collapse."
South Sudan seceded from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war, making it the world's youngest nation.
Prolonged fighting has cut South Sudan's oil output, affecting both economies.
