The compromise amendment by Republicans John Hoeven of North Dakota and Bob Corker of Tennessee would increase border security, a demand by conservative opponents of the immigration bill.
"I hope our colleagues in the House of Representatives will follow the Senate's lead, and work to pass bipartisan reform that both Democrats and Republicans can support," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said before Wednesday's votes.
Fleming, a Louisiana Republican, said Boehner told the weekly policy meeting that the House would work on its own immigration bills.
If eventually passed into law and signed by President Barack Obama, the bill would be the first major immigration reform since 1986, during the second Reagan administration.
Grassley conceded he voted for the 1986 measure, which also called for increased border security, and called his support then a mistake he regrets.
But the status quo on immigration "is hurting America," he added.
