The olinguito is the first mammalian carnivore species to be newly identified in the Americas in 35 years, according to Kristofer Helgen, curator of mammals at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History.
"It was in museums, it's been in zoos, and its DNA had even been sequenced, but no one had connected the pieces and looked close enough to realize, basically, the significance of this remarkable and this beautiful animal," Helgen said.
Previously, scientists had assumed that olinguitos were members of their sister species, the olingos, Helgen said.
On their very first night on the pursuit, the team found a real, living olinguito.
Even people who live in the Andes had the same confusion about olinguitos being olingos, because humans don't hunt them and the creatures stay in the trees, Helgen said.
The olinguito's misty high-elevation habitats in Colombia and Ecuador, and the tendency for the animal to stay in the trees, have helped keep the species relatively obscure to scientists until now, Helgen said.
The olinguito is not yet considered an endangered species, but there are threats to its home environment, Helgen said.
Helgen's group has "discovered" the olinguito, but it been evolving as an independent species for about 3 to 4 million years, he said.
"It wasn't because she was fussy, it was because she was not at all even the same species," Helgen said.
