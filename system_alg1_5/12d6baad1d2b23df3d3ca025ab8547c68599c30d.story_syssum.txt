The boy's high school that was destroyed was located in Mingora, the valley's main city, said Sher Afzal Khan, an education officer for Swat.
Swat Valley, located in North West Frontier Province, was once Pakistan's biggest tourist destination.
The bomb, planted on a bicycle, went off in the town of Dera Ismail Khan, said Mohammad Riaz of the province's police force.
It killed shopkeepers and pedestrians, added the town's police chief, Abdul Rashid.
