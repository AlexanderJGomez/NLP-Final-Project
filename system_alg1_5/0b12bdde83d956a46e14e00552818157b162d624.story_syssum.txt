Anna Nicole Smith, with Howard K. Stern, was found dead in her hotel room in February 2007.
Freeman said Thompson later told him that he found Eroshevich, a psychiatrist, to be "way out of her league" in her requests for strong drugs for Smith.
Under questioning by the defense, Freeman said that over the previous five years he had filled prescriptions for Smith, he never saw any "red flags" that she was getting dangerous amounts of drugs.
It was a practice begun in 2001, three years before Kapoor or Eroshevich began treating her, to prevent "trouble for her in terms of her celebrity status," Freeman said.
"She manipulated Dr. Eroshevich," he said.
Seven of them were prescribed using Stern's name, although spelled "Stearn," he said.
