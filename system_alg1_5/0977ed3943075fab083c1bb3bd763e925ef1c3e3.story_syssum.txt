(CNN)  -- Beverly Hills, California, police want Lindsay Lohan to turn herself in on an arrest warrant issued Friday.
Once arrested, Lohan, 22, could go free after posting a $50,000 bond, Foxen said.
A judge sentenced Lohan to three years' probation after she entered guilty and no-contest pleas to the charges.
Her pop music recording career, boosted by her movie roles, has floundered.
