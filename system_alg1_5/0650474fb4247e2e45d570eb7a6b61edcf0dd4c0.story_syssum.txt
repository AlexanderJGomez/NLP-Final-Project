Historically, the planning and design of mass transit systems involved a team of experienced professionals working exclusively with those from other key stakeholder groups.
The alpha version of the Hyperloop design published by Musk on Monday seems like a carefully engineered "lego" transit system with capsules supported on air bearings, the main tube placed on pylons and covered with solar arrays, and advanced propulsion systems.
The distance that separates any two adjacent capsules, called the headway, is a critical design parameter, and it will need to account for additional speed changes and halts that may occur during real operating conditions.
Needless to say, the possibilities for improvements are endless.
Already, the Hyperloop has provoked comparisons with the predominant modes of transport between the two megacities, San Francisco and Los Angeles.
Still, if it is realized, it will be faster than plane, car, or high speed rail.
Hyperloop, let's hope we can take a ride before the decade's end.
