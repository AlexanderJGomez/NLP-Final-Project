There are a few thousand Egyptians left in Tunisia awaiting evacuation after more than 40,000 were taken home, said Firas Kayal, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency, on Saturday.
But others, including Egyptians and Bangladeshis, have been left to fend for themselves.
Meanwhile, three people died and 14 were missing when they tried to get off a ship headed from Libya's capital, Tripoli, to Crete, the Greek Ministry for the Protection of Civilians said Sunday.
Previously, they averaged 10,000 to 15,000 people.
"A lot of them were scared from leaving because of the fighting so they were staying in their houses," he said Saturday.
