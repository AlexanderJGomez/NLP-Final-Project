In a country where politics has always been about scandal and spectacle, it's showtime once again.
If this sounds like an old script, it's because it is.
As president, he vowed to bring Arroyo to trial.
In particular, they see the ombudsman and the chief justice, both Arroyo loyalists, as obstacles to the prosecution not only of the former president but of others they want to hold to account.
If the chief justice is not impeached, then Aquino will have a sworn enemy in the country's highest court.
Meanwhile, largely away from the public gaze, some of Aquino's Cabinet have been cleaning up.
Political trials can be cathartic.
They bring wrongdoers to justice.
But there will certainly be a court that's friendlier to the president.
Like cancer, corruption thrives on a system's vulnerabilities.
In the end, this path will be the more enduring.
