The angel hero, Pit, must set out once again with the help of the goddess of Light, Palutena, to defeat Medusa and end the threat to the human race.
Fortunately, the game comes packed with a nifty stand, because trying to hold and maneuver gameplay was quite the contortion.
On the ground (because apparently this angel has a limit on how much he can fly), Pit navigates through a series of rooms and pathways, defeating enemies and collecting hearts.
If you want more, you bet hearts that you can complete the chapter, winning you more hearts.
If there is a downside to the game, it is the dialogue.
Many times, the dialogue ran on so long that I completed the fight before the characters were done trash-talking each other.
Overall, "Kid Icarus: Uprising" does offer some solid combat, some great visuals and a good soundtrack.
It is rated E 10+ for everyone 10 years old and older due to comic mischief, fantasy violence, and mild suggestive themes.
