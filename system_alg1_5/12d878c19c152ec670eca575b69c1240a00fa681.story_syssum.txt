From 1998 to 2000, I was an assistant dean of students at the University of Virginia.
In reality, it is a farce.
One week.
In most cases I was aware of, male students were not found responsible.
Occasionally suspensions would occur; those were, of course, temporary.
Men who are responsible for rape need expulsion, not just a chance to give an insincere apology to avoid serious consequences.
We also need to remember that ultimately, we don't do a lot of good focusing on just one university.
