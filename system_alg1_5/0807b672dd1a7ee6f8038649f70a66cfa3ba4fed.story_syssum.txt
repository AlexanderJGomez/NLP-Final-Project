(CNN) -- Liangqiao, a small collection of huts and farms in southern China, is known as a cancer village.
Jingjing Zhang, an environmental lawyer who is working the villagers who want to sue the government, said the Dabaoshan mine has been polluting the Hengshui River for decades.
"I always had a dream to live in a place where there's a clean river I can swim in, but this dream seems very difficult to achieve in China now," she said.
China, along with the United States, is a leading emitter of greenhouse gases, which experts say can contribute to global warming.
In 1995, it was $800 million.
Zhang continues to build her case against the mine, trying to win compensation for medical testing, health care and damage to the village's rice crops.
They told her "we already meet all environmental standards," she said.
"He didn't want to go to the hospital because he worried we didn't have enough money to bring up our daughter," she said.
"They have no other choice," Jingjing said.
