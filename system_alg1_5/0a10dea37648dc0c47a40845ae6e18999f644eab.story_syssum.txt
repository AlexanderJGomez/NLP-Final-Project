Good, you're on the jury," he said.

"He called it a 'ground and pound' by Martin, who he said was on top of Zimmerman, beating him."
Shortly afterward, according to West, Zimmerman said Martin "was beating me up, and I shot him."
"What you can really see in these pictures that you will have in evidence are the lumps," West said.
