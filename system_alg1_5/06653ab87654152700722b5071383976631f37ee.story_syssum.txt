Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, a strongman in the troubled Horn of Africa and a key United States ally, has died, his government announced Tuesday.
"He came to power at the barrel of a gun, but he made the transition from rebel leader to political leader very quickly," said Ayo Johnson, a writer on Africa and director of Viewpoint Africa.
And "he was able to address the fundamentals -- health care, education, reducing the poverty rate," Johnson said.
Meles was out of the country when he died and members of his family were with him, according to Bereket.
He did not say what country Meles' body was in or when it would return to Ethiopia, except that it would be soon.
Meles, a key player in talks on the tensions between Sudan and its rival neighbor South Sudan, did not attend.
Meles has been credited with working toward peace and security in the region, and the Ethiopian army sent peacekeepers to battle the Islamic extremist group Al-Shabaab in Somalia.
