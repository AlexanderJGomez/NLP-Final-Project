Earlier, Maduro had said he would expel CNN if it did not "rectify" its coverage of anti-government protests.
There they are.
Maduro called on CNN to rectify its reporting.
Do it.
During the broadcast, Maduro invited a question from Penhaul, who asked about the status of an investigation into the theft of CNN's television equipment at gunpoint this week.
"We expect that you will be able to go with the loss recovered," Maduro said.
If they do not rectify things, get out of Venezuela, CNN, get out," Maduro said, to applause from his pro-government audience.
"They are not going to do that.
"CNN has reported both sides of the tense situation in Venezuela, even with very limited access to government officials," CNN said in a statement, adding that at the time its credentials were revoked, CNN was seeking an interview with the president.
Meanwhile, we will continue reporting on Venezuela in the fair, accurate and balanced manner we are known for."
Lopez, who has denied the charges, is being held in a military prison outside Caracas.
