LONDON, England (CNN)  -- British Airways is asking thousands of its staff to work for free for up to four weeks, spokeswoman Kirsten Millard said Tuesday.
This is by far the biggest crisis the industry has ever faced," said Willie Walsh, British Airways' chief executive.
"It's all well and good for Willie Walsh to say he's prepared to work for free when he earns four times in a month what they do in a year," said Ciaran Naidoo, a spokesman for Unite.
The airline's premium passenger numbers fell 13 percent in the second half of last year, in line with the industry average.
