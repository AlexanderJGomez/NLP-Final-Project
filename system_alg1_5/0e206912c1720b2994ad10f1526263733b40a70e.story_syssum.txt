Flanked by a heavy police presence, the Chinese demonstrators marching past the embassy were vocal but orderly, shouting that the disputed islands belong to China.
But they spurred some of Japan's biggest manufacturers -- Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mazda, Panasonic and Canon -- to halt production at some of their plants in China.
When that treaty was hammered out, "There was one item on which they could not agree, so they agreed to disagree," Tung said.
But Japan's decision "really inflamed public opinion in China," he said.
A total of 11 Chinese government ships were near the islands on Tuesday afternoon, the Japanese Coast Guard said, adding that it had warned the vessels not to enter Japanese territorial waters.
"The U.S. handed over the islands to Japan for its own purpose during the Cold War," Guo Xiangjiang, the deputy director of the China Institute of International Studies, told CNN.
Japan's attempts to portray the purchase as a routine internal real-estate transaction, with the islands passing from one Japanese owner to another, has failed to placate the Chinese authorities.
But by Saturday night, China's state-run media had started appealing for restraint, running commentaries that condemned violence and lectured the public on the expression of patriotism.
