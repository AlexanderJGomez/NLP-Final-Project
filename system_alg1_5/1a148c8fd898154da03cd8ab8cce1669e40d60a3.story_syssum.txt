On July 9 2011, the Republic of South Sudan was born.
Yes, each one of us has fears, hopes and dreams about how we are transforming into a nation.
It was never easy, but I always tried my best and kept complaints out of my heart by holding tightly onto the hope that one day, I would read and write.
My main concern for the newest nation in the world is not tribalism or corruption -- though they both exist, it's the fact that we are still at war with the National Congress (NCP) of Sudan, the governing official party of Sudan, and this needs to be permanently addressed before moving onto smaller issues.
That being said, I am very optimistic about the future of my country.
The solutions we put into place need to be in line with our long-term interests while offering short-term relief, which is not always that easy to do.
All around the world there is corruption, tribalism and division, as many find it easier to pick on those that are different, which is why we need to hold tightly to the good in this world.
