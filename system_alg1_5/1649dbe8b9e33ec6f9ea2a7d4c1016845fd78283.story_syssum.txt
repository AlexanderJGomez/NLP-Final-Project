Far from the media frenzy dominating headlines, from the so-called "ground zero mosque" to a pastor's planned Quran burning, Aman Ali and Bassam Tariq traveled more than 13,000 miles into the heart of America over the last month, visiting 30 mosques in 30 days for Ramadan.
"After 13,000 miles, I think that America still exists, and I'm happy to know that it does," said Tariq, a 23-year-old American of Pakistani descent.
When he approached the fisherman after their car broke down, Tariq says, he didn't know how he'd be received.
"For me, it was like, 'Wow!
"That, to me, is really what this country is about."
Nearby, there's a cemetery marking the pioneering Muslims of America, with birth dates of 1882, 1904, 1931.
Praying in there was like hopping in a time machine," said Ali, a 25-year-old Muslim who was born in Columbus, Ohio.
"They're involved in the community, not just the mosque."
"It's a small but vocal group of Americans in this country pushing this anti-Muslim rhetoric," Ali said.
