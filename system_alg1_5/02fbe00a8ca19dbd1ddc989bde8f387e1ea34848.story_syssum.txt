Since the Pew poll last fall, Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed into law in late March by Republican governor Mike Pence, sparked a nationwide controversy over whether the law allowed wedding-related businesses to refuse service to gay and lesbian couples.
In the CNN/ORC Poll, most Democrats (70%) and independents (60%) say wedding-related businesses should be required to provide services to same-sex couples as they would different-sex couples, while Republicans break broadly the other way, 67% say religious reasons are a valid justification for refusing service.
But among whites who are not evangelicals, 61% say such businesses should be required to provide services to all couples the same way.
The CNN/ORC International poll was conducted by telephone, April 16-19, among a random national sample of 1,018 adult Americans.
