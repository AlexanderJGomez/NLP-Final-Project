Ryanair has complained to OFT about its ongoing row with the UK's Advertising Standards Authority.
Last week, Ryanair complained to OFT about its treatment by the ASA.
The airline said the move was necessary to make technical changes as it converts to a new system, but OFT indicated at the time that the shutdown was due to Ryanair's failure to meet a deadline to list all fares on the site.
Aer Lingus met the new deadline, the OFT said, but Ryanair did not.
