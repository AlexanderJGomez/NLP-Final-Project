In court, Bulger attorney Henry Brennan said the state trooper who complained felt "undermined by one of his superiors, Steve Johnson."
Wyshak said the investigation included "numerous interviews" and that the "allegations were unfounded," calling the accusations "a lot of smoke."
Wyshak said the the internal investigation found complaints against Johnson were "unsubstantiated" and that the "real villain is the state trooper" who he says "went off the deep-end" and denied the allegations when confronted.
The Friday back-and-forth came as the two sides attempt to seat a 18-member jury, including six alternates, in the high-profile case.
But after Bulger fled impending racketeering charges, investigators found he had been an FBI informant whose handler tipped him off about the charges -- a tale that became the inspiration for the Oscar-winning 2006 drama "The Departed."
