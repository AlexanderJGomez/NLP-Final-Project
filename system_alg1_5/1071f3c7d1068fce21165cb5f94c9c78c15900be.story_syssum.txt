Toyota wound up recalling millions of popular vehicles in 2009-10.
Under the agreement, the Justice Department will defer the criminal charge for three years, during which Toyota will submit to government monitoring.
"The disregard Toyota had for the safety of the public is outrageous.
"In the more than four years since these recalls, we have gone back to basics at Toyota to put our customers first," he said.
The recall crisis cost Toyota an estimated $2 billion in repair costs and lost sales, even before it had to pay out any legal settlements.
