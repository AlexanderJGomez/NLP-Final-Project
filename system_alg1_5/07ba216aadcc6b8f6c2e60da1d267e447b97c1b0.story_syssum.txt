Many travelers don't believe there is anything wrong with leaving their personal electronic devices on while in flight, but it's a no-no during takeoffs and landings.
Anyone who flies could tell you how often the rule is ignored, but it's announced before every flight.
There hasn't been any conclusive proof that devices such as tablets and e-readers are a danger, but a study released in 2011 found 75 instances of interference that may have been related to personal electronic devices, However, it is difficult to verify pilots' suspicions because of the difficulty replicating incidents.
"I write to urge the FAA to enable greater use of tablets, e-readers, and other portable electronic devices during flight, consistent with public safety," FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski said in an August letter.
The group will not discuss cell phone use in the air, which is banned by the FCC because of the potential for interference with wireless networks on the ground.
