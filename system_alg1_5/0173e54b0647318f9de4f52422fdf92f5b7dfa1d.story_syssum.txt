Hue is, in many ways, a city of ghosts, of memories and spirits -- and we play on that in Sunday's episode.
Spirit houses, as I understand them, are designed to deal with the problem of hungry, dissatisfied spirits who may not be settled, who have, for one reason or another, unfinished business left behind.
Many, many people were lost, their bodies never identified or recovered.
For this reason, this episode is haunted by ghosts.
It's not.
One filled with passionate, proud cooks, and opinionated, enthusiastic eaters.
