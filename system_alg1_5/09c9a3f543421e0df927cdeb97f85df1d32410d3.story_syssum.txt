Ahmad Shah Massoud, center in white shirt, leads his men in his beloved Afghan mountains.
The man Junger met was Ahmad Shah Massoud, the "Lion of Panjshir."
Massoud had a reputation for integrity and strength, says Junger, who traveled to Afghanistan in 2000 to profile Massoud for his book, "Fire."
"If Massoud would have been in power, he would not sell out."
He was born in Afghanistan's Panjshir Valley, the son of an Afghan army officer.
Shorish-Shamley, the women's rights activist, says Massoud was assassinated just before the 9/11 attacks because bin Laden feared Massoud.
Massoud was appointed defense minister.
"He wasn't as bad as the worst," Fitzgerald says.
When they gained control of Afghanistan, they pushed Massoud's army into the Panjshir Valley.
"He had tranquility about him," says Grad, who journeyed to Afghanistan to talk to Massoud's friends for her book.
A year after Massoud's death, he was named a "National Hero of Afghanistan."
"I want to follow in my father's footsteps," Ahmad said.
