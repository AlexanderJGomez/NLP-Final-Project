Baseball combines sports and statistics, so consider these numbers when assessing the career of Marvin Miller.
In 1984, when Miller left the position, the average players' salary was $329,000.
But Miller persevered and pursued the players' liberation of their capital through free agency in 1975.
Yes, players are now paid sometimes absurd salaries, but fans come to see players, not owners, and they deserve their share of the profits as a result.
Competition works.
The most eloquent tribute to Miller might have been his extended inclusion in the documentary "Baseball" by Ken Burns, one of my favorite movies.
