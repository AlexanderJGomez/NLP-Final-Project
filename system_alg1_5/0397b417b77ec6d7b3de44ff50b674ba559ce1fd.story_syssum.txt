So in 2010, he joined Israel's military.
Flesch, now a graduate student at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, became what's known as a "lone soldier" --  a citizen from another country who joins the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
There's definitely a sense of the need to be in Israel and a need to take part in what's going on," said Mizner, whose organization runs a program called Garin Tzabar, which helps facilitate Americans' entry into the IDF.
Those outside Israel, whether they hold Israeli citizenship or not, can apply for the IDF if they meet requirements including no criminal record, a high school diploma and the ability to speak Hebrew.
Flesch, who is not an Israeli citizen, served more than 18 months.
He became a paratrooper in the Israeli army and was recognized twice as the outstanding soldier of his platoon.
