The government headed by Prime Minister Hazem Beblawi turned in its resignation to President Adly Mansour, state-run Nile TV reported.
Analysts expect army chief Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, who served as defense minister, to run for president.
Mohamed Morsy, the former head of the Muslim Brotherhood's political arm, was elected president in 2012.
But he was ousted in a coup about a year later amid widespread protests against his rule, with opponents accusing him of pursuing an Islamist agenda and excluding other factions from the government.
