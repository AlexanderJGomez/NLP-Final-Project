Jeanne, Amy, Desiree and Nikki were all born into the Tony Alamo Christian Ministry, which, some say, is a cult.
"When Tony would say that God spoke to him, everyone believed it," Jeanne says.
Though no legal documents were ever signed, Jeanne, Amy and Desiree say they were three of Alamo's "wives."
Jeanne, Amy and Desiree say they lived as Alamo's "wives" for years and endured abuse before they were able to leave.
Then, in July 2009, these four young women came face-to-face with Alamo once again.
"Susan Alamo actually operated a television ministry," Lynn says.
Then, in 1982, Susan died of cancer.
"They were completely physically, if not psychologically, as well, exhausted.
Most of them around 10, 11, 12, 13, 14," he said during the interview.
"He was the one who laid down the rules," Desiree says.
"My mom had told me the only person I was going to marry was Tony Alamo," Amy says.
Four days after Alamo exchanged vows with Jeanne, his eighth "wife," she says he made her have sex with him.
But, she says, she still felt that what was happening was wrong.
"I thought, 'If this is heaven and this is what's going to get me to heaven, I'm going to have to go to hell,'" she says.
"He sent every person out to look up and down the highways," Nikki says.
After running for miles through the woods, Nikki was exhausted and terrified.
But Alamo's church, which is still in business, sent a message.
His church and he are open daily to the public, and he is very outspoken, as an open book.
