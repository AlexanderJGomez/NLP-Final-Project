(CNN) -- The electronic component visible in a law enforcement image of an intercepted suspicious shipment from Yemen appears to be a printed circuit board from a disassembled cell phone, an engineer told CNN Friday.
"There is as well a coin type cell (which) is a backup battery, and 2 Board to board connectors.
So this board is very likely to be the main electronic board of a cell phone device."
The D736 is a similar shape to the circuit board.
In the law enforcement photo, the cell phone circuit board is crudely mounted with screws, metal and plastic fragments to what appears to be a stout metal case.
A U.S. official says while the explosive was likely the highly volatile PETN, testing is ongoing.
