But as Coates reminds us, white supremacy was not just about measures of outright racial subjugation; it was also baked into measures intended to create wealth and opportunity, like parts of the New Deal, which contained many devil's bargains with conservative Southern Democrats to exempt African-Americans.
But his article is in some ways mistitled.
He's making a case for a discussion of reparations.

No, Coates doesn't answer these questions.
It's to get us to "why."
But if more of us in reaction to reparations simply say, "I do not know -- but I wish to understand," then we will be making true progress.
