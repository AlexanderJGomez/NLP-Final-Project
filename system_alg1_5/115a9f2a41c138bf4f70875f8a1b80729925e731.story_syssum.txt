"The Bourne Legacy," Universal's $125 million sequel/reboot, which stars Jeremy Renner as a new (but similarly brainwashed) secret agent, topped the chart with an estimated $40.3 million from 3,745 locations.
The R-rated laugher kicked off its run in the same range as Ferrell's last live-action wide release "The Other Guys" ($35.5 million), and Galifianakis' last non-"Hangover" comedy "Due Date" ($32.7 million).
Political tales "Man of the Year" (2006) and "Swing Vote" (2008, an election year), grossed only $37.3 million and $16.3 million, respectively.
After four frames, Christopher Nolan's $250 million Batman finale has soared to $390.1 million, and it will pass "The Hunger Games' " $407.3 million cume to become 2012′s second-highest-grossing domestic performer next weekend.
Sony paid just $15 million to acquire "Hope Springs" from Mandate, who shelled out $29 million to produce the film, and if it proves as leggy as some of Streep's other films — "Julie and Julia" climbed to $94.1 million after a $20 million weekend, and "It's Complicated" earned $122.7 million after a $22.1 million debut -- it will become a profitable mid-level hit for the studios.
Its predecessor, "Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules," had earned $38.2 million at the same point in its run, but that film started with $23.7 million, while "Dog Days" started with just $14.6 million — a difference of $9.1 million.
"The Campaign" -- $27.4 million
"Hope Springs" -- $15.6 million
