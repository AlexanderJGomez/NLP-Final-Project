Many in the party have forgotten an essential element of Ronald Reagan's legacy: his insistence that conservatism had to be packaged as a positive force, as an argument about how to expand the global rights of individuals and make all American families more secure.
On foreign policy, Reagan spoke of a tough anti-communism that would protect the rights of those who lived under Soviet totalitarianism.
Reagan also talked about the quest for abolishing nuclear arms, a cause that he had supported for much of his adult life.
"This administration's objective," Reagan said in his inaugural address, "will be a healthy, vigorous, growing economy that provides equal opportunity for all Americans, with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination.
But at least politically, Reagan understood that Republicans had to appeal to broad segments of the population, or they would lose.
Unfortunately for conservatives, that includes a huge array of Americans, from the elderly to defense contractors to young children in schools.
"Our Republican leaders tell us economic lawsâ€”sacred, inviolable, unchangeableâ€”cause panics which one could prevent," President Franklin D. Roosevelt said in his inaugural address in 1932, "But while they prate of economic laws, men and women are starving.
They are made by human beings."
