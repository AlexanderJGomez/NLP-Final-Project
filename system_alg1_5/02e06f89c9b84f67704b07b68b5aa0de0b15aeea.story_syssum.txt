The leader of the left-wing Syriza party, Alexis Tsipras, was sworn in as Greece's new Prime Minister on Monday after forming a coalition with the right-wing Independent Greeks party.
Declaring victory for Syriza on Sunday after polls showed it winning at least 149 seats in the 300-seat parliament, Tsipras, 40, appeared to brace for a bigger battle.
"So let's go and let's all continue this beautiful and tough fight," he said.
Greece has made remarkable progress in recent years, and we stand ready to continue to assist Greece in addressing the remaining reform challenges," he said.
The austerity imposed by Greece's international creditors has cut deep.
"Our victory is, at the same time, it's a victory for all the people of Europe that are fighting against austerity that's ruining the common European future," he said.
But it's unclear how Syriza's plans to renegotiate the bailout would play out.
