Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said he doubts there would be a doctor that would think three consecutive life sentences "is not a deterrent," but admitted that there might be criticism that Gosnell didn't get death.
"She was a mother, a wife and a grandmother," Smalley said.
Rather, he said, they were already dead as a result of Gosnell administering the drug Digoxin, which can cause abortion.
"There was a lynching by the media prior to the trial," he said.
O'Neill, a medical school graduate, was not charged with performing illegal abortions.
A grand jury report from 2011 says the "people who ran this sham medical practice included no doctors other than Gosnell himself, and not even a single nurse," yet they still made diagnoses, performed procedures and administered drugs.
Gosnell has been accused by authorities of preying on low-income, minority women.
