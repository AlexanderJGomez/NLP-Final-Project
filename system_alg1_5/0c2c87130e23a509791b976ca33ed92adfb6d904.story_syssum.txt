CNN's Ben Wedeman, a veteran Middle East correspondent, puts the incursion into perspective.
So far, Israel hasn't been wildly successful in its stated mission.
What we see is that as Israel's capabilities have changed, so have Hamas'.
This is now a war, in my modest opinion -- it's gone beyond a mere incursion.
In Hamas' opinion, they have achieved one of their objectives, which is to give Israel a bloody nose.
When Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was captured by Hamas in a June 2006 raid near the Israel-Gaza border, it took five years before he was freed, in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners -- so, if true, this will be a huge bargaining chip for Hamas.
The remarks of the White House last week though will not go down well in Israel, I believe.
Washington has tied itself to Israel, and that country's right to self-defense, therefore the U.S. is going to feel some responsibility.
This is why Kerry may be feeling uncomfortable -- he spent almost a year trying to forge a Mideast peace deal, and what's he got to show for it now?
