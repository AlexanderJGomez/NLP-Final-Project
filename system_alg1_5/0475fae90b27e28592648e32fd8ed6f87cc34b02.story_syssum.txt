"Under these circumstances, it's hard to understand how derivative traders at AIG warranted any bonuses, much less $165 million in extra pay.
"It's about our fundamental values," he said.
"All across the country, there are people who are working hard and meeting their responsibilities every single day, without the benefit of government bailouts or multimillion-dollar bonuses.
"I would suggest the first thing that would make me feel a little better toward them [AIG executives] is if they follow the Japanese example and come before the American people and take that deep bow and say, 'I am sorry,' and then either do one of two things: resign or go commit suicide," he said.
"There's no reason why those at AIG shouldn't do the same," he said.
In the House, Democrats are trying to shame AIG executives into forgoing the bonuses.
Complicating the issue, said the committee aide, is that the first infusion of cash to AIG was authorized by the Federal Reserve before Congress passed the $700 billion bailout bill, also known as the Troubled Assets Relief Program, which included some restrictions on executive pay.
The actions of AIG do just the opposite, and every American is justified in their outrage at this breach of public trust," he said.
"Previously, AIG had agreed at our request to make no payments out of its $600 million Financial Products deferred compensation pool," he said.
