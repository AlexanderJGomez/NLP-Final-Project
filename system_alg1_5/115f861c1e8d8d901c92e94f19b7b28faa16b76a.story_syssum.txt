"SiriusXM has terminated its relationship with Anthony Cumia of the 'Opie & Anthony' channel," Patrick Reilly, the satellite radio broadcaster's media relations manager, said in a statement.
Cumia claims he was assaulted by the woman.
When asked why by one person on Twitter, he responded, "Because I can take some punches w/out wasting the cops time."
In 2003, a stunt called "Sex for Sam," which involved people having sex in public places in exchange for prizes, got the pair canceled from New York's WNEW.
