MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A firefighter who was trapped in a fast-moving forest fire in eastern Spain Tuesday and hospitalized with severe burns, died Friday near Barcelona, the Catalan regional government said on its Web site.
On Thursday, a 44-year-old firefighter died while driving a fire truck to fight a forest fire in eastern Teruel province, the regional Aragon government said on its Web site.
Aircraft, including planes and helicopters, were being used to fight the fires in the Aragon region, along with hundreds of firefighters in the hilly terrain, much of it with difficult access.
