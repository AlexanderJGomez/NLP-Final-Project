Then I saw the helicopters, with the bodies on the suspended ropes, and I knew I lost my dad."
Ang Tshiring, 57, was a high altitude cook.
Here, every man, if not in school or too old, is involved in climbing expeditions.
They have few other choices.
"All that matters now are the puja," says Ang Riku, his widow, referring to a series of prayers and rituals.
The Sherpa follow one of the Tibetan sects of Buddhism, Nyingmapa, and believe that 49 days after Ang Tshiring's death, his next life is determined and he may reborn.
Early in the morning, Ang Riku and I plan to go to the three isolated monasteries of Ginupa, Charok and Laudo, located high on the steep hills above Thamo.
"You are my porter," Ang Riku says, bursting into a laugh, and I'm glad that she finds my presence amusing.
We politely decline, but the lama insists and we accept.
We decline, he insists, we accept again.
She cries, holding the hands of the lama, abandoning herself in his support.
Ang Riku also sends bags with salt, butter, rice and money to 500 families in the valley, so they'll recite prayers for Ang Tshiring.
The cost of such devotion is high.
But here in the Thame Valley, there aren't many options.
I offer a puja in the monastery for Ang Tshiring in the afternoon and ask Lopsang, a young monk who says he escaped from Tibet, the reason behind the bad luck.
