Zabiullah Mujahid: The policy is quite clear.
But the mujahadeen were fighting each other, the people were being killed.
And No.
Mujahid: First I want to tell you this is not an election, it is selection.
It is not the will of the Afghan nation.
We will see the place.
Where there is the combat war, we will do it in that place.
Mujahid: We do not want to interfere in the Pakistan Taliban affairs.
So we are Muslims.
Mujahid: I will clearly tell you.
CNN: Some people say President Obama has made Afghanistan a very big part of his foreign policy.
I want to tell you clearly we will win, and they will die.
Mujahid: Our conditions are clear.
Secondly, they will leave the country.
They are not our representatives.
We will announce the people.
We will win.
I will tell you we will win; we have the support of Muslim nations and this is what we believe.
Then we attacked.
Mujahid: We are not under the command of al Qaeda.
Mujahid: We are from this country; we are the boss.
