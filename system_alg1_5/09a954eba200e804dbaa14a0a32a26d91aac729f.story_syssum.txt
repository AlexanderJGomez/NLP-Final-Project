"The youth protesting today are being used by the JMP who are trying to steal the revolution from them," Abdu Ganadi, deputy minister of information for the GCC said Monday.
"The opposition wants everything and President Saleh is still the most powerful person in the country," GCC's Ganadi said.
"The opposition is now the one going against the GCC initiative," said Ganadi.
Last week, Saleh said he welcomes the council's efforts to help resolve the political crisis in his country.
Violence and protest have raged in Yemen, where protesters have called for the ouster of Saleh.
"We will not differ with the revolution youth and we will support them," Yahya Abu Osbaa, a senior JMP official said.
"In the end, I can assure you that we will agree on terms," Osbaa said.
