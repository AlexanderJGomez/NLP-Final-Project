Released this week, the National Sleep Foundation's annual poll estimated that Americans get an average of about 6.7 hours of sleep during a weekday.
Over the last decade, the poll indicates that a growing percentage of Americans is getting less than six hours of sleep and the number of people who get eight or more hours is dwindling.
Stress is associated with sleep deprivation, anxiety, depression and sleeplessness.
"This has been more insidious over two decades," Kakar said.
Centuries ago, people routinely slept eight to nine hours a day, he said.
But now, only about a quarter in the survey reported getting eight or more hours of sleep.
"There has been no decline in sleep.
"I can't believe that people get that much sleep in this busy world of ours," Kavey said.
"I think a lot of people need 8.6 hours of sleep, but I think very few people get it."
"You may actually sleep four hours, but you're in bed for eight hours," said Drake, who is a board member with the National Sleep Foundation.
If a person is working more, he or she borrows that time from sleep.
"Our society has valued people who brag about being able to function on very little sleep as a mark of someone who is aggressive, dynamic, successful," Kavey said.
