An official at St. Elizabeths Hospital, where Hinckley, 56, has lived for decades after being found not guilty by reason of insanity, said Hinckley had been engaged to a former patient he met at the hospital.
According to Jones, another doctor told Hinckley the relationship was ill-advised and eventually Hinckley ended it.
Jones said Hinckley has had some difficulties.
Jones said Hinckley, when in Williamsburg, had not been interested in going to a gym or participating in certain sports like golf or tennis, either because of arthritis or because he finds the activities unappealing.
Murphy was involved in a psychological risk assessment of Hinckley.
In opening arguments Tuesday, prosecutor Sarah Chasson said the court should not allow Hinckley to be released "to protect public safety."

So far, Hinckley has been sitting quietly and has shown no reaction to the testimony.
