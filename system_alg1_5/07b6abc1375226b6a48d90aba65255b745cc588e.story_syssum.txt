The phones will run a modified version of Google's Android software, which is being developed as part of an initiative that spans multiple federal agencies and government contractors, these people said.
"We've had kind of an accelerated approval process," McCarthy said.
As many as 5 million Android users may have had their phones compromised by a recent virus outbreak rooted in apps found on Google's market, said security software maker Symantec.
Rather than building special handsets hardwired with secure components, the government plans to install its software on commercially available phones, the people familiar with the project said.
"There's a lot of interest in Android," Bryan Schromsky, a Verizon director for its wireless data services, said in a phone interview.
Federal officials have met with Apple, but they were told they could not have access to the core of the company's mobile operating system, said Angelos Stavrou, an information-security director at George Mason University who is working on the government project as a contractor, in a phone interview.
"When you download an application on your phone, you don't really know what it does," Stavrou said.
On government phones, officials will be prompted with detailed reports about what data may be sent, and they can decline or allow each transmission, the people involved said.
They are also consulting with several federal agencies, many within the Department of Defense, he said.
"We are very cautious about what we release to the public," Stavrou said.
The Defense Department, which houses the agency, has designated the smartphone project as a priority, he said.
Typically, each agency does its own independent security testing, they said.
"We had to go through many hoops for that to happen," Stavrou said of the plan to open-source the software.
Many companies have expressed interest in the government smartphone project, officials said.
"Voice is the immediate need," Schromsky said.
