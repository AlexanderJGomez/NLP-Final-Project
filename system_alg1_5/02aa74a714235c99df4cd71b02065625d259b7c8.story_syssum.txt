The bullets found her in January of 2010, but again, she survived.
Gorrostieta's body was found last week, her hands bound.
"I will rise up again as many times as God allows me to so that I can keep on seeking, fighting for, and working out plans, projects and actions for the benefit of the people, especially those most in need," Gorrostieta, who was also a medical doctor, said after one of the unsuccessful attacks against her.
Investigators are not ruling out any possible motives -- political, personal or criminal -- in her killing, the state's deputy attorney general, Marco Aguilera, told CNN.
Between them, the couple was targeted a total of four times, and a motive for the attacks was never established, Aguilera said.
