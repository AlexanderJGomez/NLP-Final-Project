Sergio Aguero's second half strike was enough to give Manchester City a closely fought 1-0 victory over a Manchester United side that played the majority of this tense match with ten men after Chris Smalling was sent off late in the first period.
Pellegrini's men have struggled in recent weeks, losing to Newcastle United and West Ham in domestic competitions whilst drawing with CSKA Moscow in the Champions League.
City's recent dominance in this fixture now makes the big spending "noisy neighbors" accusation once leveled by former United manager Alex Ferguson seem a long time ago.
When Smalling was sent off, after picking up a second booking for a lunging tackle on James Milner that Van Gaal later described as "not very smart," it looked like the lively Argentine would find more space against United's depleted back line.
While that didn't exactly turn out to be the case, as United still created more than their fair share of chances, he was to prove the difference just after the hour mark.
Referee Michael Oliver remained unmoved and when the ball broke to Di Maria, the Argentine's shot was brilliantly saved low down to his right by Hart.
