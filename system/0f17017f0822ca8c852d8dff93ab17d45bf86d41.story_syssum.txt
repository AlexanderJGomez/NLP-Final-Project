But despite all that, when Tony Hatch, also a Brit, presented me with a song called "Downtown," I knew I wanted to record it.
And so I was propelled into this amazing and exciting "love in" with America.
I was spending more and more time in the States, working with some of the best American musicians and certainly listening to the great American bands of the day: The Beach Boys, The Mamas and the Papas and more.
They opened the floodgates, and the world became aware of British talent almost overnight.
I seemed to be constantly bouncing around between the United States and Europe and was jet-lagged most of the time!
For me, the buzz was and still is all about the music and being around people who feel the same way.
The British Invasion came and went, but left behind a body of music that lives on today.
