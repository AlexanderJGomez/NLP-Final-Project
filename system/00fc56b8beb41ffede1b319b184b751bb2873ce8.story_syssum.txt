(CNN) -- A Dutch court intervened Friday to stop a 13-year-old girl from attempting to sail around the world by herself, stripping her parents of sole custody.
The court will then make a final ruling on whether her parents may have the final say about their daughter's plans, the court official said.
He said the parents are especially pleased that the court didn't prevent Laura from making the journey, because they hope she can still proceed with her plans.
Just this week, a British teenager became the youngest person to sail around the world solo when he returned to Britain after a nine-month trip.
He said he doesn't think age alone should determine whether Laura Dekker is ready for such an adventure.
Another sailor, Robin Knox-Johnston, also said age shouldn't be the only determining factor.
Gold medal-winning Olympic sailor Shirley Robertson insisted that sailing is an experience-based sport and that Laura may not be ready for such a great challenge.
"Mike had already completed challenges such as sailing across the Atlantic before embarking on his ultimate quest.
