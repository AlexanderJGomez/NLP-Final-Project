"Tonga has just woken up to the sad news of the passing of King George Tupou V," said Paula Ma'u, an official in the Ministry of Information and Communication.
"This king brought in things like mobile phones and other advances that we couldn't dream would come to Tonga, and his push for democracy made a big impact on the people here," Fonua said.
In 2008, he announced he was giving up most of the near-absolute power that his family held for centuries and allowing the prime minister to guide the day-to-day governmental affairs.
The present dynasty was founded in 1845 after the Tongan islands were first united.
