I wouldn't have enough money to do something like that," said Cox-Reed, a film and video student at Columbia College in Chicago.
While many young adults are now covered by the Affordable Care Act, able to remain on their parents' insurance until age 26, the rules are different for those like Cox-Reed, who grew up in the foster care system.
Medicaid coverage will be extended for former foster youth until they reach 26, as long as the individual was in foster care and enrolled in Medicaid until the age of 18.
States will only be required to keep former foster children on Medicaid if they continue to reside in the state where they were in foster care originally.
She, Lehmann and other child advocates wrote a letter, circulated by the Children's Defense Fund, to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services at the Department of Health and Human Services, which is working on the revisions before this part of the ACA is implemented in 2014, asking them to reconsider this limitation.
She needs someone to remove her wisdom teeth, but can't find a single dentist who will take her Medicaid card and she can't afford to pay for it on her own.
Health and Human Services has not responded to the child advocates' letter and did not respond to repeated requests for comment from CNN on the matter.
"States are still trying to figure out how these former foster youth can be identified, how they can let young adults know that this benefit is open to them and how they can enroll," Lehmann said.
