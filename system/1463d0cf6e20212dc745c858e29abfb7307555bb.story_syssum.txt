Virgin chief Richard Branson has put a time frame on his plan to launch tourists into space, claiming he and his family will blaze a trail for hundreds of fare-paying passengers by blasting off in December 2013.
Six hundred are expected to fly in the first two years of service.
Branson acknowledged the existing price tag means that his goal of opening space travel up to ordinary people was some way off.
Virgin Galactic's commercial director Stephen Attenborough told CNN that the goal was to be able to offer a reliable satellite launch system for $10 million, a price tag he says undercuts existing services by up to 50%.
"In America you've got a lot of skeptics about global warming, what you need is the scientific evidence that it is there one way or the other," he said.
"There's one guy who wants to assume a neutral position, close his eyes and get back to the womb.
"I'm sure we will do something but we haven't got that far thinking about it.
Adam Wells, Virgin Galactic's head of design, said the cabin's interior was being kept as minimal as possible to reduce weight and maximize space for floating.
"As we age and we approach the end, we are part of the universe and I think it's wonderful to see it from another angle.
As Virgin Galactic's chief pilot, David Mackay is likely to helm the first flights and may even break records for space travel as he clocks up at least one voyage per week when the service is up and running.
