Umm Khattab, as she identifies herself online, is one of scores of women that have joined the terror group that has declared an independent Islamic state across huge swathes of Iraq and Syria in recent months.
The Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium (TRAC) estimates that as many as 15% of ISIS' foreign recruits are women -- possibly up to 200 women from at least 14 different countries.
She is believed to write a blog under the name Umm Layth that reads as a how-to manual for any female ISIS recruit.
But her ambitions to take on a frontline role appear to have been thwarted by ISIS' strict rules for women.
"We have plenty brothers (sic) who don't even get selected on operations.
There are reports of the women conducting inspections of schools and markets, and flogging women who are not fully veiled in the niqab.
Despites the seemingly trivial exchange of recipes and designs, there is little doubt that these women are staunch advocates of the values and beliefs of ISIS and regularly call on other "sisters" from around the world to make the "hijrah," or journey, to Syria.
