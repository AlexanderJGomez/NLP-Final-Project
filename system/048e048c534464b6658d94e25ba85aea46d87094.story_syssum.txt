"The brothel where I was ... there [were] many customers coming in every day.
The 61-year-old woman and her group, Maiti Nepal, have been fighting for more than 16 years to rescue and rehabilitate thousands of Nepal's sex trafficking victims.
According to the U.S. State Department, some 10,000 to 15,000 women and girls from Nepal are trafficked to India and then sexually exploited each year.
But when her relationship took a violent turn, her life's "purpose and responsibility completely changed," she said.
It was very difficult because I didn't know in those days where to go and report [it], who to ... talk to."
"When the girl first comes to Maiti Nepal, we never, never ask them a question.
Many of the staff are sex trafficking survivors now committed to helping rehabilitate other girls.
While some of the girls are able to return to their families, many of them -- particularly those with HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases -- become socially stigmatized and are no longer welcome in their home communities.
"The hardest part for me is to see a girl dying or coming back with different diseases at an [age] when she should be out frolicking," Koirala said.
Their community awareness camps educate families in rural villages and city slums about the dangers of sex trafficking, and a daily patrol at crossing points along the India-Nepal border successfully rescues an average of four Nepali girls a day.
But Koirala says that among those rescued by Maiti Nepal, there isn't a single case when a girl has returned back to the streets.
Today, she works at Maiti Nepal as a peer educator and also helps with the group's awareness camps.
If Maiti Nepal wasn't there for me, I would be dead by now."
