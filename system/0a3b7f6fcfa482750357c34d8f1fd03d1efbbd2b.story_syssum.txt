The Coast Guard first encountered Baluchi on Wednesday after receiving a report about a man in a bubble off the coast of Miami, disoriented and asking for directions to Bermuda, a Coast Guard press release said.
In the press release, the Coast Guard said Baluchi had protein bars, bottled water, a GPS and a satellite phone.
A Coast Guard HC-130 airplane and MH-60 helicopter, along with the vessel Maersk Montana, were sent to rescue Baluchi 70 nautical miles east of St. Augustine, the Coast Guard said.
The CNN.com story quoted Baluchi saying he'd run across the United States twice and around its perimeter once.
"Reza doesn't listen to anyone," Davis Hyslop, a businessman and one of Baluchi's supporters, said in the 2012 story.
But you gotta be a little crazy to undertake such an endeavor, right?"
