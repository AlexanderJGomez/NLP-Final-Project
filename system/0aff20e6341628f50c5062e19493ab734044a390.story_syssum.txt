(CNN) -- Flooding described by India's prime minister as the worst in recent times, has left at least 95 people dead and almost 2 million others homeless in the country's remote Assam state.
But water levels have begun to recede, and thousands have returned to damaged homes.
The agency reported that flooding had begun as early as June 24 in some areas and affected all of Assam's 27 districts.
"Once we have completed rescue and relief operation, our focus will shift to restoration of the damaged infrastructure," Singh said.
Large swaths of cropland have been affected by the flooding, and a railway line has been severely damaged by landslides.
