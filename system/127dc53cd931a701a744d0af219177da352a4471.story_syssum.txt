A month earlier, ten Saudi women climbed to Mount Everest base camp, headed by Princess Reema Bandar to raise awareness of breast cancer and to promote physical activity.
Since the company was established, an elite team for both girls and boys has been training hard for possible international competition and to lay the foundation for a potential girls national team.
In addition to that, very limited private facilities are available for similar activities, and there are no female members of Saudi Arabia's various sporting federations with the exception of Arwa Mutabagani in the Equestrian Federation.
Public funds need to be allocated, as the private sector alone will not be able to nurture sports women to a level so they can compete against others from countries that have supported women sports for decades.
