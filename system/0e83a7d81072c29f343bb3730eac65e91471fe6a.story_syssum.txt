A leading Italian soccer coach has called for stronger action against racism after a top-level match between AC Milan and Roma was suspended Sunday due to abusive chants by supporters.
It could penalize some people but in the long run it would help us to grow as a nation and become more civilized."
"Mario gave all he had this evening, but he's 22 years old and always subject to these racist boos and that's not good.
Milan's Kevin-Prince Boateng walked off the pitch due to racist abuse during a friendly match against a lower league team in January, being followed by his teammates.
The veteran Ghana international clasped the official's arms and kept them pinned to his side, but was eventually sent from the pitch after Boateng intervened to calm him down.
To miss out on the Champions League, Milan will have to lose next weekend's final match at relegated Siena, while Fiorentina must beat bottom club Pescara -- or win by more than four goals if the Rossoneri draw.
Earlier Sunday, Edinson Cavani took his Serie A-leading goal tally to 28 as second-placed Napoli came from behind to beat Siena 2-1 thanks to Marek Hamsik's injury-time winner.
