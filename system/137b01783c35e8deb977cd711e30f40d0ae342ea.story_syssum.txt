British rider Cavendish, who won six stages last year, had a better day after struggling in the wet and on the cobble stones of previous runs but will be disappointed after being forced out of contention at the final sprint.
Hushovd retained the sprinters' green points jersey that he won overall last year and in 2005, but had his margin trimmed to 10 points by Petacchi and acknowledged the threat posed by the 36-year-old -- back at the Tour for the first time since 2004.
I still have a lead in the green jersey competition but you saw today that I lost a lot of points to Petacchi and McEwen.
He seems really strong now and, if he wants to, he come make it all the way to Paris.
We needed something like this after tough, hard, nervous, and stressful opening stages," he said.
