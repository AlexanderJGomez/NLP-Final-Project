The longest-serving governor in Texas history didn't reveal much about his political future as he announced on Monday that he wouldn't seek re-election.
The best days of his campaign were the first ones, when he quickly topped polls for the Republican nomination.
"He was supposed to be the conservative coming in from Texas, the new Ronald Reagan.
The roster could be stronger if Republican stars like New Jersey Gov.
But if he runs, Perry would presumably enter the race at a much earlier date and wouldn't be fighting high expectations, which were placed on his candidacy from the start last time.
Republican strategist and CNN contributor Kevin Madden also said experience matters.
He said Romney's campaign leadership took Perry seriously since he could raise money and would make a splash entering a fluid competition for the nomination.
If Perry runs again, his first big test with Republican voters would be in Iowa, where the caucuses traditionally kick off the presidential nominating calendar for voters.
"With a wide open GOP nomination contest and an unsettled a GOP electorate, it would be foolish to write off a candidate with Governor Perry's record of economic success," Strawn told CNN.
