Williams -- who was fired by Woods in July -- was being presented with a satirical award Friday night at an awards dinner in Shanghai, China, for comments he made after his new boss, golfer Adam Scott, defeated Woods at the Bridgestone Invitational in Ohio in August.
"I now realize how my comments could be construed as racist," Williams' statement said.
But he said he does not believe Williams is a racist.
Williams said in July he was shocked and disappointed that Woods had severed their 12-year relationship, especially after he remained loyal to the golfer during the sex scandal in which he was embroiled for several months.
"Well, I think when you're great friends with somebody and a situation like this occurs, you obviously lose some kind of respect," Williams said.
