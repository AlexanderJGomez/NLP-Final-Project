The decommissioned warship was scuttled in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary between 10:20 a.m. and 10:30 a.m.
About 300 boats positioned themselves as close as possible to the site, and cheers went up when the Vandenberg slipped beneath the water seven miles south of Key West, the spokesman said.
The commission "estimates that the vessel's life span of at least 100 years will contribute stable, long-term habitat for scores of marine fish species, and provide exceptional diving and fishing opportunities for Florida residents and visitors," its Web site says.
To sink the Vandenberg, holes were made above the waterline in the side of the ship and throughout various decks, Newman said.
In the 1960s the Air Force used the Vandenberg to track missiles.
The Vandenberg was chosen from among 400 decommissioned military vessels mainly based on appearance: "her topside structure, her smooth, interesting hull lines, big girth and her starring role in a motion picture," Newman said.
Four men who had served on the Vandenberg traveled to Key West to see the ship go to its final resting place.
It sank in water about 212 feet deep.
