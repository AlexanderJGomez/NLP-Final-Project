"'Everything is OK, you can get on with your life but they had to amputate your leg.
On Sunday March 2, 2008 he was competing in a World Cup Super-G race -- in Kvitfjell, Norway -- and crashed into a gate, falling down the mountainside, breaking his leg in the process.
The resulting damage to his blood circulation in his leg meant the doctors had to amputate below the left knee -- had they not done so, he could have died.
When I think about it or I'm angry about it, it doesn't matter as the reality is that would not change a thing.
Where once he had aspired to compete in both Vancouver and Sochi alongside able bodied athletes, he will instead take part at the Paralympics in the Russian city, and he has modest ambitions.
"The years have been very tough, so this journey is still the most important.
With a new job with the ski manufacturer Salomon, he felt his life had moved on but gradually his view shifted, and the lure of the slopes returned.
For his first competitive run, he admitted he was awash with nerves, unsure how well he had adapted in training to skiing on a prosthetic leg and of the different technique required to tackle the gates on the course.
"It was the feeling of my last race, like it was a few months ago and not three years ago.
Severe inflammation in previous seasons meant he had to undergo further surgery -- "the pressure on the stump when skiing is so much" -- but he is now on top of the problem, getting the right balance of neither too much nor too little exercise on it.
If not, you can't do the sport at the highest level."
Should Lanzinger, named Austria's disabled athlete of the year in 2012, win gold in Sochi, that will only help the cause.
A gold around his neck would surely be the perfect outcome to an often long and tortuous journey.
