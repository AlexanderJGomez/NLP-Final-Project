Greg Bernal of Florissant, Missouri, and girlfriend Janet Momphard of St. Charles, Missouri, on Tuesday hauled what is believed to be a world record catfish into their boat while fishing on the Missouri River.
Bernal, 47, said he was about to call it a day when he decided to give it one last shot.
Before the catfish was put on the scale, Momphard said it had to at least weigh more than 120 pounds, because it weighed more than the generator Bernal kept in the back of his truck.
"Back in 1995, I caught the Illinois state record catfish -- a blue that weighed 79.12 pounds," said Bernal.
"I'd like to see if one of the stores is interested in making a replication of it, like Bass Pro Shops or Cabela's," said Bernal.
"I've been fishing for the monster my whole life ... by chance, he came by to my hook and I actually got him.
