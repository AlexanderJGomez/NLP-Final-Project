(CNN)Shortly after the 10th anniversary of the Iraq War, paralyzed veteran Tomas Young spoke with me about why he intended to end his life.
He said he seldom left his bed and that he popped a dizzying assortment of more than 30 different pills every day.
He said he wanted to spend more time with his wife, Claudia Cuellar.
The cause of death was not immediately clear, according to media reports.
Young had moved with his wife to Portland, Oregon, where, as he stated in his Twitter profile, he was a "happily married man who's happy to live in a medical maryjane state."
Appropriate, I thought, for as controversial as Young had been, I believed he remained true to his convictions.
In a video posted on YouTube Tuesday, Young's sister-in-law, Amanda Young, captured his 34 years of life -- from a baby who put a gleam in his mother's eye to a companion for his brother Nathan; from a young man who felt compelled to serve his nation after the terror attacks of 9/11 to a wounded veteran who became a poster child for those who opposed the U.S. role in Iraq.
Young was a self-avowed atheist, but somehow I could feel him smiling down at his friends, glad that they were remembering him as a nice guy.
