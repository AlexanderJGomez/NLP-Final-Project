As tragic and violent as the circumstances of their injuries were, the 14 people who lost arms, legs, hands or feet as a result of the attack represent a fraction of who undergo amputation in the United States on any given day -- roughly 500 people, according to figures from the Amputee Coalition, the nation's largest limb loss advocacy and support group.
