Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama will use Tuesday's State of the Union address to frame the message of his re-election campaign.
The president will continue to challenge Congress over the ongoing gridlock that blocked most elements of his jobs bill and embroiled Washington in a debt fight last summer.
The speech will build on a theme the president laid out in Kansas last month -- that in today's economy, the game has been rigged against the nation's middle class.
The address will include new proposals to prepare American workers and students for the jobs of the future.
Throughout his speech, the president will weave in an emphasis on what his administration calls middle-class values, and that this is make-or-break moment for that segment of American society, likely putting it into stark terms, according to the sources.
Democratic sources told CNN the draft version of the speech will also propose a task force to monitor and enforce trade rules with China, tough language on Iran and seek to put the president's foreign policy actions and vision in context.
