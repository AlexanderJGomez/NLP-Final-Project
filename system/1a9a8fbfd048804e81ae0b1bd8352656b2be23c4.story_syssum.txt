With 56 million passengers passing through last year, it's the third busiest airport in Europe and claims to serve more international destinations than any other airport in the world.
It can take up to 50 people to handle the turnaround of an A380 and the double-deck plane presents considerable challenges for the airport's staff.
International chefs work around the clock to dish out an average of 100,000 meals a day -- enough to feed the population of a small city.
Maik Herodek, section manager of LSG Skychefs, a catering company at Frankfurt Airport, says its hard to create plane food that isn't plain.
"We check the temperature, we check the freshness, we check everything because it must be the freshest you get, because on the airplane, you can't say 'oh sorry, tell the chef I want another one.'
