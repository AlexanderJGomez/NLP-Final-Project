(CNN) -- Back when I was a kid, they were called "whistle-blowers": employees of corrupt companies or government agencies, who went to the press with shocking stories of criminality or abuse.
Somehow, the recent spate of similarly public defections of employees from the corporations they work for just doesn't feel like quite the same thing.
He says that when he first went to Google, it was "a technology company that empowered its employees to innovate."
He thinks it is a better long-term strategy for Goldman to help its clients make smart investments, rather than convincing them to make bad investments -- and then bet against those very same clients.
They become dissidents not by challenging corporate power, but by challenging their own corporation's methodology -- as if they would have been better CEOs themselves.
The minute Google went public, its only priority was to serve its shareholders.
They are operating on a fiscal landscape where innovation is no longer valued, and where it's easier to make money the old-fashioned way (exploiting people dumber than you are).
It's too little and too late for a few corporate whistle-blowers to tell us how the companies they work for are technically incompetent, distracted by revenues or losing the values that once made them great.
