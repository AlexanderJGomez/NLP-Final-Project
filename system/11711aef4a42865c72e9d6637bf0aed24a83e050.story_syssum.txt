But if you have a regular day job, you'll be commuting home in the dark instead of in daylight come the following day.
Daylight Saving Time has been around for a good part of 20th century, but there's no really good reason why we should continue with the status quo.
Numerous polls show that people want to stay in Daylight Saving Time year round, or at least just stick with either Standard or Daylight time and stop switching clocks around.

A recent study shows the switching of clocks in the spring causes a 25% jump in heart attacks in the few days following the switch, confirming earlier research that point out the shift in time can disrupt the quality of sleep and biological rhythms.
Last year, a member of the Missouri legislature proposed moving the state to permanent Daylight Saving Time if 19 other states would join its effort.
We need help from students, who can create interdisciplinary projects combining science, math, social studies and government, to show why we need to get rid of this outdated concept.
In short, it's about time.
