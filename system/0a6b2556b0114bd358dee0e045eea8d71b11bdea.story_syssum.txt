But after their smoke-filled plane rattled to an emergency landing, passengers had a new lease on life, as they exited a JetBlue flight Thursday via inflatable chutes.
Flight 1416 had left Long Beach Airport about 15 minutes before and was over the ocean, carrying 147 passengers and crew headed for Austin, Texas.
"Our right engine exploded and our cabin filled with smoke," he posted to Twitter.
As it cruised back over land, the plane began to quake, and passengers broke into tears, afraid for their lives.
"I recited the Lord's Prayer as I held my son and my wife in my arms," he posted to social media site whosay.
But the pilot brought the scare to an end by setting the plane, which FlightAware.com identified as an Airbus A320, gently onto the runway.
Passenger Jonathan Hubbard was sitting in the exit row and wasted no time.
"I grabbed my son and jumped down the inflated ramp, my wife following," Rathbone tweeted.
But on the day of the incident, the airline announced CEO Dave Barger would step down, effective in February.
Rathbone and his family went home to celebrate their living through Thursday's scare with a wine and champagne tasting, he said on whosay -- they opened a half-dozen bottles.
