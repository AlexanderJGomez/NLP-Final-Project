The 36-year-old juror, who used only her first name of Maddy out of concerns for her safety, told ABC on Thursday that she and others on the panel felt Zimmerman was guilty, but that wasn't enough.
But she realized on the second day of deliberations that there wasn't enough proof to convict him of murder or the lesser charge of manslaughter.
"We do ask jurors not to reach their verdicts based on what their hearts tell them; for the verdict, a juror must set aside emotions and follow the law," said O'Mara.
Maddy is the second juror to speak about the high-profile case since the all-female jury acquitted Zimmerman earlier this month.
Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, had a confrontation with the unarmed African-American teen after calling police to report a suspicious person, and he said he shot Martin in self-defense.
