I lived with the fear of being detained, abducted or assassinated by the North Korean government for many years.
This rare and surprise interview was an apparent move by the regime to get a high-ranking U.S. official to visit the country.
After I watched the interviews with the three Americans, it was clear that it was a coordinated message to ask for a high-level U.S. envoy to be sent.
Many North Korean refugees we sheltered in China told us how brutal the regime can be.
It seems the three men are being treated well, although it is hard to say definitively.
North Korea has enjoyed near complete control of the media its people consume in the past, but this is rapidly changing.
What the regime does not take into account is that, however it spins a visit by a high-level U.S. dignitary, there are diminishing returns to this familiar cycle.
In the world, it has neither.
