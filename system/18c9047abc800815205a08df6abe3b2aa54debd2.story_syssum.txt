Suleman -- known in tabloids as "Octomom" -- has not been arrested, but she has been ordered to appear before a Los Angeles County judge for her initial arraignment Friday, according to the district attorney's office.
Suleman, 38, performed in adult videos and danced topless at a Florida strip club last year.
Suleman, who collected food stamps to feed her 14 young children, filed for bankruptcy in May, but the case was tossed out of court because of paperwork issues.
She ultimately hopes to become a role model for other women facing major struggles, she said.
Suleman faces up to five years, eight months in prison if convicted, the prosecutor said.
