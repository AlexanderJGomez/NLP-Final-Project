(CNN) -- Don Pardo, the announcer whose velvety baritone voice introduced "Saturday Night Live" hosts on NBC for decades, has died at age 96, the network announced.
He began his career in theater in his native New England, but switched to announcing after being offered a job by a Providence, Rhode Island, radio station.
He became a familiar voice to generations of radio listeners and, later, TV watchers.
"Very sad to hear of the passing of my old friend Don Pardo - truly one the all-time greats," tweeted Yankovic..
Though he was on staff at NBC, he seemed an odd choice for the show, his seemingly strait-laced bearing contrasting with the wild antics of what was, originally, the most iconoclastic comedy show on network TV.
Pardo also appeared in the movie "Radio Days" and on an episode of "30 Rock," among other credits.
