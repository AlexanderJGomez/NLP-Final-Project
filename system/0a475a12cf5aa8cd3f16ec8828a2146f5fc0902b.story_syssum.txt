While the total cost will depend on the intensity and length of operation, past experience can give some guidance, Malcolm Chalmers, research director from the Royal United Services Institute said.
Cameron named  the Brimstone precision missile, which he said minimized risk of civilian casualties, as one only Britain could contribute.
The missiles can target convoys as well as fast moving, fleeting targets that were previously harder to strike, according to IHS Jane's senior weapons analyst Ben Goodlad.
The aircraft were used by British troops for relief missions in northern Iraq just over a month ago.
These can be used to target areas that can't be accessed by planes, for example due to defenses, and cost round $1.5 million each.
