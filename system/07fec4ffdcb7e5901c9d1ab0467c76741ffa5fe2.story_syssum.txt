The gels, AndroGel and Testim, are approved for use in men who produce little or no testosterone.
Some women use testosterone gel products off-label, perhaps to increase sex drive, but the FDA has not approved these products for any reason in women.
Although most children's signs and symptoms regressed after they were no longer exposed to the gel, in a few cases the enlarged genitalia did not return to normal, and the bone age was still higher than the child's chronological age, the FDA said.
When product users applied gel to body parts that were not indicated in the product's labeling, they "increased the opportunity for a child to be inadvertently exposed," she said.
• Wash the site where the gel was applied with soap and water before coming into skin contact with another person.
• Note that the use of non-FDA-approved testosterone gels that can result the same effects should be avoided.
