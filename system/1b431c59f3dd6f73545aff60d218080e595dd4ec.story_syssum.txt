Aaron Sofer was reported missing on Friday by a friend who he was hiking with in the Jerusalem Forest, Israeli Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told CNN.
The friend "lost contact" with Sofer while walking with him and reported the disappearance to the police, Rosenfeld said.
"I actually was over there today on site," he told CNN's Jake Tapper.
Sofer's disappearance comes two months after what Israeli authorities have called the revenge killing of Palestinian teen Mohammed Abu Khedair, 16.
Prosecutors allege the killing was retaliation for the deaths of three Israeli teens whose bodies were found in the West Bank in June.
