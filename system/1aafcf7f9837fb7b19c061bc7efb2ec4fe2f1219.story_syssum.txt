Some of the collapse is due to the consumer changeover to Apple and Google Android products, but the company -- once known as Research In Motion -- hasn't helped itself with poor planning and delayed product introductions.
Ronen Halevy, an IT security professional who runs the site BerryReview.com, still prefers his BlackBerry because it "focuses on communications first" -- even though he's familiar with both Android and iPhone platforms.
"They're very good devices to consume information, but the main point of the phone is that it's more like a computer," he says of the Apple and Google phones.
He suspected that becoming a corporate-focused software business might be the company's best way out of the wilderness -- even if it means leaving the consumer market behind.
All it is guaranteed to change is the ownership structure," he said via e-mail.
The NEC Terrain, another Android phone with a physical keyboard, is marketed for its "rugged innovation" but, says Halevy, he doesn't think it's really aimed at the general consumer.
All have their pros and cons, whether it's your comfort with their operating systems or your desire for certain accessories.
"An iPhone would feel like a step backwards on those things which matter to me."
