Over the last two decades, the sector's products have accounted for more than 90% of the country's merchandise exports by value, supplying international markets with items such as canned tuna, also known as the Seychelles' "blue gold."
As part of this increased security drive, the Seychelles coast guard has intensified its patrolling efforts, with fast-attack armed vessels monitoring a newly defined zone for fishing.
Analysts say that fishing boats are of particular importance to pirates because they can be used as floating bases from which to launch further attacks.
But while the measure seems to be working -- there have been no successful attacks in nearly a year -- the restrictions on the movement of Seychellois fishermen has created another problem.
Joram Madnack is the general manager of the French-owned Indian Ocean Tuna, one of the world's largest tuna canneries and the biggest employer in the Seychelles.
"We now fish where we are allowed to fish," says Peter Sinon, the country's minister of natural resources and industry.
And although many of the pirates have now gone, the fishermen say their industry still hasn't recovered.
"We could go anywhere we wanted without the fear of piracy and everything."
