But Louis Schlamowitz, for one, is grateful to postmen, who over the years have dropped thousands of envelopes into the mailbox of his cramped apartment in the Canarsie neighborhood of Brooklyn, where he has spent all his life.
Among the likes of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Yasser Arafat and Hosni Mubarak is Moammar Gadhafi, whose ignoble death last month earned Schlamowitz himself a bit of instant fame.
Schlamowitz's collection -- he says he has more than 6,000 letters and autographed photos -- had been written about before, but after Gadhafi died, everyone became curious about why an 81-year-old American corresponded with the despot.
A month and a half later, came the response, on presidential stationery.
Back in New York, he married, had a daughter, and worked for 35 years designing floral arrangements first at a Manhattan shop, then closer to home in Brooklyn.
"I found his name in the papers," Schlamowitz says, sitting at a cluttered table surrounded by metal folding chairs.
Gadhafi wrote several times more; one letter attacked America for practicing terrorism with its support of Israel -- not what a Jewish man who also had letters from Israel's Golda Meir, Yitzhak Rabin and Moshe Dayan would want to read.
After the Libyan uprising was well under way, Schlamowitz felt an urge to write again.
If Schlamowitz's correspondence has intrigued the public, it has certainly raised eyebrows in the halls of intelligence.
That he just wanted to write to them and maybe get a photo to hang on his otherwise drab walls.
Two letters from Marilyn Monroe fetched $500.
The problem was the advance was a personal check.
Schlamowitz has no idea what his collection is worth, but he knew when he was getting ripped off.
He doesn't know why reporters called on him so much, though he certainly enjoys showing off his stuff.
"I just want to be a part of history."
