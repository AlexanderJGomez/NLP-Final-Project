"The cities surrounding the proposed site are home to 170 different eating cultures -- from Moroccan to Indonesian, from Turkish to Chinese -- and we're aiming to grow food to satisfy all their tastes," said Jago van Bergen, an award-winning architect and one of the brains behind the "Park Supermarket" -- which has been shortlisted for the upcoming World Architecture Awards in November.
"The plan is to divide the park into three climate zones -- moderate, Mediterranean and tropical.
"To make up this difference we'll use a combination of traditional and modern farming methods that all work by trapping and storing heat and releasing it when temperatures drop,"
If successful, the firm believes this type of system could form part of a new approach to sustainable farming, making use of urban greenbelts while helping to reduce the carbon footprint associated with food production -- which accounts for up to 30% of total emissions worldwide, according to a 2008 Greenpeace report.
"Because all the food in our supermarket will be grown on site we won't need a big processing factory to make packaging and we won't have to burn lots of fossil fuel to transport it across the globe," he said.
"Anything that reduces food miles and other carbon emissions linked to food production is normally a positive thing," said Dr Nicola Canon, lecturer in crop sciences at the UK's Royal Agricultural College.
I think creating tropical climates next to moderate ones could introduce a host of new diseases and pests to the region in quite an unpredictable way," she warned.
For van Bergen, this type of criticism misses the point, because he sees the Park Supermarket as just one of many possible alternatives to the existing system of food production.
