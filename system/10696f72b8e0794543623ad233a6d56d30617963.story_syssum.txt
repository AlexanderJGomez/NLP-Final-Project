(CNN) -- A call to the Secret Witness tip line helped police break CNN's first featured cold case: the slaying of college student Brianna Denison, investigators say.
The arrest of James Michael Biela, 27, closes one chapter and opens another as the case moves from the investigative phase and into the courts.
Denison, who attended Santa Barbara Community College, vanished January 20 while visiting friends at the University of Nevada's Reno campus.
Biela also was charged with first-degree kidnapping and sexual assault of a second young woman, a student at the University of Nevada, Reno.
Police said at the news conference that they found DNA matching Biela's on the rear door of  the off-campus house where Denison was staying with friends.
One of the previous victims was able to describe Biela's pickup, another key link in the evidentiary chain, according to investigators.
Investigators had established that the killer was from the Reno area and had an unusual fetish of collecting one victim's underwear and leaving it as a "calling card" at the next victim's crime scene.
An overnight session at the crime lab confirmed the match, and charges were filed, police said.
When first questioned about the Denison case in early November, Biela refused to submit DNA samples and provided an alibi to police, claiming that he'd been with his girlfriend.
"We knew the profile we were looking for: someone unobtrusive, who stalked his victims quietly but escalated his violence with each new attack," he said.
