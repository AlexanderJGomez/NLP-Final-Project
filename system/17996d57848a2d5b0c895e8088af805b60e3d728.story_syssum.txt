(CNN)  -- Caroline Wozniacki moved a win nearer to reclaiming the world number one spot from Kim Clijsters but her passage to the last 16 in Dubai only came after her Russian opponent, Anna Chakvetadze, fainted on court.
Morita beat Clijsters' Paris final conqueror Petra Kvitova in the first round and followed that up Wednesday with a straight sets win over Sania Mirza, the Indian star now based in Dubai.
"I think every single person who knows me watch that match in Melbourne came to me and said it was a great match," Kuznetsova said.
Murray, beaten in the final of the Australian Open by Novak Djokovic, played last week in Rotterdam, but was well below his best and won only five games in losing his first-round clash to Marcos Baghdatis.
