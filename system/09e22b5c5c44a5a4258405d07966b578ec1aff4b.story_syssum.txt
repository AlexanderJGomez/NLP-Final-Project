(CNN) -- The woman who scrambled to safety after a small plane crashed into her Florida home gave thanks to God on Saturday for allowing her to escape without a scratch and for keeping her family safe.
"From what we've been told, the pilot was having some malfunctions in flight," said Chief Investigator Terry Duprie of the National Transportation Safety Board.
Investigators will try to figure out why the plane made such a steep descent into the home and whether the weather conditions -- light rain and low clouds -- played any role, he said.
Her college-age daughter, Jessica, who was home for the holidays, would have been lounging on a bed that's now "charred and mangled" if she hadn't decided to head back to school a few days early, Crockett said.
Crockett's grandson often comes over to her house, where "he stands in front of the television that's now a big glob of metal," but his dad decided to take him to day care Friday, she said.
