Paraguay's President on Saturday named a new interior minister and national police chief following clashes between police and peasants that left at least 17 dead.
About 300 law enforcement officers arrived Friday morning to serve the order when some of the approximately 100 farmers who had been occupying the land illegally for more than a month began shooting at them, authorities said.
Rodriguez lamented the loss of life, but said the peasant leaders did not order the attack on police.
In a special session, the House of Representatives observed a minute of silence in honor of the dead, the Agency of Public Information reported.
