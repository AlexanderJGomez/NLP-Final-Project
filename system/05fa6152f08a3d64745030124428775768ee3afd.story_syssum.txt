Mills represented herself during the proceedings and was a "less than impressive witness" on her own behalf, Judge Hugh Bennett wrote in awarding her £24.3 million ($48.6 million) -- far less than the £125 million she had sought from McCartney in the dissolution of their four-year marriage.
A summary of Bennett's decision was released Monday, but Mills had sought to keep the full ruling under wraps.
Mills opposed the full ruling's publication because it contained private details about her and her 4-year-old daughter with McCartney, Beatrice.
"He expressed himself moderately though at times with justifiable irritation, if not anger," the judge wrote in a glimpse of the emotions aired behind closed doors.
Bennett found Mills failed to produce financial records to back up statements about money she claimed to have in the bank before marriage, which she said amounted to more than £2 million.
"She is a kindly person and is devoted to her charitable causes," the judge wrote.
"The wife's evidence that in some way she was the husband's 'psychologist,' even allowing for hyperbole, is typical of her make-belief," the judge wrote.
Mills and McCartney failed to agree on a divorce settlement in six days of hearings in February, leaving the judge to decide the terms.
