While the Broward County Sheriff's Office continues to piece together a time line, detectives believe Maldonado shot and killed his 47-year-old wife, Monica Narvaez-Maldonado, and their 17-year-old son, Pedro Maldonado Jr., with a crossbow in their Weston townhouse sometime on Monday.
JosÃ© Maldonado never reported the attack to police, but it was his father's confession to a friend on Tuesday that set authorities on his trail.
Later in the day, authorities learned that Maldonado might be in the Lake City area, about 100 miles east of Tallahassee.
I don't see why parents have to get the kids involved.
