Last Monday, Vice Premier Li delivered the keynote speech at the Boao Forum, a meeting of business and political leaders held yearly in southern Hainan province.
As the current executive vice premier, Li already oversees important portfolios, such macro economic planning, health care, energy and housing.
When he visited Hong Kong University last year, he delivered part of his speech in English -- a gesture that prompted debate in the mainland.
Li is considered a carbon copy of President Hu Jintao, his mentor and benefactor, because of similarities in background, priorities and style.
"He had the social experience from the Cultural Revolution, so he was also pragmatic."
Li did not stand for elections -- he happened to have an off-campus internship -- but as chairman of the student federation he spent time with politically active students like Wang Juntao, who campaigned but failed to get a seat.
"In the 1980s, as the CYL cadre in charge of student movement he handled several incidents, still in the old style like his college days -- control the scale of protests but never resort to political prosecution."
Li rose through the ranks of CYL while completing a master's degree in law and then an economics doctorate under Li Yining, the guru of market reforms in China.
Most of the infections actually happened before Li arrived in Henan, but critics accused him of tolerating the cover-up of the scandal.
He acknowledged official corruption as the biggest source of public anger and thought the effective solution was to create transparent rules and adequate supervision.
Chinese microblogger "Yudafengxue" tweeted: "Li is a better speaker than many Chinese top leaders but still needs to work on his stage presentation and body language.
