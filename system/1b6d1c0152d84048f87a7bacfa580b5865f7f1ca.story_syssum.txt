The clinic is consistently among the country's best in quality ratings, and its costs are among the lowest -- which is why President Obama often cites the Cleveland Clinic as an example of how health care in America should be, and why Nissen and other leading doctors here are frequently consulted by lawmakers and administration officials pushing major reforms this year.
The traditional model is for the nonsurgeons and surgeons to be organized in separate groups --- imagine a Department of Medicine and a Department of Surgery.
"Everyone wants to do their procedure," is how Nissen explains the most frequent result.
"And so I'm not incentivized to do more than what is necessary to help the patient.
"Seventy percent of the cost in health care is from chronic disease," Cosgrove told us in an interview at his Cleveland Clinic office.
Cosgrove, like Nissen, is an enthusiastic proponent of major national health care reforms that bring coverage to the estimated 45 to 50 million Americans who lack health insurance and that put an emphasis on primary and preventive care.
Paying for reforms is a dicey political proposition, and mindful of campaign promises not to add to the tax burden on middle class families, Obama has insisted that a major chunk of the money needed to pay for reforms can be found in "cost savings" in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
"The first thing that you will begin to see happening is a deferment in investment in infrastructure.
"The concern right now is 50 percent of the hospitals in the United States are running in the red," he said.
In another cautionary note, Cosgrove, however, said over time he believes widespread electronic record keeping -- and sharing -- will lead to fewer duplicative tests and other cost savings, but that the jury is still out on that question.
"What we haven't seen is our costs come down.
