Gaza City (CNN) -- With the latest failed cease-fire quickly becoming a distant memory, the two sides in the Israel-Gaza conflict traded rockets and airstrikes Saturday -- as well as blame for not stopping the bloodshed.
Israel's military confirmed the strike, saying the two men were militants.
The Israelis and Palestinians -- particularly Hamas, the Islamic militant group and political party that controls Gaza -- have been at it for weeks, with the former fending off persistent rocket attacks and the latter dealing with relentless Israeli strikes.
Still, while there weren't scores of dead Saturday as has been true many other days over the past few weeks, the total carnage remains significant.
The Iron Dome missile defense system has intercepted many of the rockets Gazan militants have fired at populated areas of the country.
Yet militants from Islamic Jihad and the Al-Nasser Salah al-Din Brigades admitted to doing just that -- blaming Israel for refusing to accept their demands during negotiations.
One sad irony of all this bloodshed is that -- according to the Egyptian foreign ministry, which brokered recent talks -- the parties have reached an agreement on most issues.
Palestinians also wanted Israel to extend Gaza's fishing zone in the Mediterranean from three miles off the coast to 20.
Yet Israel is resisting in-depth talks as long as rockets continue to head toward its territory.
