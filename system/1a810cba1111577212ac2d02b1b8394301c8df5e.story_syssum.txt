Marshals Service, the number of threats against federal judges and prosecutors has mushroomed from 500 in 2003 to 1,278 in 2008.
There are no statistics on the number of threats against state and local judges.
Marshals Service, which is responsible for the protection of federal judges, installed an elaborate camera surveillance system at Walton's house.

Investigation often reveals that they have made previous threats against judges in state and local courts.
"The federal court is their final forum, the last resort in their minds to get justice."
In Louisiana judges are the only ones allowed to carry guns in the courtroom, but White doesn't want to discuss whether she does.
But Walton has his own theory on why the volume of threats has increased.
"The type of vicious attacks sometimes that you see coming from certain players in the media, I think contributes to the problem."
