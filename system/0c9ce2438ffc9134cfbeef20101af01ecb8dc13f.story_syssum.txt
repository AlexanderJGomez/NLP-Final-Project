Robel Phillipos, a friend of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's, was convicted Tuesday on two counts of lying to federal agents investigating the 2013 bombing, according to the U.S. attorney's office.
But this case also reminds us that our public safety network relies on every citizen in the commonwealth."
Defense lawyers argued that Phillipos, a Boston native, was a "frightened and confused 19-year-old" when authorities questioned him several times in the days following the April 15, 2013, bombing, which killed three people and wounded more than 260.
Police believe Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev -- who was killed by police after the attacks -- set off the two bombs near the race's finish line.
His attorneys said that Phillipos was under tremendous pressure when he was interrogated and didn't have a lawyer at the time to help him.
Prosecutors said Phillipos repeatedly lied to investigators when he denied that he entered Tsarnaev's dormitory room and saw Kadyrbayev remove a backpack containing fireworks on the evening of April 18, 2013.
Later that night while Tazhayakov and Phillipos watched the manhunt for the Tsarnaevs on television, Kadyrbayev discussed getting rid of the backpack with the fireworks with them.
Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov are both nationals of Kazakhstan who were temporarily living in the United States on student visas while attending the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth.
