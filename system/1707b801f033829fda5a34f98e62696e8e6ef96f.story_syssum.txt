Pedro Zapeta was "very, very happy" when he learned about a federal appeals court ruling that says he is entitled to recover some of the money, said attorney Robert Gershman, who handled the financial end of Zapeta's case.
The appeals court ordered a hearing to set a new fine.
Zapeta had paid taxes on the earnings, he said, and under legal guidelines should be fined at most $5,000 for failing to report that he was traveling with the cash.
"The government always acted as if the money was their own," Gershman said.
He returned to Guatemala this year under the threat of deportation, but his lawyers continued to argue that his fine was excessive.
