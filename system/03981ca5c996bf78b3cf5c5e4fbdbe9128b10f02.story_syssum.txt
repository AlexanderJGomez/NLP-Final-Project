Kevin Lunsmann was reunited with his mother, the U.S. Embassy in Manila said Monday, without offering additional details.
"In this holiday season nothing makes me happier than knowing that an innocent victim is returned to his family in time for holiday celebrations," Harry Thomas, the U.S. ambassador to the Philippines, said in a weekend statement.
"If ever we are to be inspired by the human spirit, we should take comfort in the courage, commitment and love that the Lunsmann family exhibited during this trying ordeal," Thomas added.
Abu Sayyaf has been blamed for several terrorist attacks in the Philippines, including the bombing of a ferry in 2004 that left about 130 people dead, as well as past kidnappings.
Kevin's father told WSET that the boy will eventually share his story of escape, but did not say when.
"I can tell you a lot of things, but I only know that he is a hero," he said.
