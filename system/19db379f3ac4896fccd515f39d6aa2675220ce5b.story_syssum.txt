Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Amy Windom says a "MacGyver" moment helped alert authorities after a terrifying incident Tuesday.
"I dragged my laptop over and with my feet I pried it open," she said.
Six minutes after Windom's boyfriend called 911, officers arrived and discovered Windom still tied to her bed, suffering a cut she sustained when the man struck her with his gun, according to Carlos Campos, a spokesman for the Atlanta Police Department.
Campos told CNN that there is no evidence to believe Windom's story is a hoax, although all elements of the incident are under investigation.
