WASHINGTON (CNN) -- There's not much to cheer inside the once venerable Secret Service lately, but veterans are thrilled that at this moment of crisis that "Father Joe" agreed to take the helm.
Even though PPD agents have little to do with guest clearance at events, when the crisis exploded, Clancy offered to resign.
There was some talk of Clancy coming back when Sullivan left and before Julia Pierson was appointed, for either the number one or number two job, but he preferred to stay in the private sector at the time.
But now that Pierson is gone, agency veterans are thrilled Clancy agreed to come back.
