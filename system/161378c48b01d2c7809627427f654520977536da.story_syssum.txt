For more than 25 years, Oh has lived with the guilt of knowing his wife and two daughters are being held against their will in North Korea because of a choice he made.
Oh, a native of South Korea, moved his family to Pyongyang in 1985 despite his wife's reservations on the promise of a good job and free medical treatment for his wife's hepatitis, but when they arrived he realized he had been tricked.
Oh learned his wife and daughters, only aged 6 and 9 when they first moved to North Korea, were sent to a concentration camp as punishment for his defection.
Oh and the human rights workers believe they were recorded by North Korean officials as a trap to lure him back.
It's been a while since I said the word father and my tears are falling."
Pyongyang claims Oh's wife has already died from her hepatitis and his daughters want nothing to do with him as they say he deserted them.
Sweden has an embassy in Pyongyang and has, in the past, acted as a neutral broker for countries with no presence there.
"I'm more than 70 years old now and exhausted but I will stay alive until I can hold my two daughters again."
