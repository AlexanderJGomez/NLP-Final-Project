The announcement that Russia's prime minister, Vladimir Putin, will run for president in next March's election and will, if elected, appoint the current president, Dmitri Medvedev, as his prime minister brings to mind one of the most famous lines of Italian literature.
Switching places, although hardly an inspired move, is the simplest way to stir the waters without fear of rocking the boat.
Unless Western leaders seek to punish Putin for his return, there is no reason to think it will undermine the "reset" of recent years.
Fifty-eight percent think stories about conflicts between the two are dreamed up by journalists and opposition politicians.
At the same time, both want to protect a circle of friends and acquaintances who have grown rich during their years in power.
During the financial crisis, the prime minister spent lavishly to soften the pain, increasing pensions by 24% in real terms in 2009 and another 13% in 2010.
But the support, although high, is thin, resting on economic performance and little else.
Even as the economy stabilized after the worst of the global crisis, the percentage who think the country is heading in the right direction fell during the past year from 48% to 36%.
Aware of this, the two leaders have already announced reforms to simplify rules for investors and privatize large stakes in state-owned companies.
Yet there is also the chance that he will survive for long enough to see reforms bear fruit -- and claim a share of the credit.
