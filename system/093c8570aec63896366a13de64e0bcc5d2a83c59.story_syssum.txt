Yanukovich's supporters rallied outside the commission Tuesday and vowed not to leave until their candidate was named the winner, Ukrainian news agencies and state media reported.
In an exclusive interview with CNN on Tuesday, Yanukovich called on Tymoshenko to accept defeat and remember the pro-Western Orange Revolution that swept her to power.
"Medvedev congratulated Yanukovich on the completion of the election campaign, which was highly rated by international observers, and the success achieved at the presidential election," a Kremlin statement news statement said.
Yushchenko ran for a second term this year, but, blamed for Ukraine's faltering economy, he did not make the runoff.
This year's elections, by contrast to those in 2004, got a clean bill of health from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which sent observers.
