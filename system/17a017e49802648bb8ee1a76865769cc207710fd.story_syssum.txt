Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- NBC host Jay Leno is going back to late nights after a low-rated experiment in prime time, the network announced Sunday.
The goal is to keep all three hosts, but nothing was a done deal as of Sunday, he said.
Leno's move to prime time was a risk for NBC, because it put a talk show up against scripted prime-time shows and ran it five days a week.
"What they didn't realize was that the people who watched Leno in late night were not necessarily the same people who watched in prime time, so there was no reason to believe that his audience would follow him to prime time," Berman said.
Moving "Tonight" -- which has held its current slot for decades -- back a half-hour is likely to hurt the show, and Berman predicted that NBC will be unable to keep all three hosts.
