Then stop right now.
Regardless of the reason, there are too many good people getting bad gifts.
We have all received gifts that require us to fake a smile as our eyes dart around desperately hoping to locate the receipt.
And in keeping with that classic holiday tale, we will start by looking at holidays past in the hopes that you won't replicate the gift-giving catastrophes of bygone days.
The most astounding gift was a voucher for a Botox treatment given to Hanadi Kalla -- she was 26 years old at the time.
Here are a few of the gems: an ice scraper for the car, a battery organizer, Pyrex dishes, and my favorite was this gift to Beth Richardson: A replacement car antenna -- yes, installation was included.
Look, we have all re-gifted things.
Here are examples of what not to do.
Re-gifting should be in the original packaging and the gift should look new.
And then there was the box of chocolates given to @maverick_kris -- only problem was that he's diabetic.
Yet for some reason in this world of instant communication where we are all connected via e-mail, text, and/or social media, some would prefer to just guess at what the person may like.
There may have been a time when these seemed like the least thoughtful gift, but I think most would prefer these over cinnamon flavored candles or a re-gifted fern.
