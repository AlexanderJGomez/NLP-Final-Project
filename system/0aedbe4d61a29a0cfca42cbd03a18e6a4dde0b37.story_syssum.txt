Deeds had gone out to the barn to feed the horses.
Less than 24 hours before the November 19 stabbing, Deeds' son had undergone an evaluation by mental health professionals while he was under an emergency custody order.
"The system failed my son," Deeds said he told a representative of the county agency that manages mental health care.
The next morning, Gus stabbed his father in the chest and head.
"I want people to remember the brilliant, friendly, loving kid that was Gus Deeds," his father said.
