(CNN) -- The leader of Colombia's main leftist rebel group -- the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -- died in a military operation in the country's southwest, President Juan Manuel Santos said Saturday.
The military operation that took place Friday in the state of Cauca also killed Cano's communications chief, a female friend and members of his security team, Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon told reporters.
They called on authorities in Colombia, and specifically on President Santos, to allow them the opportunity to give Cano a dignified burial.
"This is not the first time that the oppressed and exploited in Colombia are mourning one of its greatest leaders.
Senior officials in the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama said that they believe Cano's death will pose a serious challenge to the FARC going forward.
"We firmly support the efforts of the Colombian people, their security forces, and President Santos to combat the FARC," she said.
CNN affiliate Caracol TV reported that authorities also found large quantities of the cigarettes the FARC leader is thought to smoke.
