Jones, who faces five murder counts, was scheduled to have a first-appearance hearing Friday morning but waived his right to appear.
According to reports from the state Department of Social Services, case workers had expressed concerns about the children in the past, as early as 2011, but the most recurring complaint was that the Jones' house was a mess.
The first DSS visit came in September 2011, a report says, when a caseworker visited the home because of allegations that the kids -- at the time, only three -- were dirty and not attending school.
In May 2012, after the couple had separated, the caseworker visited and the mother gave the caseworker documents indicating some domestic abuse issues.
The mother, who was pregnant with the couple's fifth child, went to visit her mother in Ohio in August 2012, and DSS submitted the case for closure.
Jones admitted to the case manager that he had spanked his son, and the case manager told Jones to refrain from physical discipline.
The case was closed in July, but a case manager was called on August 13 after allegations that Jones beat his son, leaving bruising, and that he was not feeding them properly, at times making all five kids split a 20-piece chicken nugget dinner, the DSS report states.
It's unclear how or why Jones allegedly killed his children, but acting Sheriff Lewis McCarty of Lexington County told reporters that Jones drove for several days with their decomposing bodies in the back of his SUV.
When Jones was picked up Saturday at a police checkpoint in Mississippi, he seemed "very strange, maybe somewhat disoriented, a little bit on the violent side," McCarty said.
"We know that the angels are with us, but your prayers are helping us cope," Tim Jones Sr. said.
He described his son as "a very loving father, brother and son" and said the family was heartbroken.
