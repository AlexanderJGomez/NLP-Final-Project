New York (CNN) -- Many times I've watched in dismay as crowds of Moammar Gadhafi supporters gathered to wave flags in front of Libya's former dictator -- in particular, two years ago, when the convicted murderer Abdul Al Megrahi returned to his home country under the guise of near-death, to be welcomed as a hero, banners waving, Gadhafi embracing the man who helped him kill my brother.
Today, as I look at the images streaming from halfway around the world, my heart is deeply moved by what I see on the faces of a liberated people.
But yet I fear that with his death goes a warehouse of secrets and lies that could have been revealed in order to salve the souls of Libyan families who lost loved ones during this regime.
Many times I have been accused of wanting revenge, of not tempering my desire to see Gadhafi and all his cohorts brought to heel.
Today, as ever, it has also been about justice for the 6.5 million Libyans, who no longer need to be paid to look happy when the world's cameras point their way.
