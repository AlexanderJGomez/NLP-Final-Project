Paul Chambers was originally fined Â£385 ($603) and ordered to pay thousands in court costs after being found guilty in 2010 of sending a "menacing tweet" that read: "Crap!
Thousands of people joined an online campaign to support Chambers, retweeting his message, and recently posting Twitter comments under the hashtag #twitterjoketrial.
In its ruling, the court said: "The appeal against conviction will be allowed on the basis that this 'tweet' did not constitute or include a message of a menacing character.
The hashtags #Paul Chambers and #twitterjoketrial were both trending in the UK Friday, but if anyone was opposed to the verdict they were not immediately visible on the social networking site.
