Monsanto claimed that the seeds could only be used for one growing season, meaning their offspring could not be saved and replanted without compensation.
"Bowman planted Monsanto's patented soybeans solely to make and market replicas of them thus depriving the company of the reward patent law provides for the sale of each article," said Justice Elena Kagan.
Those soybeans cost more and farmers must agree not to replant their progeny, thus buying seeds each year.
He used the patented soybeans for his main spring crop, but went to a local grain elevator and purchased so-called commodity seeds for a riskier, late-season crop.
"If exhaustion [first-sale doctrine] is eliminated, rather, for the progeny seed, then you are taking away the ability of people to exchange these goods freely in commerce," he told the court during February oral arguments.
"America's leadership in fostering the incentive to invest in research and development has created the world's leading innovation economy, with millions of high-technology jobs-not just in our field of agriculture, but in other R&D-intensive fields like medicine, biotechnology, computer science and environmental science," said David Snively, Monsanto's general counsel.
"Our holding today is limited -- addressing the situation before us, rather than every one involving a self-replicating product," she said.
The case is Bowman v. Monsanto Company (11-796).
