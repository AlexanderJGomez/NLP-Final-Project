She had already taken a break on a tree stump near the road.
But the victory was sweet for a woman who just six months before had primarily relied on a wheelchair to get around, a woman who had lived in her house for two years without walking to the mailbox.
"I could no longer participate in life's activities and was forced to become a spectator while people around me lived their life," she wrote on iReport.com.
She was heavy throughout high school and college but says her weight never really affected her life until 2003, when a series of setbacks sent her into a downward spiral.
Borawski lost her church job of 15 years and moved more than 200 miles to start anew.
"I think starting over as a college freshman had to be a challenge -- almost just as impressive."
The extra pounds she was carrying only made the condition worse.
She was working at the college and traveled around campus in an electric wheelchair.
She could only shop at stores that had mobile carts; it took her a week to carry in her groceries from the car because she could only carry one or two bags at a time.
When the sister hung up, Borawski went to the refrigerator and took out a bottle of peach soda.
A quick calculation made Borawski realize she had been drinking nearly 7,000 calories a week in soda -- the equivalent of 2 pounds.
Soon after, she restricted her calorie intake to 1,000 calories a day (experts warn against eating less than 1,200 calories a day because it sends your body into starvation mode).
Almost a year later, she showed up in Bowden's office doorway.
Every time she lost 20 pounds, Borawski went to the store and bought a pair of pants in the next size smaller.
To celebrate losing 200 pounds, she bought a black and white diamond ring.
She eats around 1,400 calories to maintain her weight at a healthy 150 pounds.
I am blessed beyond measure and can't wait to see what the future holds for me!"
