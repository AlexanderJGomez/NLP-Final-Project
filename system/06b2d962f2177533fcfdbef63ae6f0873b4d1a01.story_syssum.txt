Rapiejko sped around another officer as Valencia walked through a business park, hit the man from behind with the left side of his front bumper.
The officer, who has been a cop for more than a decade but joined the Marana Police Department in 2014, said he was 50 yards away from the suspect and worried a missed shot might hit another officer or bystanders.
Video of the car striking Valencia sparking nationwide debate on what type of force police should use to go after armed suspects.
Valencia faces 15 charges, including three counts of aggravated assault, three counts of armed robbery and possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited possessor.
