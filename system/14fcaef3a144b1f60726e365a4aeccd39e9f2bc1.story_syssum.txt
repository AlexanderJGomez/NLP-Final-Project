Suzhou, China, is blanketed by the most snow the city has had in 25 years, according to I-Reporter Susan Arthur.
The storm also has cost the nation's economy $4.5 billion, according to figures released Wednesday by the Civil Affairs Ministry.
The winter precipitation had caused at least 49 deaths due to collapsed roofs and treacherous travel conditions, the Ministry of Civil Affairs and local officials said.
