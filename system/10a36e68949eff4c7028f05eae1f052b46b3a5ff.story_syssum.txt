Beijing (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton held talks with a string of Chinese officials in Beijing on Wednesday but appeared to gain little traction on the sensitive issue of the competing maritime claims of China and its neighbors in the region.
Some Japanese media outlets reported Wednesday that the Japanese government had agreed to buy the islands from the family, a claim the government's chief Cabinet secretary, Osamu Fujimura, declined to confirm, saying talks on the matter were continuing.
Both the Chinese and the U.S. camps sought to play down the cancellation of Clinton's meeting with Vice President Xi on Wednesday, saying he had also called off meetings with other foreign officials.
Instead of Xi, Clinton met Vice Premier Li Keqiang, who is widely expected to take over from Wen Jiabao as premier at the end of the leadership transition early next year.
"Both President Obama and I have said frequently that the United States welcomes the rise of a strong, prosperous and peaceful China," she said Wednesday.
The resulting naval standoff between the two countries lasted for more than three months and aroused fears of an open conflict before the Philippines withdrew its ships in June, citing stormy weather.
"While the likelihood of major conflict remains low, all of the trends are in the wrong direction, and prospects of resolution are diminishing," the International Crisis Group said in a July report.
