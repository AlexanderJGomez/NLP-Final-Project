Ronaldo, who was on the receiving end last season as his team were pipped by the Catalan giants for the title, does not expect history to be repeated with his compatriot Jose Mourinho now in charge at the Bernabeu.
"The Clasico is obviously an important match because we will play against a direct opponent," he told the official Real Madrid website.
"This will not be decisive though, but whoever does win will surely be considered to be the champions for the next week at least," he told his club's official website.
Both teams are expected to be a virtual full strength, with the home side having a doubt over Gaby Milito, who missed training Sunday, while Kaka remains sidelined for Real Madrid.
Argentina ace Messi has scored in three out of their last four victories over Real, including a double in their 6-2 rout in the Bernabeu two seasons ago.
The return El Clasico will see Real entertain Barca on the weekend of April 16/17 in the title run-in.
