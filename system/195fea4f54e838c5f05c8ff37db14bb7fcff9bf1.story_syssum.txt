Let's get six kids poised to enter kindergarten together to ask what they expect from their "big" school, which is how my littlest one referred to kindergarten before she started.
A guy sitting around with a small group of precocious kids who say the darndest things, like the one where the adorable girl says she wants to turn her brother into a puppy so she can take him to school and say, "Hey everybody here's my puppy brother."
Always wanting to be prepared, I had questions ready: "What are you excited about kindergarten?"
But the kids, five of whom attended Morningside Montessori School in Manhattan, the same nursery school as my daughters, had other ideas.
How could I possibly expect kids to sit around talking with me when there were Legos in the playroom and a "Jake and the Neverland Pirate" ship and a soccer game?
Next time, never let the kids take over "Simon Says."
