The officers, members of the police's elite Special Action Force (SAF) unit, were killed in a 12-hour firefight with two Muslim rebel groups in the southern province of Maguindanao at the weekend.
"Our 44 fallen heroes from our police force, the youngest at 26 and the most senior at 39 years old, pushed themselves and exerted all their effort to do what they could, not only for themselves and their families, but for our beloved country," he said.
Philippine authorities say they believe he was killed in the raid, but are yet to conduct DNA testing to confirm this.
Police Chief Superintendent Noli G. Talino, deputy director of the Special Action Force, delivered a speech recounting how the satisfaction of the assault on Marwan soured as the commandos became pinned down during the extraction.
Last year, it signed a peace agreement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the largest rebel group in the region.
The MILF agreed to end hostilities in return for the establishment of a more autonomous Muslim region in the south.
On Wednesday, Aquino delivered a speech to the nation vowing that the deaths would not derail the deal with the MILF, saying the fallen police had given their lives for the cause of peace.
But Benigno said in his speech that "even if the MILF and BIFF now constitute two different groups, many of them are related by blood or by affinity.
"In order to give meaning to their deaths, we must resolve not to let something like this happen again," read the statement.
