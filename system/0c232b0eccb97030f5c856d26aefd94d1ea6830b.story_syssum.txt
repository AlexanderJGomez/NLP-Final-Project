Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has recently been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and website based in Brooklyn, New York.
Some of them are as young as 18 and only months away from their first visit to Helmand province in September 2010.
A couple of years ago, Vice Magazine published a photo essay in which he visited the homes of badly injured soldiers returned from Iraq or Afghanistan.
A week before we set off for the embed, I asked Stuart what kind of experience we were letting ourselves in for and he said: "Not only are the Parachute Regiment Britain's most elite soldiers, they are the most brutal of British troops.
"Recently what's happened is that many former veterans have had a "call to arms" and returned to the forces again.
The Parachute Regiment were there when it became very intense and at the time a Member of Parliament called John Reid was quoted as saying, 'I'd be quite happy that a single shot is not fired in Afghanistan.'
Before we set off to meet the Paras, Stuart introduced us to a young man named Richard Dare who'd been a private in the Royal Anglians.
We were met on the door by a dashing officer who arranged for a private to show us our room -- a basic little number in the middle of the barracks which, while not five star, would certainly meet our needs for the week.
I remember feeling pretty pleased with ourselves that we'd been given this amazing access, thinking we'd have carte blanche to wander around and check out the comings and goings of the most elite units in the world.
Then the sergeant major introduced himself and told us to get in line with the rest of the troops.
