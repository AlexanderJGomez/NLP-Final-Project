Chua, a second generation Chinese American, mother of two and Yale Law School professor, argues that Chinese moms churn out whip-smart kids precisely because they don't allow childhood frivolity like sleepovers or play dates, along with just about everything else that is social, fun or distracting, including TV, video games, sleepaway camp and auditioning for the school play.
We simply don't have the fortitude or patience to push through our children's resistance.
We coddle and cajole our children as we gently nudge them passive aggressively to do their chores and their homework.
Go to any school today with a "progressive" philosophy and administrators proudly espouse the virtues of addressing the "whole child" and creating an independent, creative, empathetic individual.
The Western touchy-feely approach runs counter to the Chinese Mom philosophy.
Chua claims that heaping shame and ridicule on her children drives them to success.
After all, Chinese moms are in the trenches, toiling for hours to ensure excellence -- anything short becomes almost pathologically personal.
Do we want our children to succeed academically?
But the Western moms I know, particularly working mothers, have neither the desire nor time to run such an extreme household.
It's more practical and better for everyone to have our kids tutored by anyone but us: college students, teachers, or even folks at any of the multitude of educational centers that have sprouted across the country.
Maybe that was worth missing all of the sleepovers and play dates and summer camp, but then again, maybe not.
