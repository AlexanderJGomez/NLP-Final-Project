And on November 9, 1989, the people in occupied East Germany took control of their own destinies when they literally hammered the Berlin Wall to the ground.
Since August 13, 1961, when East Germany erected the terrible barrier that cut off West Berlin from East Berlin and East Germany, the wall became a dreaded symbol of isolation and despair.
The United States had long supported German unification and we backed the efforts of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other German leaders to move toward rapid political and economic integration of East Germany into the Federal Republic.
Under this formula, the two German governments negotiated the internal terms of reunification while the four occupying powers -- the United States, the Soviet Union, France and Great Britain -- addressed its international aspects.
The successful talks resulted in the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany signed by all six parties in Moscow on September 12, 1990.
In 1989, after all, the President still had further business to do with Soviet leaders, even as their country was rapidly imploding.
That magical moment is a reminder to all people everywhere in the world -- those alive then, today and well into the future.
