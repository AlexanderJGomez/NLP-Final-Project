Saleh has threatened to withdraw all members of his party from the national government and warned the prime minister he could face imprisonment.
As a result, Saleh threatened to imprison Basendowah if he does not listen to his orders, a presidential aide who asked not to be named because of the sensitive nature of the issue.
Saleh threatened to withdraw all members of his party from the national government to protest the way Hadi's administration is dealing with the political crisis in the country, embroiled in discord and violence.
Saleh is still the president of the largest party in the country and must be treated with respect," said a senior GPC aide who asked to remain anonymous.
Mohammed Qahtan, a senior opposition Joint Meeting Parties official, said it's sad that Saleh's GPC officials are remaining quiet about Saleh's maneuverings.
