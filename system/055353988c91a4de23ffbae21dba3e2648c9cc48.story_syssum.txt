(CNN) -- Sonia Sotomayor, who rose from humble roots in a Bronx, New York, housing project to a high-powered legal career, was sworn in Saturday as the 111th justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.
As her mother, Celina, held a ceremonial Bible, Sotomayor beamed as she waved to relatives and guests when she entered the room for the public ceremony.
The other justices plan to return early from their three-month recess to hear a case September 9 on free speech and campaign finance laws.
David Souter, whom Sotomayor replaces on the bench, was not there.
President Obama, who did not attend the swearing-in, will welcome his first high court appointee to the White House for a reception Wednesday.
Many Republicans portrayed her as a judicial activist intent on reinterpreting the law to conform with her own liberal political beliefs.
Sotomayor graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University and attended Yale Law School, where she was editor of the Yale Law Journal.
Her supporters touted her as someone with bipartisan favor and historic appeal.
Prior to her judicial appointments, Sotomayor was a partner at a private law firm and spent time as an assistant district attorney prosecuting violent crimes.
