A nationwide shortage of a commonly used imported drug used in capital punishment has prompted 15 states on Monday to urge the U.S. Justice Department to intervene.
As state attorneys general, we are tasked with enforcing those laws, including in instances where capital punishment is authorized for the most heinous of crimes," according to attorneys general from the 15 states.
Propofol is a surgical anesthetic that in large doses can be administered fatally, but has never been used in the U.S. to put prisoners to death.
It was used in a U.S. execution for the first time in December 2010, when it was administered as the first ingredient in a three-drug cocktail used in a lethal injection given to an Oklahoma inmate.
Many capital punishment opponents claim sodium thiopental, which renders the prisoner  unconscious, can wear off too quickly, and that some prisoners would actually be  awake and able to feel pain as the procedure  continued.
The European manufacturers of both pentobarbital and sodium  thiopental have opposed using their products for executions in the  United  States.
Eighteen have been executed so far in 2012.
