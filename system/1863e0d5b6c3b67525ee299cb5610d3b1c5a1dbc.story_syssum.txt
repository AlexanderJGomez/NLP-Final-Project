I love to come to New York and any time I got a chance, when Les Paul was still alive, I would always try to schedule to see him play.
At one point, Sir Paul got up on stage with Les Paul and started clowning around with him, saying how much the Beatles loved him and stole his songs but had never been able to give him any credit.
I've been a huge Beatles fan from day one, when I was ten years old and watched the Ed Sullivan Show, the television program that introduced the Beatles to the United States.
We love making music and that was inspired by Sir Paul.
