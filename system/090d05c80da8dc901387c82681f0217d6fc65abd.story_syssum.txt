The Department of Energy's Blue Ribbon Commission has been given the task of finding an alternative to the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada, which President Obama has vowed to close.
It is expected to take 18 months for the commission to conclude its findings, and that isn't sitting well with several lawmakers from states with temporary nuclear waste storage sites.
"Keeping waste scattered across the country, or in the case of Washington State at Hanford, is no longer an option," Inslee said in a statement.
If the blue-ribbon commission decides to abandon Yucca Mountain as a nuclear storage facility, there are concerns in southern Nevada over what will be done with the site.
The search for future uses of Yucca only came into question, according to Voegele and others, when the Department of Energy filed a petition to withdraw its Nuclear Regulatory Commission license application for Yucca Mountain earlier this month, effectively killing the project.
Gary Hollis, the chairman of the Nye County Board of Commissioners, says closing Yucca Mountain slams the door on 4,000 construction jobs and about 1,500 permanent jobs that would have been created if the site ever got up and running.
