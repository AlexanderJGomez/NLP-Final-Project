The evolution of that question factors deeply in the plans of game hardware manufacturers and software development companies heading into this week's Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles.
I spoke with five prominent gaming companies -- Sony, Microsoft, Electronic Arts, Bethesda and 2K Games -- who will be pulling back the curtain at E3 on their latest and greatest titles, features and plans.
Sony is also prepared to broaden play beyond the traditional console, with software enhancements and games for its PS Vita handheld device.
Consumer trends since the handheld console's launch in February show an appetite for small, indie games that take less time to play, he said.
Microsoft is expected to show off enhancements to its Kinect motion controller, which the company hopes will transform the Xbox from a gaming device into an entertainment center for the entire family.
Pete Hines, vice president of public relations and marketing for Bethesda, said their big titles for E3 are designed with the heavy-duty player in mind.
Christoph Hartmann, president of 2K, believes their E3 lineup of games will appeal to the type of gamer who wants to spend a lot of time playing.
So whether you want to spend hours gaming on a TV screen or just minutes on a smartphone, E3 is poised to show you new experiences.
