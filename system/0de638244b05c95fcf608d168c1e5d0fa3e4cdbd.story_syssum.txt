Los Angeles (CNN) -- Additional police officers were patrolling Los Angeles International Airport and two other airports Wednesday after a former Transportation Security Administration employee was accused of making a false threat against LAX, authorities said.
Nna Alpha Onuoha, a former Transportation Security Administration employee, made his initial appearance in a federal court in Los Angeles on Wednesday afternoon to face a count of making a false threat and a count of making threats against interstate commerce, said Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office.
After his resignation Tuesday, Onuoha allegedly left a package at TSA's LAX headquarters addressed to a TSA employee, the FBI said.
A second phone call was received by TSA from a male caller, also believed to have been Onuoha, who again advised the TSA employee that specific terminals at LAX should be evacuated, the FBI said.
At Onuoha's apartment, the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force found a note taped inside a closet containing an unspecified threat citing the 9/11 anniversary.
After waiving his Miranda rights, Onuoha told the FBI that the note referred to how he intended to start preaching in the streets on September 11, 2013, court papers said.
