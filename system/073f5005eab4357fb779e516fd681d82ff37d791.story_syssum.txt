"People of all religious groups here rather consider her an inalienable part [of India] and therefore we would strongly want the remains to be in India."
Pope John Paul II beatified Mother Teresa in 2003 and she could be canonized by her centennial birthday next year -- a saint in the heavens whose resting place on Earth remains a devilish debate.
