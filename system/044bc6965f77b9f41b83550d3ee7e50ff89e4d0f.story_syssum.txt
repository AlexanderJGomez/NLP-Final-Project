The sweat-stained sheets of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, still on her bed, a woman quarantined in a Dallas apartment said Thursday that she desperately wants her family's nightmare to end.
Louise told CNN's Cooper by phone that she is checking her temperature every hour, and based on that and everything else, isn't sick.
She said no one brought food Thursday to four people who can't leave to get it themselves, at least until later in the day.
And Louise, her son and her nephews must wait 21 days from when Duncan first showed symptoms before they can leave the apartment.
If it were up to the Dallas County director of homeland security, the four people quarantined shouldn't be stuck in the apartment at all.
"Those people in the apartment are part of Dallas County, and they're going to be treated with utmost respect and dignity in this unusual situation.
"We are working to get the response, which has been a good response, strengthened every hour of the day," the judge said.
Duncan was taken by ambulance to the hospital on Sunday, September 28, after Louise's 35-year-old daughter saw him "shaking really hard" and with a fever when she came by to give him tea.
But Wayne doesn't want his 13-year-old son, who is the youngest person quarantined in the apartment of his mother, Louise -- to know that what he's feeling.
Wilfred Smallwood, Duncan's half-brother, said his 21-year-old son is also among those quarantined in Louise's apartment, where he lived.
Still, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta said the continuing presence of the sheets, on which Duncan may have transmitted the virus through sweating, are disturbing.
"We've talked about the fact that this virus can live outside the body, can live on surfaces.
