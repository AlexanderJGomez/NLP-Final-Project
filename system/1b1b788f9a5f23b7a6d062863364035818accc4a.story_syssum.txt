(CNN)So now the real trial is underway: What does the surviving Boston Marathon bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, deserve and why?
Cruelty really provides us a lens into the worst of the worst of the worst.
And then there's Tsarnaev's lack of remorse -- opening day, the prosecutor's final shot of Tsarnaev locked up, giving the security camera the finger.
No doubt Tsarnaev regrets his present predicament, regrets the negative publicity he's brought his friends and family and most poignantly regrets running over and killing his older brother while trying to escape.
As the prisoners inside Washington D.C.'s now defunct Lorton Central Prison once described the street code to me:  No snitching, but if someone dies, then "the dead guy did everything."
But in the same article, these leading developmental psychologists themselves characterized it as an "open question whether under real-world conditions the decision making of mid-adolescents is truly comparable with that of adults."
Think about it:  When a 19-year-old bravely dashes into a burning building, risking his life to save children inside, we celebrate this heroism.
Worse, the historical record and headlines in the next day's anti-death penalty news organizations will probably proclaim:  "Jury Chooses Life for the Marathon Bomber" -- even if overwhelmingly the people's representatives were to vote for death as the more appropriate punishment.
And yet, if we really commit ourselves to having the punishment fit the crime, if we rightly reserve the death penalty for the most heinous crimes and criminals, surely the Boston Marathon bomber stands among the worst of the worst.
