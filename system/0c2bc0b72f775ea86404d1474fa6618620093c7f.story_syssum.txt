Ibrahim was condemned to die by hanging after she declined to profess she is a Muslim, the religion of her father.
"I'm not aware that any release is imminent," Wani told CNN.
"There is pressure on her from Muslim religious leaders that she should return to the faith," Wani told CNN in a TV exclusive.
"Even last week, they brought in sheikhs and she told them, 'I'm pretty sure I'm not going to change my mind.'
Sharia law as practiced in Sudan prohibits carrying out the death sentence on an expectant woman until two years after she gives birth.
Their complaint alleged that she went missing for years, and her family was shocked to find out she married a Christian, according to her attorney, Mohamed Jar Elnabi.
"The police originally called for the case to be dismissed, but these people went back and added another charge ... which is adultery, by saying she was their sister and a Muslim.
"An illegitimate marriage does not result in legally recognized offspring, which means that my son and the new baby are no longer mine," he said.
"He cannot live without her," he said.
The court had warned her to renounce her Christianity by May 15, but she has steadfastly maintained she is a Christian and will remain so.
"I'm hoping that, given the way people have come together around the world -- which I want to thank them for," he said.
"The fact that a woman could be sentenced to death for her religious choice, and to flogging for being married to a man of an allegedly different religion, is abhorrent and should never be even considered," said Manar Idriss, Amnesty International's Sudan researcher.
The last time Sudan executed someone for apostasy was in 1985 when a man criticized Sharia law.
