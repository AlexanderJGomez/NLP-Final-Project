Viry-Chatillon is just one of the many banlieues -- heavily immigrant, working class suburbs -- dotted around the periphery of the French capital.

"We feel like we're alone, and when we talk about the banlieues we only talk about its problems and never about the opportunity the banlieues represent today," El Jarroudi says.
