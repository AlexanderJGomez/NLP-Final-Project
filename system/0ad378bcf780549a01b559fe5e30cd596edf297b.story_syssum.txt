Three years ago Sunday Arrianna watched her mother Kim Dahl drive a school bus loaded with children across the Mississippi River when the bridge began to buckle up and down.
Millions of viewers saw the jaw-dropping images of the school bus as it teetered on the edge of a broken stretch of highway, with nothing but a guard rail separating it from a deadly fall.
With the parking brake on, Dahl kept the bus in place while everyone made it out the rear emergency door safely.
This particular mother-daughter pair say they've always had a tight bond but Arrianna says she and her mother have grown even closer since their ordeal.
Dahl broke her back in the fall and that's been the primary cause of complications since.
"I don't know if life will ever be normal like it was before July of '07 and prior, but we've made the best for it," said Dave Dahl.
"Most of the time when my mom is in the hospital or getting surgeries, I have to step in and be the surrogate mother to my younger siblings," Arrianna explains.
She adds it can get difficult once in awhile, but these days she simply reminds herself who she's doing it for.
The amount of punitive damages plaintiffs are seeking against URS is "hard to say," said Dahl's attorney Bill Harper, who estimated it could be as much as $100 million.
On Tuesday Kim Dahl and Arrianna visited the site of the collapse -- where the new I-35 West bridge stands.
She recalls hearing her mother sometimes say things about how life would be easier if none of this had ever happened.
She had the same bus routes for years and knew the kids and their parents well.
So far, they've made it as far as Florida to the east and Colorado to the west.
Given the path Kim Dahl and her loved ones have traveled since 2007, that phrase could be the family motto too.
