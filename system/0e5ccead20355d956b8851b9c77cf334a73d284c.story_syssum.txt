(CNN)Real Madrid returned to winning ways Saturday with a 3-0 victory over mid-table Espanyol at the Santiago Bernabeu, despite playing the majority of the second half with ten men.
Yet  after the game, Real boss Carlo Ancelotti was quick to defend Bale when speaking to reporters.
"It could be in this moment the fans asked for a pass to Cristiano that he didn't make because, like all strikers in front of goal, they try to score.
Looking beyond that, Ancelotti will be seeking harmony in the squad as Real prepare for the second leg of their Copa Del Rey last-16-tie against city rivals Atletico on Thursday.
It is difficult for us but we are going to play our best and playing at home will help us."
