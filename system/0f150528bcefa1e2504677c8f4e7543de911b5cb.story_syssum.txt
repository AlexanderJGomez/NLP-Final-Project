Down 2-0 in the four-match series, the second-ranked Indians went into the third encounter with doubts about the pitch at the WACA after ground staff were filmed on Thursday night drinking beer and walking on the playing surface in bare feet.

Ryan Harris snared just one scalp in his first outing since November, but it was a key one as cricket's record run scorer Sachin Tendulkar was trapped leg before wicket for 15 to leave the 38-year-old "Little Master" still seeking his record 100th international century.
Warner shrugged off a blow to the head from a delivery by Umesh Yadav to pass three figures in 69 balls faced, reaching the milestone with a clubbed six off debutant medium pacer Vinay Kumar.
The experienced Zaheer Kahan and Ishant Sharma also suffered, giving up 44 from seven and 28 from five respectively.
