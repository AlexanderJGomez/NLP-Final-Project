That brings the total up to more than 30 women who have accused the comedian and actor of sexual assault in events going back decades.
A few days ago, it appeared that former "Cosby Show" cast mate Phylicia Rashad was condemning the women making the allegations.
She blamed the media for declaring "guilt without proof" and described Cosby as "a genius.
Over the past several months, allegations have painted Cosby as a sexual predator, a serial rapist, a man who, over many decades, allegedly drugged and assaulted women, many of whom had viewed him as a mentor and guide.
Which raises the question: Could a man accused of such things by so many ever deserve defense?
Maybe -- and I mean maybe -- you can continue a friendship with someone who has been accused, once, of rape, if you have asked the right questions and satisfied yourself that the one allegation is not true.
Every year, literally countless men who engage in sexual violence against women do not face charges, for reasons as varied and familiar as those given by the women in the Cosby scandal.
Boycotting these men, excluding them from our lives, not being their friends, their defenders, their devil's advocates.
This is where and how we take a stand.
