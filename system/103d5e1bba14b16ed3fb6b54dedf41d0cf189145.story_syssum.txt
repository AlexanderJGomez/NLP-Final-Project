CNN refutes all allegations by bloggers that it distorts its coverage of the events in Tibet to portray either side in a more favorable light.
The one image in question was used wholly appropriately in the specific editorial context and there could be no confusion regarding what it was showing, not least because it was captioned: "Tibetans throw stones at army vehicles on a street in the capital Lhasa."
Additionally, we have published video from the Chinese media apparently showing Tibetans attacking Chinese interests in Lhasa.
CNN's reputation is based on reporting global news accurately and impartially, while our coverage through the use of words, images or video always reflects a wide range of opinions and points of view on every story.
