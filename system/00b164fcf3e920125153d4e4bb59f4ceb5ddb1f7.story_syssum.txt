Police said they believe the gunmen entered the hotel by smuggling small pistols in their shoes, then hid in the bathroom for several hours before launching their attack.
In January, a bomb and gun attack by the Taliban on a restaurant in Kabul killed 21 people, most of them foreigners.
At least 11 people were killed and 22 were injured at the station, and at least six attackers were killed, according to a doctor at the hospital.
