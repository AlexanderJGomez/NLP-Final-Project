(CNN) -- Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who died Wednesday at 56, made the world "immeasurably better," the company's board of directors said in a statement.
Cook said the company is planning a "celebration of Steve's extraordinary life for Apple employees that will take place soon."
"We are grateful for the support and kindness of those who share our feelings for Steve," the family statement said.
Outside the original Apple store in Cupertino, California, a makeshift memorial was created Wednesday, with people leaving flowers and other items.
"We will honor his memory by dedicating ourselves to continuing the work he loved so much."
