(CNN) -- Beyond the noise of raucous crowds and angry protesters who have turned town hall meetings into shouting matches is genuine concern from ordinary citizens who are afraid that President Obama's health care proposals would only make things harder for them, experts say.
"This is going to take away my freedom," charged one man who wanted assurance from Specter that the private option for health insurance would stay viable.
"I think that's the fear," said Diana Owen, an associate professor of political science and the director of American studies at Georgetown University.
The themes coming up at town hall meetings across the country are broadly the same as doubts expressed during the campaign.
Obama originally asked Congress to send him a health care bill before the August recess, but neither chamber met the deadline.
And I think that's why the president wanted the House and the Senate to pass their versions before the August recess, because the president knew that the public would object to a lot of what is in these bills."
Obama's health care battle has been compared to former President Clinton's failed effort more than 15 years ago, but lawmakers didn't experience the same backlash during the Clinton years.
Cannon said the debate has "stunted the president's momentum" and will make it harder for his administration to get through the types of reforms they were hoping for.
"When Congress comes back they'll have to kind of rethink the plan and rethink particularly how they present it to the public.
and that means the Obama administration as well," she said.
