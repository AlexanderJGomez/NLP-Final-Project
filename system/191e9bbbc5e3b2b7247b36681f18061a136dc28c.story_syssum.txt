As you explore the lush Dingle Peninsula, you'll see how the Emerald Isle got its name.
Shaded green on many maps, these regions brighten the west coast of the Emerald Isle.
While the big tour buses clog the neighboring Ring of Kerry before heading east to kiss the Blarney Stone, in Dingle it still feels like the fish and the farm actually matter.
You'll see teenagers -- already working on ruddy beer-glow cheeks -- roll kegs up the streets and into the pubs in preparation for another night of music and craic (fun conversation and atmosphere).
It's littered with monuments reminding visitors that the town has been the choice of Bronze Age settlers, Dark Age monks, English landlords, and Hollywood directors ("Ryan's Daughter," and "Far and Away").
The Milestone B&B decorates its front yard not with a pink flamingo, but with an ancient pillar stone -- one of more than 2,000 stony pieces in the puzzle of prehistoric life here.
In the darkest depths of the Dark Ages, when literate life almost died in Europe, peace-loving, bookwormish monks fled the chaos of barbarian raids on the continent.
You're all alone, surrounded by dank mist and the realization that it was these monks who kept literacy alive in Europe.
Take your time at the Gallaras Oratory, circa A.D. 800, the sightseeing highlight of your peninsula tour.
From the Oratory, continue up the rugged one-lane road to the crest of the hill and then coast back to Dingle Town -- hungry, thirsty, and ready for a pint.
