The court was shown cell phone footage filmed by a witness in which a man who prosecutors said was Adebolajo, holding a bloody cleaver in his hands, spoke into the camera.
Remove your governments -- they don't care about you," he said, referring also to British Prime Minister David Cameron.
Describing the events of that day, the prosecutor said the two suspects drove at Rigby in a car traveling at 30 to 40 miles per hour.
Footage from a different surveillance camera showed two men dragging the soldier's limp body from the sidewalk into the middle of the road.
One woman stroked Rigby's body in a gesture of comfort, he said, while another engaged Adebolajo in conversation despite the fact that he was still holding the meat cleaver in his blood-covered hands.
He aimed it at the officers, although it was not loaded, the prosecutor said.
While the gun carried by Adebowale was not loaded, he also had on him the bloodstained knife he'd used to attack Rigby, the prosecutor said.
He was also given pain relief and taken to hospital.
The jury was told both men have pleaded guilty to a charge of possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.
They included a visit to a store where Adebolajo bought a five-piece set of kitchen knives and a knife sharpener, the prosecution said.
Security footage from Rigby's last train journey showed he was wearing a "Help for Heroes" hooded sweatshirt, in support of a charity that aids military veterans.
