(CNN) -- What is it about Christmas music that enters our very souls, calms us and even gets us to do things that are right for humanity?
However, it is music and song that has no rival in the ability to stir raw emotions.
The "home for Christmas" notion originates during World War I, when U.S. soldiers expected a quick victory, thinking they'd be back in the United States in time for the holidays.
We say, "Oh my, look here's an old tintype of Aunt Emily -- she was so kind and generous."
(This song of trying to entice a young lady to stay was written for the film "Neptune's Daughter," with Esther Williams and Ricardo Montalban.)
The congregation enjoyed it so much that it was repeated during Christmas services, and "Jingle Bells" took off from there.
Then there are Jimmy Boyd's "All I Want For Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth", The Singing Dogs version of "Jingle Bells" and Homer and Jethro's "Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer."
The emotional and often wonderful snapshots of our lives, past and present, all wrapped up for Christmas.
So this marketing campaign that started with our first footsteps is fine -- we need it.
Wouldn't it have been nice if those marketing guys figured out a way to make those 12 days of Christmas last for the other 353 days of the year?
