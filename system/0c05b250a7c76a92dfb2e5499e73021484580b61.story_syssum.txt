"That's where I was born, right under that tree," says Mhlongo, as he points out to a large ebony tree amidst the wildlife haven of South Africa's Kruger National Park.
Over the years, the two men -- one black, one white -- have forged a strong friendship and working relationship that's taking them from tracking Londolozi's wildlife to traveling the world as international spokesmen for South Africa's bushveld.
"When I grew up here, I sit quietly, listening to the different sound of animals, the sound of grasshoppers, the sound of the lion -- all that is part of my growing in nature because here, we don't have cell phones here, which makes me connect to the nature," says Mhlongo.
"So the bottom line is we're losing them and within 10 years if nothing is done we could have seen the last of the traditional trackers."
"It is very important to share the knowledge with other people, to give them the same skills like we have," says Mhlongo.
