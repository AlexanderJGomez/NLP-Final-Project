2:15 a.m. Jack (1 month) is sleeping between me and my wife because this way she can nurse while she dozes.
He's on his back, and there are no pillows or blankets around him, but I'm wide-awake, thinking about SIDS.
1:36 a.m. Jack (12 months) is sleeping in between us, again.
Lying next to his crib didn't work -- Jack kept crying, waking both of us.
I have to get up to drive my wife to New York, then turn around and drive back home with Jack, all on about three hours of sleep.
But this would require that my wife and I stay awake for longer than ten seconds once our heads hit the pillows.
11:21 p.m. Jack (18 months and a week) is no longer sick, but now he's back in our bed, every night.
Now we have to get him out of diapers and back in his own room.
4:25 a.m. Jack (3 years) has kicked the covers off me again and I wake up, shivering.
I go downstairs, turn on the TV, and fall asleep on the couch.
Last night in bed, he said, "Hey, why do I have to sleep in the middle?"
We made a big deal of it, his very own Big Boy Bed, and we let him pick out the dinosaur sheets and the dinosaur comforter.
On his birthday, my wife lay down with him at 8:30 and fell sound asleep.
I get back into bed with my wife and snuggle up next to her.
Hearing a noise, my wife and I go upstairs to check on Jack (6).
We lie down with him, three of us in a twin bed.
