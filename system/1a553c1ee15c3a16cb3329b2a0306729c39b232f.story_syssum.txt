Zoologists at the Smithsonian National Zoo have cross-fostered a cheetah cub, persuading a female cheetah to become a foster mom to an at-risk cub.
After two cubs were born to different mothers at the zoo, officials decided to have one mom tend to both to ensure their chance of survival.
When another singleton female cub was born to 9-year-old Zazi, the zoo biologists decided to sneak the first cub in with the second and see if Zazi would raise both as her own.
And then laid down in the nest box with him, and it took about 20 to 30 minutes before she realized that there were two cubs in there with her," Crosier said.
The female let out a loud chirp as the veterinarian tried to swab her mouth.
So we were training our younger males with that older experienced female, and she actually bred two of the boys in one day.
They'll stay with Zazi for another year, but they will likely get a breeding recommendation and go to other breeding centers.
