The September killing of 20-year-old Justin Valdez on that busy train was shocking enough.
The shooter, apparently picking the victim at random, shot the San Francisco State University student in the back.
But the phenomenon of witnesses being distracted by technology may continue, Gascon said.
The security footage of the incident is chilling.
Or you remember the guy who was so engrossed in his phone he almost walks right into a black bear.
The other day at the same train stop where Valdez boarded for the last time, a group of college students milled around, most of them too focused on their phones to notice a CNN camera focused on them.
