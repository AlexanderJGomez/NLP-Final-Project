Suarez denied the claims in a statement on his Facebook page, but United manager Alex Ferguson told reporters on Monday that Evra stands by his comments to French television channel Canal Plus.
United and Liverpool are bitter rivals, and Ferguson appealed to both sets of fans before the match at Anfield, asking them not to sing abusive chants about the clubs' respective tragedies in Munich and Hillsborough.
"There was not any of that silly chanting we have had in previous years.
"I am not aware of any instances in terms of British football," the 69-year-old Scot said.
Ferguson said Evra would be in contention to play in Romania, with last season's Champions League finalists United seeking to kickstart a faltering European campaign after picking up just two points from two Group C matches.
Rooney started on the bench against Liverpool following the news that he will be banned for all three of England's Euro 2012 finals group matches after his red card against Montenegro.
Nine-time European champions Real Madrid will seek a third successive Group D victory at home to French side Lyon in the clubs' ninth meeting in six years.
