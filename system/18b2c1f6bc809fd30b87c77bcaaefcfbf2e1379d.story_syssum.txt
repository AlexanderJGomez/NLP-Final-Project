Diena Thompson clutched a tissue in her right hand, frequently wiping her eyes as she told reporters that she couldn't believe it was her daughter whose body was found in a Georgia landfill.
You didn't just take her from me.
Authorities on Friday were combing were through a "tremendous mountain" of garbage at the landfill, a sheriff's spokeswoman said.
Justino said witnesses, including some children, saw her on the sidewalk in front of a vacant house that is being renovated after a fire.
The sister said she brought up the fight while she and her brother walked Somer home from school, and that Somer ran off from them, apparently upset.
Beseler held up a map dotted with markers as he said on CNN's "American Morning" that detectives have questioned more than 70 registered sex offenders or predators living within five square miles of Somer's home.
Authorities will work to pinpoint where the garbage load that contained the girl's body came from, Beseler said.
The investigation has now turned into a murder probe.
