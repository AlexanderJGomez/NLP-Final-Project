French authorities said the bodies of the three women were discovered in the Information Center of Kurdistan in Paris.
Turkey, the United States and the European Union have labeled the PKK a terrorist organization.
Kurdish leaders said they, too, were working to reduce tensions in the wake of the killings.
In recent days, the Turkish military bombed suspected PKK camps in the Qandil Mountains of northern Iraq.
Kurdish politicians from the BDP told CNN they would accompany the bodies of the three murdered women to their hometowns of Maras, Tunceli, and Adana for burial later this week.
