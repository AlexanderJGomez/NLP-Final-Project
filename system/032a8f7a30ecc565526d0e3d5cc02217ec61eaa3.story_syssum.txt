We're here to explain what causes this remarkable act of nature, what skygazers see and how those outside of Australia can join in the experience.
Sometimes referred to as a "happy accident of nature," a total solar eclipse occurs when the moon is perfectly aligned with both the sun and Earth, so it appears from our perspective that the sun is completely blocked.
Totality was expected to begin in Cairns at 0638 local time and was to last nearly two minutes.
Solar eclipses were shrouded in superstition in ancient times -- in China, for example, viewing total solar eclipses was important for divining the future success of an emperor.
There are changes in the color of the sky, the temperature drops, birds and animals behave in a peculiar manner and shadows sharpen, according to Rick Brown, an eclipse chaser from New York who is viewing his 14th total solar eclipse.
It's a phenomenal thing to see," he said, recalling his first experience.
On Twitter, there was a tweet-up devoted to the event and you can always get first-hand accounts of the event on iReport, where we asked people to share their solar eclipse photos and experiences.
That means when viewing any partial phase of a total eclipse, you need to wear proper solar eclipse glasses.
-- Keep your setup as portable, light and easy to assemble as possible in case you need to relocate in a hurry to escape clouds.
Veteran eclipse watchers all had the same advice for first-timers: don't waste time fiddling with cameras and telescopes that you miss soaking up that fleeting moment of complete darkness.
