In reality, of course, to create the startlingly elaborate sculptural portraits Mapes is known for, he has to be much more organized than that.
Each of Mapes' pieces are constructed from what he describes as "biographical DNA," the little pieces of physical information he pieces together to create a finished portrait.
"I'm occasionally reminded that I'm not a typical customer when the manager walks the envelope of prints out to me personally with a curious eye," he says.
"I tend to produce hundreds and hundreds of samples before I start working with the actual composition," he explains.
"I generally tape a number of photos on the wall and ponder where to go from there," he says.
At a distance, Mapes' work echoes the puritanical rigidity of the Dutch Masters, but when you get up close and really examine what his sculptural paintings are made of you'll notice photographs of bare legs and bits of cleavage filling out the skin tone of the Dutch Masters' subjects.
All this is an attempt to shift our perspectives, and hopefully inspire us to re-examine how we perceive what's around us.
