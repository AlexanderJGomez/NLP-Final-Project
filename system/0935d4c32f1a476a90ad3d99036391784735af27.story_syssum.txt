Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- A local court has set free a teenage boy after finding him guilty of stealing a policeman's sandals in a case that caused furor among Indonesians frustrated with perceived injustices against the poor and defenseless.
To be on the safe side, the boy was returned to his parents.
"Two high school students came here, took off the sandals they were wearing and walked home barefoot," said Budhi Kurniawan, of the non-governmental organization SOS Children's Villages and who helped start the campaign after hearing about the case.
To express disappointment over the verdict, the sandals would be given to different government institutions instead, Kurniawan said on Thursday -- namely the national police, the attorney general's office, the Supreme Court, the Justice and Human Rights Ministry and juvenile detention centers.
The Child Protection Commission, however, said the parents had filed a complaint with the Palu police after the alleged victim, 1st Brig.
According to Ihsan of the Commission, the police should have prioritized intervention and rehabilitation since the alleged offender is a minor.
A bill on the protection of children's rights is under deliberation and expected to pass this year in parliament.
It means that first the child needs to be returned to their parents for guidance, then given training and education, and the harshest would be rehabilitation with the right intervention.
This also is not the first time Indonesians have rallied around a victim of perceived injustice.
