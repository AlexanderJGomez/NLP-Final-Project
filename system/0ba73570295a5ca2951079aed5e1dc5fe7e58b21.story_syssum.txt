A few had woken up to head to early morning Christian prayers.
At one point, they burst into a room where Christians had gathered and took hostages, said lecturer Joel Ayora.
Whatever their religion, hundreds of students managed to escape, said Dennis Okari, a reporter with CNN affiliate NTV.
It wasn't until about 15 hours after the attack began that the explosions and gunfire around Garissa finally ended.
Okari, for instance, told CNN that he saw about 200 people sitting in the scorching mid-90-degree heat Thursday in a corner of a Garissa airstrip, surrounded by military officials.
One student, Japhet Mwala, recalled to AFP how "everyone started running" after hearing blasts and gunshots.
Such terrorism, sadly, isn't new to the people of eastern Kenya.
Needless to say, that aim isn't shared in most places -- particularly in Kenya, where more than 80% of citizens are Christian.
But Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta on Thursday urged people around the African nation "to stay calm as we resolve this matter."
