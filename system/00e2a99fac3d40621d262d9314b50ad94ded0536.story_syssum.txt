A newly published letter from Mrs. Lincoln requesting a sitter gives rare insight into the family's life inside the Lincoln White House, showing one way the family had to juggle their busy schedules, just like everyone else.
Mr. Harrington, We would like to have the services of Charles from today, at 2 P.M. until tomorrow at 11 A.M.
George Harrington was assistant secretary of the Treasury and Forbes' boss and handled personal financial matters for the Lincolns.
Forbes' close family relationship soured a year later when President Lincoln was assassinated.
"Lincoln," a film about the 16th president and his battle to end slavery, is up for 12 Academy Awards this year, including best picture.
