(CNN) -- Seventy-five Australian soldiers killed in the World War I battle of Fromelles have been identified, the first of about 250 whose remains were discovered at the site in France more than a year ago.
The battle of Fromelles remains the most fatal 24-hour period in Australian military history, Australian defense officials have said.
"I am also pleased to say that we have strong reason to believe that more identification could occur in the future," he said.
The final soldier will be buried at a special ceremony in July to mark the 94th anniversary of the battle, he said.
About 800 people from Britain and Australia who think they may have a relative buried at Fromelles have donated DNA to try to identify the bodies, said Peter Jones, the DNA consultant on the project.
But that's only half as many as the experts need, he said, since about 1,600 Commonwealth dead from the battle remain unaccounted for.
A full list of the soldiers identified and also their photos is available on the Australian Department of Defence Web site.
