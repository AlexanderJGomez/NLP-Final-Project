(CNN) -- On a number of occasions and in perfectly pitched and calibrated statements, President Obama has expressed his unequivocal support for the civil rights movement in Iran without appearing to interfere in Iranian domestic affairs.
It mostly will be abused by expatriate and entirely discredited opposition groups ranging from the monarchist supporters of Reza Pahlavi to the members of the Mojahedin Khalq Organization, and it will in turn strengthen the hand of the regime to denounce the Green Movement as funded by Americans.
As the whole world is now a witness to it, the civil rights movement in Iran is a nonviolent demand to exercise people's constitutional rights to participate in the democratic aspirations of their homeland, turned bloody only by the custodians of an Islamic republic who seem to be too conscious of their own illegitimacy.
If I were the president, I would reallocate that budget and spend it on enriching inner city public schools, enabling them to develop courses on modern Iranian and Islamic history.
Iranians are more than capable of dodging it and continuing with creative ways of civil disobedience and nonviolent strategies of pushing forward from their versions of the Montgomery, Alabama, bus boycott of 1955-1956 to their Civil Rights Act of 1968.
These are 1) the misappropriation of funds to promote democracy in Iran that will in fact abort it; 2) the fear of even more severe economic sanctions that will do nothing to the ruling elite except exacerbate its belligerence while hurting the very brave men and women daring the brutality of their government; and 3) the threat of military strike that, should it materialize, will have this hopeful uprising as its very first target while creating the condition of an open military coup in Iran, turning it to another Pakistan.
By wedding the freshly cut flower of Neda Aqa-Soltan's young life in the fertile soil of Rosa Parks' memory, Iranians and Americans will finally come together in their common dreams of basic human decency.
