When asked directly if he wanted to recruit Alonso, Whitmarsh responded: "Yes - any team would.
But any hopes McLaren had of luring Alonso back were quickly quashed, with the two-time world champion declaring he saw his long-term future with Ferrari.
Alonso was also given a dressing down by Ferrari chairman Luca di Montezemolo for appearing to criticize the team's car earlier in the season.
Alonso's solitary season with McLaren was a turbulent one, with in-fighting damaging team unity as both the Spaniard and rookie driver Lewis Hamilton challenged for the world championship.
