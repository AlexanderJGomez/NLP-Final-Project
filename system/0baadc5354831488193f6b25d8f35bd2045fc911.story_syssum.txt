An alleged al Qaeda operative accused of playing a role in the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania pleaded not guilty Tuesday to terrorism charges brought against him in federal court in New York.
Al Libi answered the few questions posed to him by Kaplan through a translator.
He is being held without bail, since Kaplan agreed with prosecutors that he poses a flight risk and is a danger the community.
U.S. officials say he was taken initially to a Navy ship for questioning before he was brought to the United States over the weekend.
A second coordinated attack on the U.S. Embassy in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, took place at virtually the same time on August 7,1998, killing embassy personnel there.
Al Libi was indicted in 2001 by the federal court in the Southern District of New York in the embassy bombings and in connection with his alleged roles in al Qaeda conspiracies to attack U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Somalia.
Al Libi's family members said they had received no news about him from the U.S. or Libyan governments and were shocked to learn that he had arrived in the United States.
His wife said he was no longer a member of al Qaeda, had a normal life and was seeking a job with the Libyan Oil Ministry.
A senior Obama administration official said it wasn't possible to give Libya consular access to al Libi until he had arrived in the United States.
