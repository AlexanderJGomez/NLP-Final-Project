Speaking to ABC's "This Week," Clinton also said the president has answered the central question she raised about him when she was his chief rival for the Democratic nomination last year.
"And, you know, the president, in his public actions and demeanor, and certainly in private with me and with the national security team, has been strong, thoughtful, decisive, I think he is doing a terrific job.
"When I left the presidential race after getting some sleep and taking some deep breaths, I immediately went to work for him in the general election.
And I gave him a bunch of other names of people who I thought would be great secretaries of state."
Some analysts have raised questions about how much power Clinton actually has in the administration, given that Obama and Vice President Joe Biden have done a great deal of international outreach themselves.
Asked whether there is any room for compromise on that issue, Clinton said the administration would not "prejudge the effort."
Clinton also addressed the growing tensions surrounding North Korea, and what she called its "very provocative and belligerent behavior" with recent tests of missile and nuclear technology.
She emphasized that North Korea's detention of two U.S. journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, is separate from the political issues.
"It is a humanitarian issue and the girls should be let go," Clinton said.
