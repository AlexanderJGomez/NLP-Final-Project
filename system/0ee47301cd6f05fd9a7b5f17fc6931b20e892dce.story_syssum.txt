(CNN)The Department of Homeland Security is increasing security checks at American airports because of concerns over new bomb-making instructions released by al Qaeda in Yemen (AQAP), the terrorist group which U.S. intelligence agencies believe may have been behind the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris, U.S. officials tell CNN.
The new issue of Inspire made clear it viewed lone wolf attacks by its supporters in the West as an increasingly important part of these efforts.
That recipe was downloaded and used by the Boston bombers and several other extremists in plots on both sides of the Atlantic.
Nor is it clear if the device would have any chance of getting through explosive scanners at airport security.
In August 2013 the British security agency MI5 revealed to the UK parliament's intelligence and security committee that "Inspire" has been "read by those involved in at least seven out of the 10 attacks planned within the UK since its first issue (in 2010).
We judge that it significantly enhanced the capability of individuals in four of these 10 attack plots."
