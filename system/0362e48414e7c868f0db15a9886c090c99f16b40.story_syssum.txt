BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Chen Xiao had pretty much given up making her own decisions and so decided to throw open her life to the whims of China's hundreds of millions of Internet users, known in China as netizens.
She charges about $3 an hour, and she's been asked to do almost everything from delivering pet food to caring for stray cats to taking a hot lunch to a homeless man.
So far, the most meaningful assignment she was given was attending a child's birth -- the father was a complete stranger who just wanted someone to take pictures and share the moment.
There was also a man who wanted to meet her for a few private hours at a ski chalet.
For now it is a good way to survive the financial crisis when many others are losing their jobs and businesses are going broke.
China's netizens will most likely make that decision for her as well.
