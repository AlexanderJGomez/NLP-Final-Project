Anthony "and her lawyers were well aware that her probationary placement was not to begin until her release from confinement," the appeals court ruling said.
The attorney general's office wrote that Anthony "upon her release (July 17), should have reported" for probation -- something she did not do.
In an emergency petition filed on Wednesday with the same appeals court, Anthony's defense team asked that the court overturn Perry's order before the required date.
Orange County Circuit Judge Stan Strickland had earlier ordered Anthony to serve a year of probation after her release in the charges involving her daughter, but a clerk misunderstood the judge and prepared an order that the judge later signed, instructing that Anthony would serve the probation while in custody awaiting trial.
