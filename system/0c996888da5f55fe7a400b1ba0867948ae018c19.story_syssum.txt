Pacquiao's next fight is in May next year while Mayweather is due in court next month to answer charges of domestic violence.
And according to Graham, the danger for eight-division world champion Pacquiao is that his legacy will be affected just as much by a failure to meet Mayweather in the ring than if the fight goes ahead.
I know there are people calling him greatest of all time and you always kind of rush to judge these things when you see someone so spectacular in their prime.
He recently moved his next fight from April to May due to his political responsibilities in the country.
