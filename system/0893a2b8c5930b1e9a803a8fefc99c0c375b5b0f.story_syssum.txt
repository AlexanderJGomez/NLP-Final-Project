Baton Rouge District Judge Donald Johnson ruled that investigators' records of the Memorial Medical Center deaths don't involve "criminal litigation which is either pending or which can be reasonably anticipated," so they have to be disclosed under state open records laws.
"We are glad that the Louisiana court has recognized that the investigatory file into the deaths that occurred at Memorial Medical Center in the days following Hurricane Katrina can no longer be withheld from disclosure under the public records laws," CNN said in a statement on the decision.
The case stems from allegations that several seriously ill, mostly elderly patients had been euthanized by medical staff at Memorial Hospital following the 2005 hurricane, when floodwaters rose around the hospital and conditions inside deteriorated.
But the grand jury never heard testimony from five specialists who advised Foti that the patients were deliberately killed with overdoses of drugs.
All five were brought in by Foti's office to analyze the deaths, and concluded the patients were homicide victims.
