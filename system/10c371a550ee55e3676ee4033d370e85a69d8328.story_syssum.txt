For reasons that are still not completely understood, the nerve cells in my brain and spinal cord will gradually deteriorate.
The average life expectancy is two to five years.
Although most of my mom's muscles have atrophied away, she's the longest living ALS patient in her clinic.
She is the most beautiful and inspirational person you will ever meet.
I was so incredibly exhausted, and it took my body a long time to recuperate.
I thought I was just overdoing it, but realized I couldn't ignore the symptoms anymore.
Words can't describe the level of emotional pain she went through.
I feel like I have weights strapped to my body.
I believe this is one of the reasons many people didn't really know what ALS was all about before the ice bucket challenge:  No one wanted to talk about a depressing disease with no cure, no hope.
But now ALS is finally out of the closet after the ice bucket challenge sensation this summer!
The challenge sparked hope, raised awareness and made a huge impact on launching new research initiatives, but we still need funds to find a cure.
Please join me in this fight, and I'd be so incredibly grateful.
