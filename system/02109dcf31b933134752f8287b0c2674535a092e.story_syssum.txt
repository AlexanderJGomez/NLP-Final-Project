In recent years, tourists have been flocking to Tai O to glimpse this part of Hong Kong's rapidly disappearing past.
"We are going to lose our distinctive way of life and identity if no one protests against the government plan," said lifelong Tai O resident Wang Waking, 51, who runs the Tai O culture workshop.
While the redevelopment celebrates Tai O's seafaring heritage -- in 1960, villagers caught 30% of all seafood sold in Hong Kong, according to the book "Tai O History" -- it comes in the wake of a 2012 Hong Kong law banning of commercial trawling.
Permits to drive on the town's single road are only granted to villagers and public buses.
Besides tourism, real estate development could change the fortunes of the town, as Hong Kong has one of the world's most expensive real estate markets.
But villagers do all their real estate business by word of mouth to keep outsiders out of the property market, Wong said.
She eventually moved to Kowloon, which sits across Victoria Harbor from Hong Kong Island, where she started working for a large bank.
While Wong decries the impact of tourism, many of her peers who still live in Tai O welcome the government tourism plan.
"I think Tai O has lost part of its unique character with all the development going on.
"Tai O people have deep feeling for the mountains, rivers and wetlands surrounding us, because we live so close to nature," she said.
