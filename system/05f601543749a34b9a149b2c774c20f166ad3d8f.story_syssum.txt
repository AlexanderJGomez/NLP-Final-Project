(CNN) -- As rescue efforts continue Tuesday, Colombia's president will visit the mountainside neighborhood where a massive landslide buried dozens of homes.
Officials believe the neighborhood was particularly packed Sunday afternoon -- a time when families commonly get together for meals, he said.
More than 700 people were working in shifts on search teams at the site Monday, Caracol reported.
At least 194 people have been killed and 248 injured after torrential rains throughout Colombia that have affected nearly 1.6 million people, according to the country's interior ministry.
In a few hours we will go directly to Medellin to be with the victims' families and tell them, 'Whatever the government can do to mitigate this pain and suffering, we will be there,'" Santos said in a statement Monday.
