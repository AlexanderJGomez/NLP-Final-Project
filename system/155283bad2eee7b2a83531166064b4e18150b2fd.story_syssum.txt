(CNN) -- It was Tuesday afternoon when I found a trending article through Digg that seemed to explain why I'm not reaching my full potential for joy.
The article cites a study published in the June issue of the journal Emotion, which is not to be confused with the journal Emoticon that recently sent shock waves through the tech world when it revealed that chronic overuse of smiley faces may cause dysentery.
But the common thread among both the older and younger subjects was that, regardless of age, morning people responded as being happier.
Study researcher Renee Biss, a graduate student at the University of Toronto, said one of the reasons morning people may be happier is because they tend not to suffer from social jet lag.
I did, however, find an app called Pocket UV Light and tested it out on my co-worker.
Still, I was determined to find something that could provide natural light without actually having to get up and face the outside world and/or put on pants.
For $189.95 this device delivers "the optimal 10,000 lux of therapeutic light to counteract the effects of fatigue, jet lag, and Seasonal Affective Disorder."
Unfortunately, to reap the benefits of the Optimal Light Therapy System, you have to spend 30 minutes with your face in front of a blinding, bright light.
So, for now I guess I'm just going to stay a miserable night owl.
Here comes the dysentery.
