Moreover, defendants judged to have been legally insane at the time of the offense and subsequently found not guilty by reason of insanity are in almost all cases indefinitely committed to psychiatric hospitals for treatment.
While it may seem strange to have patchwork law among the states on an apparent issue of science, according to the U.S. Supreme Court, that's exactly how it was intended to be.
This led to the development of another kind of test -- the "irresistible impulse" provision in many states, under which a defendant who can distinguish between right and wrong can still be absolved if he is still unable to stop himself from committing an act he knows to be wrong.
In Durham v. United States, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia scrapped the M'Naughten rule and the "irresistible impulse" tests and held that a defendant could not be found criminally responsible "if his unlawful act was the product of mental disease or mental defect."
As it stands today, some 46 states have an insanity defense, and 45 of those have insanity tests based on either M'Naghten or the Model Penal Code tests.
After the Hinckley backlash, four other states followed suit and abolished the defense: Utah, Kansas, Idaho and Nevada -- the latter's Supreme Court later ruled the absence of the insanity defense unconstitutional.
It may seem strange that a medical-sounding determination like insanity has different definitions from state to state.
As Justice Louis Brandeis said in New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann,  "It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory, and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country."
Not only are the states free to develop disparate law in the field of legal insanity, but under the Constitution, they are encouraged to do so.
To many, particularly in the defense bar, the availability of the defense is often academic.
