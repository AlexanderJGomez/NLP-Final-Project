Baltimore (CNN) -- Marcus Dixon refers to the tattoos on his face as the "art of war": an eye etched on his forehead, five stars down the left side of his face, and the words "don't cry" on his eyelids.
They staged an intervention and convinced him to make a fresh start.
Dixon's outlook began to change, however, when he followed his mother's advice and went to the Center for Urban Families in Baltimore.
Most men, like Dixon, walk through the center's doors because they need help finding a job.
For him, the key to creating real change in Baltimore's troubled communities is ending what he calls "the cycle of father absence."
He also knows that children who grow up without fathers are more likely to become teen parents, use drugs and commit crimes, according to the National Fatherhood Initiative.
But a counselor at the center helped Dixon arrange a plan with Child Support Services, which forgave more than $30,000 of his debt as long as he stayed employed.
Jones' program also teaches men that being a father is about more than finances.
He recently filed for visitation rights with his eldest son, who is 10 years old, and he takes his younger son, age 3, to school at least three times a week.
As a teenager, Jones became a heroin and cocaine addict and spent 17 years selling drugs and committing petty crimes to support his habit, spending time in and out of jail.
He begged a residential rehabilitation program to let him into the program, and he persuaded the judge to let him complete the one-year rehab instead of going to jail.
He found a series of nonprofit jobs and was hired by the Baltimore City Department of Health, eventually working on an initiative to improve maternal and child health.
Now married, he's raised two children with his wife and has been able to repair his relationship with his eldest son Trey.
"Joe allowed me to find and restore my dignity," he said.
