On campuses, in malls, on streets and in stadiums, Americans young and old are voicing their anger about the non-indictments in the deaths of Michael Brown and now Eric Garner in New York -- and about the rigged system that makes such results all too common.
So seeing protesters from Seattle to New York engage in civil disobedience on Black Friday was heartening.
But while the protests are promising and necessary, they are also insufficient.
Faith groups and grassroots organizers like Communities Creating Opportunity and the Organization for Black Struggle have, since this summer, been engaging people in Ferguson to organize and advocate for reforms, to register, to vote, to understand the makeup and the methods of the city council and the state legislature.
The members of the millennial generation who are driving so many of the protests today are idealistic and networked -- but also exceedingly cynical about traditional politics and government.
This is why the organization I run, Citizen University, is working with partners around the country to teach people about the skills and systems of power.
Wherever you live, ask yourself: Could I teach someone what the activists in Ferguson are teaching people now?
But what her story teaches us is this: Heroes are what happens when a moment calls forth people well prepared by institutions.
She had been groomed by an ecosystem of civil rights groups like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, trained at places like the Highlander Folk School.
That's how we can make this a season of powerful citizenship.
