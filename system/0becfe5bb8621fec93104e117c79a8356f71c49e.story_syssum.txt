"After the latest neurological test we conducted yesterday it became clear that the lack of oxygen (to) the brain of the patient caused massive damage," Dr. Wolfgang Koller told CNN affiliate SBS NL.
He was skiing outside the bounds of the ski resort with friends at the resort of Lech am Arlberg when he was hit by an avalanche, a spokesman for the state of Vorarlberg said.
He was wearing an electronic beacon that helped rescuers quickly find him.
The region's avalanche agency reported there was a considerable to great chance of avalanches in Lech last week.
