Authorities found suspect Nathaniel Brown, 51, a custodial worker, suffering from a self-inflicted gunshot at the scene, Denton said.
He was transported to the Ohio State University Medical Center, where he was dead on arrival.
About a half-dozen employees were at the building when the shooting occurred, and some witnessed it, authorities said.
The shooting comes after the university issued e-mail alerts last week about two alleged sexual assaults and an attempted assault on campus, Ohio State's student newspaper reported.
A university committee was scheduled to meet this week to determine if changes needed to be made to the notification system, The Lantern reported.
