Los Angeles (CNN) -- Last week began with a missing persons report filed for Katherine Jackson but ended with Michael Jackson's mother attending a "Unity" concert by four of her sons.
"Although I am happy my grandma was returned, after speaking with her I realized how misguided and how badly she was lied to," Prince Jackson said in bitter Twitter posting attacking his aunts and uncles.
There was a "scuffle" inside Katherine Jackson's Calabasas, California, home last Monday after Randy, Jermaine and Janet approached Michael Jackson's children in what witnesses said was an attempt to convince them to leave with them.
The e-mail was "given to the security is in compliance with Judge Beckloff's order and is not arbitrary," Schultz said.
The list of people banned from the property was prepared by estate lawyers and sent at the request of TJ Jackson after "certain members of the Jackson family showed up unannounced at the ... residence of Michael Jackson's mother and children, causing a very public disturbance," according to a statement by the estate lawyers.
"Mrs. Jackson is extremely pleased with the prospect of enjoying the pleasure of raising Michael's children without the day-to-day tedium of items such as managing the large staff that goes with such a high profile family and focus her attention on being a grandmother and raising Michael's children," Sanders said.
