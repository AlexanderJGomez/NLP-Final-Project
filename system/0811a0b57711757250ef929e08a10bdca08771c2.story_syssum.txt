"I don't think it's fair mainly because there were no violations on the field of play.
I just feel the NCAA is pimping off the Penn State situation," said my friend on the phone, a former football player and current college administrator.
He was convicted last month for sexually assaulting 10 boys over more than 10 years, while everyone, according to the Freeh report on the scandal -- coaches, administrators and Penn State's Board of Trustees, sat back and let it happen.
That is the same type of legal-loophole thinking that Joe Paterno, Mike McQueary and other top officials who knew about Sandusky's behavior used when they "followed the letter of the law" and reported to their superiors that Sandusky may have done "something" to a boy in the shower that awful night in 1998.
We are talking about a university -- not one man, many men and women, an entire culture -- that allowed a former coach to repeatedly rape and abuse boys for decades on university property and school trips.
I'm willing to believe the board of trustees also realizes we got off easy, considering how quickly it agreed not to appeal any of the NCAA sanctions.
Any board member who sat back, asked no questions or failed to demand on the record that university President Graham Spanier be more accountable to his bosses â€” that would be the board itself -- needs to step down.
If we are going to clean house in the football program -- and we are not quite done there -- then, next, every trustee who sat silent on that board since 1998 should also be asked to leave.
The trustee website also states that the board: "...has a continuing obligation to require information or answers on any university matter with which it is concerned."
Even after the board was updated about the Sandusky investigation in May 2011, several trustees recalled in the Freeh Report, no one asked tough questions.
Weak leaders put their own agenda and profits before all else.
