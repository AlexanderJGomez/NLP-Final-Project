Xin, 22, from Beijing, China, had begun her studies at Virginia Tech only two weeks before she was killed at the Au Bon Pain restaurant in the university's Graduate Life Center on January 21, school officials said.
Haiyang purchased the knife used to kill Xin the morning of her death and attempted to call her 12 times, with the first call coming just after he bought the knife, Finch said.
Haiyang said the rejection was too cruel and that Xin's fiance could not compare to him in education and background, and she should have seen he would be the best husband for her.
