"Complex diseases, such as schizophrenia, may be influenced by hundreds or thousands of genetic variants that interact with one another in complex ways," the study authors wrote in their introduction.
Past studies done on twins and families have shown that about 80% of the risk for schizophrenia is inherited, the study authors say.
In other words, if study participant Bob had Gene Cluster X, he was 70% more likely to have schizophrenia than study participant Fred who didn't have that cluster of genes.
"In the past, scientists had been looking for associations between individual genes and schizophrenia," co-author Dr. Dragan Svrakic said in the statement.
There are only so many ways that certain malfunctions in your genetic code can manifest, Raison says.
Two reasons, Raison says: to help predict who might get schizophrenia, and to help treat it more efficiently.
If you have a drug that treats pneumonia, it's going to help only a certain percentage of patients with pleurisy.
