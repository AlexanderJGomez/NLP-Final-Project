And they have their own sports show, one that offers an alternative to the "testosterone ceiling" of the guys' club.
"Ladies in the locker room are not women who think they know everything about sports; they just know the men who do," Lemon said.
And for the second time in the show's history, Lemon is traveling to the Super Bowl with a handful of her ladies and a production crew to create a version of the show featuring interviews with the celebrities and stars flocking to football's big game.
Soma Balber, a self-professed superfan of the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team and one of the show's commentators for the 2008-09 season, first got to know Lemon when she began playing a recurring role in "Atlanta Homicide."
As for men who have never played sports but still know all the stats?
I just hope we get more women talking about sports."
