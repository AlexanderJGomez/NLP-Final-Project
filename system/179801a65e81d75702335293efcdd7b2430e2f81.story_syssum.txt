Officer Ben Tobias announced that the Gainesville police department charged Pedro Bravo with the death of Christian Aguilar.
Police told Aguilar's family about the murder charge -- and, with it, the presumption the college student was dead -- about an hour before the public announcement, Tobias said.
Bravo then left Aguilar in a parking lot in the central Florida city, prompting police to warn that Aguilar may be disoriented and/or seriously injured.
Gainesville police posted a fresh plea Friday night, on the department's Facebook page, asking volunteers to report to the Florida Farm Bureau at 9 a.m. Saturday to resume the search for Aguilar.
At that time, a judge will assess the case and set bail for Bravo or decline to, thus assuring that the suspect will remain in custody.
