A truck driver sees a vehicle that the suspected kidnapper is driving and calls police, who find the kids inside, under blankets and pillows.
Police get a call from a resident because the suspect's car has been parked on a nearby street all night.
And though these cases didn't get the same national attention as the search for San Diego teenager Hannah Anderson, they are among hundreds that demonstrate why the program is critical to saving children's lives, said Robert Hoever, a director of special operations for the center.
Of the 2,064 children who were the focus of Amber Alerts between 2005 and 2012 (the years for which the center has complete figures on the number of alerts) 394 were rescued.
"You had the combination of a new technology, with very careful moves by investigators to broaden the sending of the Amber Alerts as new leads came in."
The children's father, who gave television interviews in the hope of keeping his daughter's case in the spotlight, would later describe DiMaggio as a onetime family friend.
The teenager's abduction was the first time the new, federally administered Wireless Emergency Alerts program was issued statewide, California Highway Patrol spokesman Erin Komatsubara told HLN.
The teenager and the man were inappropriately dressed for the wilderness and their tent was pitched on a mountain like someone inexperienced in camping might do.
The riders contacted Idaho State Police, and their tip over the weekend sent FBI agents swarming to the camping spot outside Cascade, in central Idaho.
Four days later, Hagerman's body was found in a creek eight miles from her home, according to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.
The first success of the program came after a November 1998 kidnapping, Hoever said.
The police tracked down the vehicle and rescued the baby.
