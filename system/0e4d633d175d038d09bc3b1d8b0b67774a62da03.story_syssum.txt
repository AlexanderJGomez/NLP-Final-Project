"We've put a lot of effort into Android Market's rating system, which now works well globally," Google spokesman Christopher Katsaros said in a statement.
The CTIA's guidelines aim to score smartphone and tablet apps on a five-point scale based on their violence and sexual content.
The ratings, which would be controlled by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (which also controls computer and videogame maturity ratings) would range from "Everyone" to "Adults Only."
Apps would receive their rating almost instantaneously, and if a developer disagreed with the assigned rating, it could appeal it.
