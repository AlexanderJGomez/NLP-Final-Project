Tragically, some of the protests turned violent and took the lives of Americans, Libyans, Tunisians and Yemenis.
As things become clearer, it seems that the video was created and promoted by members of the American Coptic Christian community -- a community with its roots in Egypt.
It also said that the video does not in any way represent the view of the Coptic community.
Virtually no Coptic Christian I encountered had heard of him before.
From the local representatives of Muslim communities in America, to the religious establishments of Egypt and Libya, to the leadership of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, which represents all Muslim countries, we have heard apologies and condemnations for the violence.
It should be those who have been directly fanning the flames of intolerance not just over the last few months, but over the years.
Similarly, there are those within the Muslim Arab world who also push for a hateful agenda, to devastating effect.
The least we can do now is to make sure not to blame the wrong people for the vile actions of a few individuals.
