Reno, Nevada (CNN) -- A man who once appeared discreetly as a stunt pilot in movies became the center of national attention after a crash at a Nevada air show.
"The vision was to have a variety of great airplanes, a variety of great pilots," Leeward said in a documentary about his ranch.
Some witnesses are crediting him with using his flying skills to help limit the number of people injured.
"I think he was trying to do whatever he could right up to the end," said Fred Scholz, a witness.
He had been part of the Reno air race since 1975, said Mike Houghton, president of the Reno Air Racing Association.
Great family man."
