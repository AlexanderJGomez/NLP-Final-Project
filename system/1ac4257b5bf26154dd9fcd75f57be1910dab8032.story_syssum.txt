His concerns over the dangers of a possible nuclear reactor so close to his ranch have increased since the nuclear disaster triggered by last week's quake and tsunami in Japan, he said.

The situation in Japan doesn't seem to have any effect on those who steadfastly support the proposed nuclear plant near Victoria, Pozzi said.
"My support hasn't wavered at all," he said.
Blackburn and his Texans for Sound Energy Policy group fears the ground beneath the proposed nuclear site could sink, causing the cooling water ponds, vital to a nuclear plant, to drain away.
A study of the area shows one growth fault in the area moved only 8 inches over 40 years.
