This makes Milke only the second woman exonerated from death row in the United States.
The two men with whom Milke was accused of conspiring were tried separately and are still on death row.
And during her trial, prosecutors floated a likely motive: A $5,000 life insurance policy she had taken out on the child.
No other witnesses or direct evidence linked Milke to the crime other than Saldate's testimony.
Saldate had been suspended five days for taking "liberties" with a female motorist and lying about it to his supervisors.
"The state knew of the evidence in the personnel file and had an obligation to produce the documents," Kozinski said.
Milke was released on bail, and the court said she couldn't be tried again.
And Milke left the court room, sobbing in relief.
