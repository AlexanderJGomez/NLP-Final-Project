One hundred and sixty years of searching -- one attempt as recent as last month -- have failed to find "HMS Erebus" and her sister ship, the somewhat appropriately named "HMS Terror" -- the two vessels lost in the Arctic.
"We love adventure stories, of derring-do, win against all odds, but in this story they don't and we still don't know why."
Despite the ships being reinforced with steel and holding three years worth or provisions, it appears the environment got the better of the crew.
The disappearance of the Erebus and the Terror has prompted the longest search mission in history: Although there have been numerous attempts to find the ships, there has been no sign of them.
The tale of the Franklin expedition has enthralled Canadians -- the wreckage has the dubious honor of being the only national historic site in Canada that hasn't been found yet.
A rock cairn with a message on it indicated that the harsh conditions had already claimed their first lives, with only 105 men left alive.
That same year the men abandoned their ships, archaeologists believing they began making their way south in a desperate bid to find food.
Based on their accounts it is thought some of the men lived for another three or four years after abandoning ship.
His theory is that the men succumbed to lead poisoning derived from the internal pipe system used to melt ice into drinking water.
Parks Canada insists that their searches have not been futile and they'll continue to gather information to help with future efforts.
