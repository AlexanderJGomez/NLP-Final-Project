(CNN) -- The FBI's Ten Most Wanted list now includes a man suspected of killing a young New York mother and her toddler son execution-style in 2010.
The FBI said that under the guise of an invitation to dinner in Central Islip, New York, Garcia coerced Argueta and her 2-year-old son into the woods.
He was 17 and answered to the nickname "Cruzito" at the time of the slayings on February 4, 2010.
The FBI requests that anyone with information on Garcia contact its New York Field Office at 212-384-1000, a nearby law enforcement agency or U.S. Embassy or Consulate.
