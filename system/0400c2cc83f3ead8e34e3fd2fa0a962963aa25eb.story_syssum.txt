That's quite a change for a woman who tipped the scales eight years ago at 295 pounds.
At first, Wygal was shocked and refused to begin a diet that she thought was too restrictive.
She started by keeping track of her daily calorie intake in a food diary and soon realized that her eating was worse than she thought.
At first, Wygal says, she was too embarrassed to go to a gym, so she bought an elliptical machine and started working out 15 minutes a day in her apartment.
Several months later, Wygal was ready to take the next step.
Instead of feeling intimidated, Wygal started to love her workouts and the physical changes taking shape with her body.
Now comfortable with her weight, which she says fluctuates between 170 and 180 pounds, Wygal works out at least five to six days a week.
