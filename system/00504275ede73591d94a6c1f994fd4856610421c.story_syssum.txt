(Mother Nature Network) -- Mother's Day poems come in all shapes and sizes.
If nothing else, the poet almost always acknowledges the significant role a mother plays in the lives of her children.
Ginsberg, one of the leading voices of the Beat Generation, wrote this lengthy poem following the 1956 death of his mother.
Wakoski, a contemporary poet who counts Allen Ginsberg among her influences, writes of the "beauty that can come from even an ugly past" in this poem that recounts, among other things, the financial struggles her mother accepted in order to make sure she could pay for her child's piano lessons.
If I were drowned in the deepest sea, Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine!
This lesser-known piece by the Harlem Renaissance writer takes the perspective of the mother speaking to her son and telling him that "Life for me ain't been no crystal stair."
