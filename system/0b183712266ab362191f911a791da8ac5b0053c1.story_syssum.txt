JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- Israeli officials are seeking a meeting with Turkey's ambassador to protest a show on Turkish television that reportedly depicts Israeli soldiers murdering Palestinian children.
"Such a series which bears no connection whatsoever to reality, presenting IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers as murderers of innocent children, should not be broadcast even in hostile states -- and certainly not in a state that maintains full diplomatic relations with Israel," Lieberman said.
The official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly, said U.S. officials were uncomfortable about excluding Israel and so welcomed postponing the maneuvers in which U.S. military units were scheduled to participate.
Kiniklioglu said it "would not be wrong to say Turkish-Israeli relations have become much more fragile" after Gaza, commenting on the exclusion of Israel from military exercises.
Alon Liel, Israel's top diplomat in Turkey during the 1980s, said he believes the relations between the two countries are in crisis.
