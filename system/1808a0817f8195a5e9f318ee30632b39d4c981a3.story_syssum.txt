With Hawaii and Delaware joining the list Sunday, five states now recognize same-sex civil unions, while six other states and Washington, D.C., allow same-sex marriage, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Marriage licenses are given to same-sex couples in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York and the District of Columbia, the NCSL says.
"It means that our state supports us, and that's a really good feeling after all this time," Montgomery said at the ceremony.
"We need you to mount a campaign to flood the governor's office with requests to veto the bill," Larry Silva, Catholic bishop of Honolulu, wrote on the Diocese of Honolulu's website at the time.
"Civil unions are a desperate and dishonest attempt to force same-sex 'marriage' on Hawaii," the group said.
"You can't really talk about civil unions without talking about same-sex 'marriage' because there really isn't any difference," the group argued.
The greater good is served when we speak out and fight hard when we see that bias, prejudice or even outdated laws attempt to lessen any one of us."
