Ayalon singled out the remarks of a Catholic archbishop who said at the conference that Israel is not the Jews' promised land.
"We call on the Vatican to distant themselves from Archbishop Boutros' comments which are a libel against the Jewish People and the State of Israel and should not be construed as the Vatican's official position," Ayalon said in his statement.
"Israel cannot use the biblical concept of a promised land or chosen people to justify new settlements in Jerusalem or Israeli territorial claims," Saeb Erakat, a spokesman for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and a chief palestinian negotiator, said in a statement Sunday.
At the time, he assured Palestinians of the Vatican's support of a sovereign Palestinian homeland.
More recently, the issue of settlement construction has threatened to scuttle the reactivated and now stalled peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians.
