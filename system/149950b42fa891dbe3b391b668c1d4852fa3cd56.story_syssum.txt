In a career spanning 26 years, she was the first Asian opera singer to achieve worldwide success and has won accolades and fans all over the world, from a Grammy award to being elected a UNESCO Artist for Peace.
At the age of 19, she traveled alone half way round the world from her native South Korea to Italy to kick start her career in the home of opera, and has been traveling ever since.
Today she owns three beloved dogs and is involved with an animal rights charity in South Korea.
Jo says she was destined to be an opera singer before she was even born, as her mother had dreamed of being a singer herself and had been thwarted by political upheaval.
"She was born during the Japanese occupation and then she went through the Korean War," Jo says.
"For my case probably it worked because, thank god, I had to the talent.
"My mother told me by phone she said, 'You should stay there to sing for your public because for me you are not a simple a daughter for me.
At the age of 49, Jo is still working to achieve the balance between work and home life that she craves.
Sometimes I see myself sad and lonely, but I think I deserve to be more happy.
