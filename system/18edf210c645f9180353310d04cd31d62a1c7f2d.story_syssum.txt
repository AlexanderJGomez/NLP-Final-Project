If you spend all your time in a web browser and don't want to spend much on a typical computer, a Chromebook would be worth a closer look.
For starters, while many other cheap Chromebooks feature so-so screens, HP's model sports a nice-ish IPS (in-plane switching) screen for better viewing angles and more vivid color reproduction.
Design-wise, the HP Chromebook 11 sports similar internal specs to an earlier $250 Samsung model; both feature a mobile processor more commonly found in smartphones and tablets than portable computers.
That's the one I'm most interested in for use a mobile reporting computer.
