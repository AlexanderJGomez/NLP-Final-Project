An unlicensed doctor has been charged with causing an HIV outbreak in a remote village in northwestern Battambang province, local media report.
"After questioning Yem Chroeum, he confessed he did order his son-in-law to burn down the evidence behind his house, and (treated) patients with negligence, as well as using the same needles to treat them," Chet Vanny, deputy police chief of Battambang province told the Phnom Penh Post.
Prime Minister Hun Sen announced last week that Cambodia is committed to stopping new HIV infections by 2020.
The government will allocate US$3.7 million of national funding to HIV treatment from 2015 to 2017.
