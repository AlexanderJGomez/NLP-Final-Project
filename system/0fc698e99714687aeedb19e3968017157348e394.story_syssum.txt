Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Hours after voting ended in Indonesia's presidential race, candidate Joko "Jokowi" Widodo proclaimed victory while his rival Prabowo Subianto urged patience as the official vote count proceeded.
For his supporters, the "Jokowi effect" heralds a new breed of political leaders -- a break from Indonesia's tradition of leaders with military, bureaucratic or elite backgrounds.
Prabowo, a former son-in-law of Indonesian president Suharto, has sought to project an image as a take-charge leader.
Millions of Indonesian voters cast their paper ballots Wednesday.
The next president needs to "make a strong push to rein in corruption that plagues Indonesia's economy and make it a suitable place for domestic and international investments," said Pepinsky.
