A protest against racism and police violence packed sidewalks in New York on Tuesday, despite calls from the city's mayor for a pause in demonstrations.
But organizers of Tuesday's protest said there was no reason to "give in to hysteria" and call off the march.
"Please embrace those around you as a symbol of our belief that we will move forward together," he said after marking the moment when two officers were shot in an ambush.
De Blasio and his wife were among the mourners who stopped Tuesday by a memorial at the site where the officers were killed, looking at flowers and an American flag hanging on the wall of a building.
The gunman who killed the officers ignored their message and "took it upon himself to take negative actions," she said.
De Blasio has come under fire since the shooting, facing criticism that he's fanned tensions between the public and police.
Since Saturday's shooting, critics have taken aim at de Blasio's earlier comments supporting protesters who've voiced their concerns about the case of Garner, a 43-year-old who died in July after police in Staten Island placed him in what appeared to be a chokehold.
Brinsley, who ranted against the government and law enforcement on social media, ambushed and shot to death Ramos and Liu as they sat in their patrol car at about 2:45 p.m. Saturday in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant.
Police have said Brinsley started his day in Baltimore, where he shot and seriously wounded his ex-girlfriend at her apartment in the early morning and then took a Bolt bus to New York.
