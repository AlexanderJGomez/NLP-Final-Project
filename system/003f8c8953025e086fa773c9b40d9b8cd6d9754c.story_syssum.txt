WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A former middle-school student who was strip-searched by school officials looking for ibuprofen pain medication won a partial victory of her Supreme Court appeal Thursday in a case testing the discretion of officials to ensure classroom safety.
"Savana's subjective expectation of privacy against such a search is inherent in her account of it as embarrassing, frightening and humiliating," wrote Justice David Souter for the majority, likely his last opinion before he steps down from the bench next week.
Redding was pulled from class by Vice Principal Kerry Wilson, escorted to an office and confronted with the evidence.
Redding was ordered to strip to her underwear and to pull on the elastic of the underwear, so any hidden pills might fall out, according to court records.
With the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, Redding and her family sued, and a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled against the school, calling the search "traumatizing" and illegal.
"Wilson's treatment of Redding was abusive, and it was not reasonable for him to believe that the law permitted it," said Ginsburg, who was especially forceful during oral arguments in April, criticizing the school's actions.
"Preservation of order, discipline and safety in public schools is simply not the domain of the Constitution," he said.
The court was being asked to clarify the extent of student rights involving searches and the discretion of officials regarding those they have responsibility over.
"Before it happened, I loved school, loved everything about it.
The case is Safford Unified School District No.
