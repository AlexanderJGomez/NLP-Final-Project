If party moderates break from the GOP leadership on these issues, it dramatically increases Kagan's chances of overcoming a possible filibuster and winning confirmation as the country's 112th Supreme Court justice.
"It was the first question I actually asked her because, having been in the military, I had concerns about [her] position at Harvard," Brown said.
She also said she didn't see any "extraordinary circumstances" that could lead her to join a potential filibuster against Kagan.
In addition to meeting with Brown and Collins on Thursday, Kagan stopped by the offices of five key Senate Democrats: Massachusetts' John Kerry, New York's Chuck Schumer, Maryland's Ben Cardin, Minnesota's Amy Klobuchar and Pennsylvania's Arlen Specter.
Specter is a staunch advocate of allowing television cameras into the high court.
Some political observers have speculated that his previous opposition to Kagan, combined with an unwillingness to immediately back her now, could undercut his support with stalwart Democrats.
If confirmed, she would become the third woman on the current nine-member bench and the fourth woman in the court's history.
