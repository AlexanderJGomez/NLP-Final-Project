For the launch of the flagship FEI World Cup Finals in Lyon, France the organizing body assembled the finest talent from the worlds of elite riding and ballet to show off their skills side by side.
Double Olympic gold medalist Charlotte Dujardin was just as impressed with her partnership with Belarusian maestro Kanstantsin Geronik -- calling it an "exciting" prelude to the competition in which she once again shattered world records.
He called Dujardin "a full-blown artist herself" but says seeing her perform alongside Geronik highlighted the virtuosos' similarities.
Dujardin, the World number one Dressage rider, who took the dressage crown in Lyon, has been labeled "the girl with the dancing horse," but was enthused to see her horse-less dancing counterparts in action.
