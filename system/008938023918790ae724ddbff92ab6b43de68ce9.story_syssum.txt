All of the bodies and body parts recovered from the crash site will eventually be brought to Hilversum, Netherlands, where a team of experts from the Dutch national forensics unit (Landelijk Team Forensische Opsporing) will do everything they can to return the dead to their loved ones.
Van Roo says great care has and will continue to be taken over the bodies, out of respect for the victims and to avoid any further distress to their families.
The team's work began days ago on the Ukrainian field near the Russian border where MH17's journey from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur came to a premature end.

"The longer it goes on, the more difficult it can be.

"Every case is unique, [but] you want to get the victim back.
