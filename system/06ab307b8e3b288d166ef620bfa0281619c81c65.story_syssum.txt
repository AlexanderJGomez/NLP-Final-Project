Or was, until about 2:50 p.m., when explosions near the finish line of the Boston Marathon transformed a celebration into a scene of carnage.
In a city and a region obsessed with tradition, you couldn't ask for more than the oldest marathon in the country coinciding with patriotic re-enactments of colonials versus redcoats, all playing out against the backdrop of the budding spring.
To complete the celebration, Patriots Day marks the annual 11 a.m. Red Sox game at Fenway Park, an utterly local tradition concocted so baseball crowds wouldn't get in the way of marathon crowds.
These days, it's more of a pure spectacle, and I doubt many of those watching could name even one of the East African runners who have won in recent years.
We all know people who were running in it, and perhaps we donated to the charitable cause they had registered with so they could gain entry.
I am not privy to what sort of security arrangements go into planning the Boston Marathon, but there's only so much you can do along a 26.2-mile route that passes through seven cities and towns in addition to Boston.
"Boston is a tough and resilient town," President Obama said in his White House remarks Monday evening.
