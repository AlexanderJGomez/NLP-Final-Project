The captain and many of the troops stayed on the ship until the last, perishing in the ocean as the women and children made their way to safety.
Lee Joon-seok of the Sewol, the South Korean ferry that sunk last week, has come under heavy criticism for abandoning the ship while hundreds of passengers remained on board.
Witnesses said Schettino jumped into a lifeboat to flee the ship, even though hundreds of passengers were still on board.
The cases of the Sewol and the Costa Concordia have raised questions about a captain's obligations to passengers when a vessel runs into trouble.
An international maritime convention on the safety of life at sea makes a captain responsible for the vessel and all the people on board, but it doesn't stipulate that the captain stay on the ship throughout the crisis.
"He's got to be there and take care of that," Courtley told CNN.
Schettino and Lee are not alone in leaving a doomed ship before their passengers, though.
"The captain should have been passing honest and clear information on to everyone as to the situation, not telling them to just sit," said William Doherty, a retired captain with the U.S.
At the same time, the rescue ship did not come, and there were no fishing boats or supporting ships around to help at that time."
Although U.S. law doesn't specify abandoning ship as a crime, it's a long-standing tradition that the captain be the last one off a sinking ship, according to legal experts.
He cautioned, though, that not all the details have emerged of Lee's actions during the crucial moments on the Sewol.
Lee appears to have been confident of his ability to ensure the safety of passengers in the past.
