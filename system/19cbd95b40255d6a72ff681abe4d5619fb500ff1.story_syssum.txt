LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- With foreclosures and bankruptcy affecting millions of homeowners, CNN's Larry King on Tuesday talked to several experts in the real estate industry to get advice on handling the mortgage meltdown.
If you go out to your own marketplace and intentionally under-price your home 20 percent to 25 percent less than you think it's worth, or that a credible appraiser tells you it's worth, you will sell that house within the week.
Michael Corbett: The biggest mistake right now is when you get that default notice, you ignore it.
The first thing they should do when they get those notices is contact either the lender or go to HUD [the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development].
Caller: I have a loan with Countrywide, and they will not refinance our interest-only loan, because they say our debt-to-income ratio is too high, and their workout department won't even look at us because we've never been behind on our mortgage and we're not currently behind.
Their loss mitigation or their workout department, they don't want to help you until you're two months or three months in debt.
But by law, they have to answer certified mail, and a lot of people don't use it.
Could I refinance it to get a better interest rate, or should I try to negotiate with the mortgage company to adjust the payment?"
I think one of the biggest problems, nevertheless, is that a lot of people borrowed on variable rate interests when they had mortgages at 1 and 2 percent that grew up over time.
King: We have an e-mail question from Debbie in Orlando, Florida: "What's a family to do if they lose their home to foreclosure?
You don't really need the money because it's already financed.
I recommend now is the time to buy.
It's not like they are putting in new money.
They want somebody to live in that house.
But if you're not -- if you don't learn from the experience and you think the government is going to bail you out, then you've wasted a big opportunity to learn something.
