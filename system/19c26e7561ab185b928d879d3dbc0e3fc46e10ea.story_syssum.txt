His time away from the Oval Office included the month leading up to 9/11, when there were signs Osama bin Laden was planning to attack America, and the time Hurricane Katrina destroyed the city of New Orleans.
When he was invited last spring to attend a discussion of the role of faith in his life with Sens.
Great scholars have wrestled with the meaning of faith for centuries.
While saying it was his greatest moral failing, he offered nothing in the way of explanation.
Surely he has some thoughts on what it all means that go beyond canned answers culled from the same speech he delivers every day.

Where are John McCain's writings exploring the vexing moral issues of our time?
And it shows over and over again whenever McCain is called upon to think on his feet.

He will leave office with the country $10 trillion in debt, fighting two wars, our international reputation in shambles, our government cloaked in secrecy and suspicion that his entire presidency has been a litany of broken laws and promises, our citizens' faith in our own country ripped to shreds.
