It was heartbreaking for the athlete to sit on the bench after all the health problems she had already battled during her journey to London.
Symptoms can flare up at any time, and although the disease is somewhat controlled with medication, it is a lifelong problem.
We caught up with Boxx after the London Games to talk about her diagnosis and how she deals with it as an elite athlete.
I have to regularly use eye drops, drink lots of water and get regular checkups for both my eyes and my teeth.
I am very fortunate that I have finally found a medicine that helps control my symptoms, but a few years ago that wasn't the case.
On the positive side, it has made me so much stronger as a person and as an athlete.
To help with joint pain, I wear compression pants to sleep in and I have also been able to tweak our lifting routine so that I don't have to put as much pressure on my joints.
I think it's important that you have someone who understands that you can feel good a majority of the time but are there for you when a flare-up happens.
I haven't let this disease stop me from doing the sport that I love.
If I can help spread the word about what lupus or Sjogren's is and what the symptoms are, maybe I can help get people in to visit a doctor sooner.
Do I push through and maybe do more damage to my leg and maybe hurt the team in the process, 'cause I'm not 100% (and in the worst case scenario, be out for the rest of the tournament): or do I take myself out and give our team the chance with a healthy body in there?
I chose the second, and even though it was hard sitting on the bench I knew I put the team first.
