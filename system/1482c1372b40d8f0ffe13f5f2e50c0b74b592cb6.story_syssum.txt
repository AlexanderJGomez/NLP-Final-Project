Health officials said a fifth person died and 10 others wounded in eastern Nangarhar province.
The materials were gathered for disposal and were inadvertently given to troops for burning, Gen. John Allen, commander of NATO's International Security Assistance Force, said Tuesday.
Protesters burned tires and threw rocks outside Camp Phoenix, close to the Kabul International Airport, the U.S. Embassy said in its official Twitter feed.
Jacobson said protesters tried to penetrate the facility, prompting NATO helicopter to launch flares and authorities to fire rubber bullets to disperse the crowds.
Allen, the coalition commander, offered his apologies Tuesday and issued a directive that all coalition forces in Afghanistan will undergo training no later than March 3 so they can identify religious materials and handle them correctly.
Carter also met with Afghan Defense Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak and several Afghan parliamentarians, offered his apologies to them and "pledged his full support for a joint Afghan-ISAF investigation into the incident," Pentagon spokesman Capt.
A photographer for Agence France-Presse said Afghans who work inside the airfield told him they obtained the Qurans there.
Last year, when controversial Florida pastor Terry Jones presided over what he called a trial of the Quran and burned a copy, Afghans took to the streets by the thousands.
But coalition forces said the suspected burning was a routine burn-pit session in which military documents are destroyed.
"What is captured on the pages can be printed again.
I would rather they burn 100 Qurans than to hurt one woman or man or child."
