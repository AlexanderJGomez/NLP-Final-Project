On Wednesday, the shoplifter made amends with a $50 bill and a thank you letter for saving him from a life of crime.
According to Sohail, the man immediately started to plead with him, tearfully saying, "I'm sorry, I have no food.
Sohail, who is from Pakistan, said the man then wanted to be a Muslim like him, so he recited an Islamic oath and gave the would-be robber the name Nawaz Sharif Zardari.
Sohail went to get some milk, but when he returned the man had fled with the money and food.
"No person has ever moved my spirit the way you did.
He has made a point to give this money "to the people" by offering free bagels, rolls and coffee in his store every night after 9 o'clock.
The letter says Sohail's acts inspired him to become a "True Muslim" and that his life has changed dramatically.
So now he is a good person in this community and I'm very glad for that.
