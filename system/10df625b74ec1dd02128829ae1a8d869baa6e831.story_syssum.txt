(CNN) -- A property dispute between family members apparently led to a shooting in which a man killed two people in the central Virginia town of Louisa before he was shot by police, authorities said.
The incident began when deputies responded to a report of an argument at the home, police said.
The man then directed his gunfire at police and released a pit bull terrier on them, authorities said.
The four wounded people were taken to the University of Virginia Hospital in Charlottesville, Molnar said.
