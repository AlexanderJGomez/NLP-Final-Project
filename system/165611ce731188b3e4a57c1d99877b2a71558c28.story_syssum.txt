Known as "poshstock," especially since British Prime Minister David Cameron was spotted there this year (albeit apparently hiding behind a pair of fake Ray-Ban sunglasses), the festival places great emphasis on comfort.
Among performance highlights at this year's "intimate, bespoke banquet of music, arts and culture," to quote the giddy festival organizers again, are the Brythoniaid Male Voice Choir, travel writer Jan Morris and harpist Georgia Ruth.
Singers might hit the high notes but you shouldn't get carried away by all the extravagant emotion depicted in the opera performances -- the prevailing mood here is genteel, just in the way it isn't at, say, the Bloodstock Open Air heavy metal festival in Derbyshire, UK.
Everything is resolutely local, seasonal, "artisan" and Fairtrade, from the tea and cakes from the Deliciousness Tea Shop, to the Full of Beans coffee and the really rather annoyingly titled Boogie Breakfasts.
The festival venue is a historic Oslo park containing the ruins of a medieval church.
The pop-up onsite restaurant Maison Bru serves food by the eponymous Michelin-starred Belgian chef Wout Bru; there's a festival bakery; and gluten-free food can be ordered in advance for those sensitive types.
This posh Oxfordshire bash completes the Henley Royal Regatta every year, a rowing race whose entrants and spectators share a good concentration of blue blood.
The word "twee" inevitably suggests itself when describing this festival of music and the arts set in and around yet another stately home.
A sample of the non-headbanging performances on show include the poet Luke Wright, gentle satirist of yummy mummies and inbred aristocratic politicians, and a capella versions of pop songs from the 50 Degrees Choir.
