Policemen inspect the area after a van loaded with a bomb exploded in northeast Madrid.
The attack came just hours after Spain's Supreme Court declined to allow two new leftist Basque parties to compete in the March 1 Basque regional elections in northern Spain.
"What ETA did this morning ratifies the Supreme Court decision last night," Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba told reporters, at the scene of the explosion.
ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its long fight for Basque independence.
