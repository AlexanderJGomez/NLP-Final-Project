And a new poll released this week finds Obama with his lowest approval rating -- and his highest disapproval rating -- ever.
Well, the good news for Obama is that the script for the final scenes of his presidency has not been written yet.
Obama's main antagonist, of course, is the hyper-partisan Congress that refuses to agree on the most basic issues, such as raising the debt ceiling, which Congress has done more than 40 times since 1980.
Though the government shutdown had been an unwelcome setback, polls showed after it ended that Americans blamed the Republicans in Congress for it much more than they blamed him.
The rain has stopped, the ocean is turning calm and there is even a glimmer of sunlight; he's beaten the storm.
This may be exciting to watch, but not great for the character, who has no idea what will happen next.
Can the President maneuver through this new landscape and turn it to his advantage?
Even getting more moderate Republicans into the House could be a step toward sanity.
It's denouement time for Obama as we enter the final act of his presidency.
