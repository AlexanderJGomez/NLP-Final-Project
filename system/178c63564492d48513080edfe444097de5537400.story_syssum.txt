John Crawford III was black, and his family's lawyers Tuesday mentioned Eric Garner, Tamir Rice and Michael Brown as they announced the suit -- evoking cases that have stirred international outrage because the three also were black and killed by police officers.
"We believe that had Mr. Crawford been white, he may have gotten a little bit more time to respond to the police officers," he said.
Walmart spokesman Brian Nick expressed condolences to Crawford's family and to relatives of a mother who fled the scene of the police shooting with her daughter, had a heart attack and later died.
"Out of respect for everyone involved, we believe it's not appropriate to discuss the specifics of this matter, but we can say that our associates acted properly.
"We acknowledge the family's right to bring this action and are confident the trial will be fair and impartial.
"Mr. Crawford never used, loaded or pointed the pellet rifle at anyone, was doing nothing improper or illegal, and never caused any harm or acted in a manner that would cause any reasonable person to believe that he may cause harm," the suit said.
The family alleges, among other things, that the police officers did not use due diligence to determine that Wright wasn't a threat; that the officers didn't give him enough time to put down the weapon; and that Walmart was negligent because the air rifle had been resting on a shelf, unpackaged and unsecured, for at least two days, the family's lawyers said Tuesday.
Crawford was the father of a baby son, Jayden, born last March, the suit said.
