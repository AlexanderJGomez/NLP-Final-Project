(CNN) -- Years after his death, baseball legend Honus Wagner hit a home run for a group of nuns, who will use proceeds from the sale of his extremely rare baseball card to do charitable work.
Like other stars of the early 20th century, Wagner, a Hall of Famer with the Pittsburgh Pirates, appeared on tobacco company cards.
Never mind that the card's sides had been trimmed to fit in a scrapbook, that it was laminated and lost some paper on the back, leaving it in poor condition.
He plans to have the card make the rounds of the company's stores in Tennessee, Florida and South Carolina.
About 75 percent of his pursuit of the T206 card was emotion, he said.
