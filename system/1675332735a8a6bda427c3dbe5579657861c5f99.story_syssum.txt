It happened as the two planes were flying close by as the skydivers prepared to jump in formation, Superior Fire Department Battalion Chief Vern Johnson told CNN.
The plane caught fire and broke up in midair, but the skydivers and the pilot all parachuted to safety.
The pilot of the trailing plane landed safely and picked up the pilot of the crashed aircraft along the runway as he taxied in, Johnson said.
"The jumpers and pilots have been through a very surreal experience, and they are lucky and thankful to be alive," it said.
