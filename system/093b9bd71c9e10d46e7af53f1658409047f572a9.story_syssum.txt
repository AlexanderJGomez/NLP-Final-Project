The pummeling of the Brazilian team on home turf was the most-discussed single sports game ever on the social media network with 35.6 million tweets.
Some lamented the lack of Brazilian superstar Neymar, who was out with a fractured vertebra sustained in the previous game against Colombia.

They will face the winners of Wednesday's other semi-final clash between Argentina and the Netherlands.
