A substance initially suspected to be tar heroin proved not to be a narcotic, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation.
That document also revealed that toxicology tests led the Los Angeles County coroner to a preliminary conclusion that Jackson died of an overdose of propofol, a powerful sedative he had been given to help him sleep.
A source with knowledge of the probe told CNN Thursday that a test later showed that a brown, sticky substance found in the search was not heroin.
The coroner announced two weeks ago that the report on Jackson's death was completed, but that police asked for it to be withheld until completion of the criminal probe.
