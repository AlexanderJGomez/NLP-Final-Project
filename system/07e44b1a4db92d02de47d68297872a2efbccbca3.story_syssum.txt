When a campaign doesn't go my way, I always take a step back, look at the facts and try to figure out what we could learn from that experience.
In the past decade, Congressman Bill Young won his seat by anywhere from 15% to 38%.
By a strong majority, Independents sided with the Democrat who was committed to fixing and improving Obamacare over the Republican who wants to repeal it.
In this race outside Republican groups dumped in $5 million to squeak out a win in a district they carried by 15% in 2012.
Money might have been a factor, but third party groups aligned with Democrats also poured in money to help get out the vote.
This was the same theme, as progressive activist Dave Johnson pointed out, that shifted the 2010 election to Republicans, and it helped again.
But the "be afraid" message works well for Republicans, in part because the Democrats don't counter it.
Let's face it, more Republican voters filed and submitted absentee ballots than Democrats, and more turned out on Election Day.
In this week's election, turnout was lower than it was in the 2010 midterm elections, and much lower than it was in the 2012 presidential race.
While we learned important lessons that will help us win in November, we won't fret over this loss too much.
That was true before Election Day, and it's true today.
