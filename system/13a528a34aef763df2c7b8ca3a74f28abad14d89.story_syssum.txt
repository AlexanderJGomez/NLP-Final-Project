It's the only place of its kind, on its scale, anywhere in the world.
The media are rarely allowed inside, in an effort to minimize the disruption of the residents' daily lives, but we were granted access in late March.
As things stand now, people with dementia are largely ignored.
Here are 5 things I learned on the inside.
Yvonne van Amerongen, one of Hogewey's founders, told me even the residents who make it to this door aren't necessarily trying to leave.
To that end, there are other safety modifications in place.
The words and lyrics are activated on the left side of the brain in the language areas, while the tune and melody are more right brained.
"We can't talk anymore about everything, but with singing... you can make a good concert together," Ada said.
The toughest conversation I had while at Hogewey was with a resident named Jo Verhoef.
I asked resident social worker Marjolein de Visser about her strategy when it comes to correcting confusion like this.
she told me.
One of the most productive things you can do to help keep a person with dementia from feeling lost, frightened, or agitated is to help them live as familiar a life as possible.
She told me when the residents simply get their hair combed, it has a calming effect.
I spent the majority of my time at Hogewey with two couples, Ada and Ben Picavet, as well as Corrie and Theo Visser.
Theo told me his marriage is the best it's been in nearly 60 years.
