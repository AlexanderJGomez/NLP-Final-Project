Goodman asked her friends where they planned to go this year for their summer vacation.
They're afraid to take vacations, but at the same time, they need them more than ever."
Americans had a difficult time taking vacations even before the economy slumped.
Japanese workers are the least interested in using all of their vacation days, according to the Expedia survey.
Christine Louise Hohlbaum, author of "The Power of Slow: 101 Ways to Save Time in Our 24/7 World," says even when Americans manage to take vacations, they still don't completely leave their office, because of technology.
Companies suffer because their employees are too tired or ill to be productive, she said.
Hohlbaum says she talked to a computer technician who found a way to take more time off but be more productive.
