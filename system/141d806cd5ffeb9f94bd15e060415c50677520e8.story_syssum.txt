(CNN) -- The head of the U.S. Coast Guard and a congressman planned to travel to the Coast Guard Academy on Thursday to speak to cadets about the discovery this summer of two small hangman's nooses on Coast Guard properties.
And during race-relations training in August -- set up in response to the first incident -- a white female civil rights instructor found a small noose in her office at the academy in New London, Connecticut.
The reports came amid a rash of incidents around the country involving nooses and their grim symbolism.
The so-called "Jena 6" case began about a year ago when white students in a small Louisiana town hung nooses from a schoolyard tree after black students sat under it.
The Coast Guard Academy has about 980 cadets, about 14 percent of whom are minorities.
