Realizing he needed to be strong for himself and his children, he began an intense workout regimen in the hospital -- then found his own brand of rehab in an unlikely place: a surfboard.
The nonprofit, volunteer-run organization is dedicated to teaching people with disabilities, most of them veterans, how to surf -- for free.
"We want to inspire them to move on and just be active and live full lives," said Cummings, 40.
The group holds one clinic per month at a beach on the California coast.
Before they get into the water, they receive "dry land" instruction on how to get up on the board.
"I remember waking up in the VA hospital in Seattle and not being able to move my legs," he said.
A year later, Davis taught himself how to walk again and attends as many AmpSurf clinics as possible.
"A lot of us have amputations or some sort of paraplegia, quadriplegia, are stuck in wheelchairs or stuck to their device, and just to be part of nature, to be free to move with the water, it's a freeing experience," Ruhe said.
"I always tell the volunteers, 'You're going to get 10 times more out of this than the person you help today, because everybody feeds off each other.
