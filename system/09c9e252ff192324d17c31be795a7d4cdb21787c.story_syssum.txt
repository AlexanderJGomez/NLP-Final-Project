Jerusalem (CNN) -- When Tanya Rosenblit boarded an inter-city bus bound for Jerusalem from her native Ashdod Friday morning, she did not anticipate the storm it would spark within Israel.
An argument ensued and ultimately the bus driver called the police to intervene, but not before a crowd of black-clad ultra-orthodox men had gathered outside the bus.
In a case brought by an Israeli woman earlier this year, the country's Supreme Court ruled that involuntary separation between the sexes on public buses was against the law.
Israel's largest circulation newspaper put her story on its front page with the headline, "They Won't Tell Me Where to Sit," and compared Rosenblit to the American civil rights movement's legendary Rosa Parks.
"Up until this day we have agreed to live in peace with mutual respect by all sectors of the Israeli society," he told his government ministers.
She said what motivated her to write about her experience was not "not to declare the Orthodox Jews as pure evil and the oppressors of human rights and liberties," but to point out what she sees as societal problem in Israel.
