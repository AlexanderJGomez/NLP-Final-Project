When he did, his victim was a correctional officer making his rounds, according to Kankakee County Sheriff Timothy Bukowski.
He then walked out of the jail's door and into the officer's brown 2012 Chevrolet Equinox SUV.
"The question for us is where did (the county correctional system) break down," Bukowski said.
What they don't know is how Taylor got out of his two-man cell, when he should have been locked down.
Taylor walked out the door and into the detention center's parking lot, where, authorities said, he clicked the correctional officer's key fob to find the Chevy Equinox.
He has a history of trouble with the law that predates his murder conviction, including an August 2009 sentence of five years, 10 months in Tennessee for robbery and resisting arrest.
After the verdict was read, Taylor sat down, looked back, then got up and ran, according to The Daily Journal in Kankakee.
