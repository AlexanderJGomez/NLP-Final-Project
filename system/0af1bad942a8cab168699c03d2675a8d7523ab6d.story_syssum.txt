(CNN) -- Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari on Tuesday insisted that his country's nuclear arsenal is "definitely safe," despite growing concerns about recent gains by the Taliban along the country's border with Afghanistan.
Still, Pakistan's military is continuing an assault on militants in Taliban-held areas after they seized territory in violation of the agreement signed by Zardari.
And, after making two visits to Pakistan in the last three weeks, Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, indicated Monday that he is "gravely concerned" about recent Taliban and al Qaeda gains across much of southern Afghanistan and in Pakistan.
A senior administration official told reporters that the U.S. objective of the meetings is "an alliance with these countries against a shared threat."
John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, and Dick Lugar, R-Indiana, would authorize $7.5 billion in non-military aid to Pakistan over the next five years to foster economic growth and development, and another $7.5 billion for the following five years.
The U.S. military has carried out airstrikes against militant targets in Pakistan, after Zardari's government was criticized for not cracking down on militants along the Afghan border.
Zardari also denied speculation by some Congressional lawmakers that his country has used most of the $10 billion given by the United States to strengthen its arsenal against a threat from nuclear rival India -- as opposed to going after the ongoing militant threat.
And -- but we are willing to do pretty much whatever we can to help the Pakistanis in this situation."
