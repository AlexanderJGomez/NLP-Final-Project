After 14 long years in the dustbins of Congress, mainly due to strong opposition from the Catholic Church, the Reproductive Health (RH) Bill was approved by both the Senate and the House of Representatives on Monday, 17 December 2012.
The Philippines remains one of the poorest countries in the world because, among other things, for a long time, it refused to acknowledge what could easily be seen when one glances out the window: the country desperately needs a reproductive health law.
The phrase "reproductive rights" includes the idea of being able to make reproductive decisions free from discrimination, coercion or violence.
The bill, at the simplest level, wants to give an indigent married woman the freedom of informed choice concerning her reproductive rights.
Yet the majority of Catholic countries around the world have passed reproductive health laws, even Italy where the Vatican City is located.
Other major Christian churches have not only officially endorsed the bill but have published learned treatises explaining their position.
This is the will of the Filipino people; it is the democratic expression of what the public wants from government.
The people are entitled to demand it from their government and the government is obligated to provide it to its constituents.
