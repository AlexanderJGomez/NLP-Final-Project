Political tensions flared Wednesday after more than 70 people were killed when fans rushed the field and rioted at a soccer game in Egypt.
A committee will investigate the circumstances surrounding the fighting, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said in a statement early Thursday.
"The police opened the gates separating us from the Masry fans and their hooligans attack us with everything: rocks, glass bottles, knives, swords.
"The police stood there watching, and the ambulances arrived late.
"There were organized groups in the crowds that purposely provoked the police all through the match and escalated the violence and stormed onto the field after the final whistle," said Gen. Marwan Mustapha of Egypt's interior ministry.
Many Al-Ahly fans were trapped in the bleachers during Wednesday's fighting, Eid said, because police did not open gates that would have allowed them to exit the stadium.
Egypt's military deployed two planes to transport the Al-Ahly team, some of its fans and some of the injured back to Cairo, he said.
Outside the Al-Ahly club's headquarters, angry fans vowed revenge.
... Whoever has any plot against Egypt will not succeed," Field Marshal Mohamed Tantawi said in a statement released to Egyptian media.
Some have threatened rebellion against the parliament and threatened the youth of the Muslim Brotherhood ... which may indicate that some police officers may be punishing the citizens for causing a revolution," the party said in a statement.
The large death toll from the fighting is unprecedented in Egyptian soccer, CNN contributor James Montague said.
Soccer was also closely tied with former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's government, which used the sport to boost his popularity, Montague said.
