Clearwater, Florida (CNN) -- Jury selection in the Casey Anthony murder trial continued Saturday afternoon following the rejection of nine potential jurors, including one man who posted to his Facebook account that he had a "title, cover and all" ready for a book about the case.
"You've already told us you live your life avoiding unpleasant things like the news," Ashton said.
Anthony's lead defense attorney sought to have the man dismissed for failing to disclose an entanglement with the law over apparent marijuana possession, but the judge refused.
Perry later approved the dismissal of a man who posted on his Facebook page what the potential juror said was a joking reference to a "book coming soon" after announcing he had been called for potential jury duty on a big trial.
After extensive questioning by attorneys, he told a grandmother who remembered "sweet pictures" of Caylee but said she had no preconceived notions of the case to stand by for duty.
In allowing the four candidates Saturday to pass to the next phase, the judge and attorneys increased the pool of potential jurors who have not been dismissed for one reason or another to 12, although attorneys still have until the jurors are sworn in to seek their dismissal, according to the judge.
Prosecutors have said they plan to show Anthony used "a substance" to kill her daughter.
