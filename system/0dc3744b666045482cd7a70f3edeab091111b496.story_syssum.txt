"We will be reviewing our security arrangements in partnership with London Marathon," said event commander Chief Supt.
It is a very sad day for athletics and for our friends and colleagues in marathon running," they said in a statement.
London is the next, after Boston, of the six races that make up the World Marathon Majors series.
A big security operation will also swing into place on Wednesday for the funeral of Margaret Thatcher, Britain's first woman prime minister.
The Metropolitan Police have said parts of the transport network will be closed down and there will be a large military and police presence on the streets as the funeral procession passes through central London.
