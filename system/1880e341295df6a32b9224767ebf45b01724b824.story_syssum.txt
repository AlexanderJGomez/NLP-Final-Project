The massage motion will increase blood flow and help release tightness in the arch.
Slowly rock yourself back and forth over the ball, moving it around the large muscles encasing the blade.
You should feel tension release down the hip and into the leg.
Roll over onto one side, prop yourself up on an elbow and place the ball just below your hip in the large part of your thigh.
To release, roll over on your stomach and put the ball right in the spot where your leg meets the hip and lay flat for about a minute, rolling slightly until you find your tightest spots.
