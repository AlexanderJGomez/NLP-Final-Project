In Sanaa's Change Square, Yemeni security forces shot live ammunition at protesters, injuring 11, witnesses and field medical teams said.
"Security forces were trying to kill us and not disperse us."
For weeks, demonstrators have taken to the streets calling for President Ali Abdullah Saleh to step down.
The latest marches against Saleh's regime came as the opposition Joint Meeting Parties sent a delegation to Saudi Arabia, where mediators are hoping to broker an agreement.
Today more females than males are protesting, thanks to Saleh's attack on women protesters," said Ameera Abdul Jabbar, a female activist in Sanaa.
