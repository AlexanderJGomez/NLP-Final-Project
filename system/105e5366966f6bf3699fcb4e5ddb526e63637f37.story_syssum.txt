China said on Thursday it would end the harvesting of organs from executed prisoners on January 1 and while the move has been welcomed by human rights groups, it's hard to see how China can wean itself from the controversial practice if the views of people like Zhou are anything to go by.
"People have concerns about whether the organs will be allocated in a fair, open and just way," Huang Jiefu, director of the China Organ Donation and Transplant Committee said, according to state media.
And just 0.6 people out of every million citizens have signed up to donate their organs when they die.
Huang said that prisoners will still be qualified to donate, but their organs will be registered in a computerized donation system instead of being traded privately, according to official English-language newspaper China Daily.
And earlier this year, authorities jailed a 12-member gang that recruited donors online and smuggled their kidneys by disguising them as seafood shipments.
Liu Teng, a 24-year old audio engineer from Beijing, says it's something he might consider.
