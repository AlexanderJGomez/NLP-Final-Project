(CNN) -- The psychiatrist treating the accused Colorado movie theater gunman was so concerned about his behavior that she mentioned it to her colleagues, saying he could potentially be a danger to others, CNN affiliate KMGH reported Wednesday, citing sources with knowledge of the investigation.
"Fenton made initial phone calls about engaging the BETA team" in "the first 10 days" of June but it "never came together" because in the period Fenton was having conversations with team members, Holmes began the process of dropping out of school, a source told KMGH.
It's not clear if Fenton continued treating Homes after he dropped out of school, whether she referred him to another medical professional or had any further contact with him, KMGH reported, citing sources familiar with the investigation.
During the week of November 12, attorneys expect a preliminary hearing and an evidence hearing that will include several days of testimony.
