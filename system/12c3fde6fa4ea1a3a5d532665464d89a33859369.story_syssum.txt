Suze Orman says it's a good thing the federal government bailed out troubled national insurer AIG.
Larry King: A few months ago, you said on this very show that you would be worried if there was another big government bailout.
AIG is an international giant that just doesn't have ramifications here in the United States.
So in this particular case, my opinion, thank God, they bailed out AIG.
Orman: It starts way back when there was nobody overseeing and regulating.
It's how many times have I said on this program, what were they all thinking?
So whether it's fraud or not, was there deceit going on?
On the other hand, if you're investing in a 401k every month with small amounts of money, that's OK as long as you don't need the money for 10, 15, 20 years.
These are the markets that you just sit on the sidelines and wait on the sidelines and stay away from them until everything works out.
Lehman, AIG -- I get that's all bad news, but the good news is for the main people that have to get by every single day.
Your gas bills, in terms of what you put in your cars, aren't going to be as high.
If we had lowered interest rates, the Fed funds rate, the banks would have been making more money on the money that they lent out, which would be helping everybody in the long run.
You would think that they couldn't, but when you see dinosaurs -- Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, AIG -- going down the drain, anything can happen.
