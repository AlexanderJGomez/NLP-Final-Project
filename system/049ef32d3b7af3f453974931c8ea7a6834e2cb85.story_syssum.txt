Some looked for someone to argue their case that King's dream was pass√©, no more relevant to today's politics than the race to the moon.
Jim Wallis, speaking at a celebration of King's life near the temporary art installation, acknowledged the "angry discussions about the legacy of this man."
Beck has likened the policies of President Obama's administration to those of Adolf Hitler and calls him a communist.
But King and the civil rights movement provided a moral vision that made it possible for the U.S. to find a way out of those ugly times.
Protesters in Danville, Virginia, got pummeled within an inch of their lives, then subjected to persecution.
Meanwhile, segregationists were pushing constitutional amendments to overturn the principle of "one man, one vote," to give state judges power over the Supreme Court and to give states the power to amend the Constitution without any federal involvement.
Segregationists in Congress even expressed hope that violence would ruin the march and the civil rights movement.
But amid what Garry Wills called America's second Civil War, the civil rights movement embraced the idea that the best way to gain rights was to appeal to everyone's hearts and meet "physical force with soul force," as King put it.

Move ahead, first into the swinging batons and electric cattle prods and water cannons.
They were not fighting for an earmark or a tax cut, loopholes from an EPA regulations, a Department of Education grant or a Fannie Mae subsidy.
But the existence of this massive movement, with hundreds of thousands of ordinary people willing to put their bodies on the line with nonviolence and even love, created real light in what could have been the darkest of times.
