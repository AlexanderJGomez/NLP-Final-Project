The U.S. military has obtained new video apparently made by those holding the lone American prisoner of war, Army Sgt.
U.S. efforts to free Bergdahl, including negotiating for his release, have so far failed.
"As we have done so many times over the past 4 and a half years, we request his captors to release him safely so that our only son can be reunited with his mother and father," the statement reads.
Later that year, however, the White House announced it was willing to send five Taliban prisoners to Qatar in exchange for Bergdahl.
