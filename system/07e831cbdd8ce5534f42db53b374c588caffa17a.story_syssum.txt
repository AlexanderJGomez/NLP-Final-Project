"At this stage, the reason for the strike remains unclear, but we hope to gain clarity as soon as possible," said a statement from Peter Turner, a Gold Field executive vice president.
Management at Lonmin set a Monday deadline for strikers to return to work, but workers did not appear to heed the call, as several thousand were marching outside the facility.
However, a national prosecutor has said that authorities would dismiss the provisional charges and release the miners, pending further investigation.
Clashes also erupted last week between protesters and security officers outside Gold One's Modder East gold mine in Springs, about 24 miles (39 kilometers) east of Johannesburg, police said.
The protesters had been fired for participating in an earlier illegal strike, the company said.
