Her case drew national attention after she started carrying a mattress around campus to protest the school's handling of the complaint, saying she hoped to show how "flawed" the university disciplinary system is when it comes to sexual misconduct cases.
During an April 2014 news conference at Columbia University, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand stood alongside Sulkowicz as she called Nungesser a "serial rapist" and said she fears for her safety while he's still on campus.
"As we have said consistently, we do not and have not commented on individual students or disciplinary cases not only because of federal student privacy law, but also because of our ethical responsibility to ensure all current and future students have confidence that the university will never publicly discuss private matters they share when interacting with counselors and support staff, the campus disciplinary process or other resources we provide to them," spokesman Robert Hornsby said in statement.
The most recent came from Nungesser in a Daily Beast article titled, "Columbia Student: I Didn't Rape Her," in which he shared a long exchange of Facebook messages to support his claim that their sex was consensual.
The project essentially consists of Sulkowicz carrying a twin-size mattress wherever she goes on campus, but not off campus.
