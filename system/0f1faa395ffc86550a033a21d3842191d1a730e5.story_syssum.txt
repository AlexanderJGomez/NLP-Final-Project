A car that appears to be theirs was spotted in a creek just half a mile from the girls' intended destination near Beresford, South Dakota, reported CNN affiliate KTIV-TV in Sioux City, Iowa.
South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley and Union County Sheriff Dan Limoges also said the vehicle, discovered in an embankment in Brule Creek, was processed and other items that potentially are evidence were discovered.
Dry weather had depleted the creek of enough water that it became easy to see the car, the station said.
"The case has been reopened multiple times over the decades, including in 2004, when the state's newly formed cold case unit searched a farm in rural Union County, two miles from the gravel pit," KSFY reported.
Investigators said one car may have belonged to a teenager who disappeared with two friends in 1970.
