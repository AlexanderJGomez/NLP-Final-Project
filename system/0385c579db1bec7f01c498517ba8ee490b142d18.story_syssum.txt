This new version of tennis, which marks some of the most significant rule changes in the sport's history, consists of the best-of-three sets with quick changeovers and sudden-death playoffs to prevent tiebreaks from dragging on.
Billed as tennis' answer to cricket's TV-friendly Twenty20, the two formats share more than just a catchy approach to branding.
Players will also have to hurry during end-changes, as there are no seating breaks and they get a scant 90 seconds to sit in between sets.
Proponents hope that the truncated timeframe -- each set is supposed to last no more than 15 minutes, with games typically not lasting for much longer than an hour -- will allow for a greater number of people to find the time to play tennis.
