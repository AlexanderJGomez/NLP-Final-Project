Toyota has announced no recall of these vehicles, however, and said it has not received any complaints about the brakes from consumers.
The NHTSA investigation involves only 2010 model year Prius hybrids, which went on sale in the middle of last year.
The Prius, which is built in Japan, is not one of the eight models affected by two recent recalls -- covering several million vehicles -- to fix problems with sticking gas pedals.
Late Wednesday, Toyota President Akio Toyoda spoke with U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, reassuring him that Toyota takes U.S. safety concerns seriously and puts safety at the top of the company's priorities, according to NHTSA's statement.
Even if the solution ends up being a relatively simple and inexpensive software adjustment, the Prius braking problems come at a bad time for Toyota, which has seen its prized reputation for quality and safety badly damaged by the recalls and the news attention given to them.
The company also said it changed the braking system software in January for vehicles built since then.
