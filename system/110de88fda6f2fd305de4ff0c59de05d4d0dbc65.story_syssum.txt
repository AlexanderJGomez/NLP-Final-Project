Novak died at home, over a year after doctors diagnosed him with a malignant brain tumor in August 2008.
"From its earliest days and for some 25 years, Bob shared generously with CNN and with CNN viewers his authority, credibility, humor and towering presence," Walton said in a statement.
Novak was a veteran columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times and a regular commentator for CNN for 25 years, beginning when the network launched in 1980.
In 2003, he found himself at the center of the scandal over the exposure of CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson, when he published a column revealing her CIA status days after her husband challenged a key Bush administration justification for the invasion of Iraq.
Novak later testified that the leak began with then-Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage and was confirmed by Karl Rove, who was then President George W. Bush's top political adviser.
Veteran Democratic consultant and on-air sparring partner James Carville said Novak "had the best sources in the Republican Party," making his weekly column a must-read for political insiders.
CNN suspended Novak, who apologized for using the word "bullsh*t" on air, and he resigned at the end of the year.
