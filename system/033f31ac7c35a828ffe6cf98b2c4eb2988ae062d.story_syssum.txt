"Everyone needs to bring their absolute A-game for 48 hours straight," says Jonas Huckestein, one of the winners who emerged from last year's inaugural StartupBus contest.
In fact, the StartupBus itself could be considered a meta startup: Organizers this year are developing an online game, the StartupBus Stock Exchange, in which players become virtual angel investors and invest in the companies as they're built on the buses.
After the mental and physical brutality, teams present their hurried masterpieces to a panel of expert judges during the interactive portion of this year's SXSW festival.
Because of the networking opportunities, the publicity from last year's contest and the sheer challenge of the undertaking, StartupBus founder Elias Bizannes was flooded with applications this year from prospective buspreneurs.
Neither actually became real businesses, but many people involved in the StartupBus' virgin voyage claim the experience was integral to both their personal and professional development, whether from skills learned or from connections made.
Over the last year, the competition has grown from one bus to six.
For an actual athletic competition, drinking the night before might be bad form.
