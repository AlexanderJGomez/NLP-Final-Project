If weather permits, consider having a daytime party outside on a picnic table, where it won't matter as much if you make a mess.
They don't need to be giant -- keep in mind that people will be taking their jack-o'-lanterns home at the end of the party.
If you plan to group pumpkins, rotate them to see how your design will continue from one to the next.
This year, try an upgrade on the usual toothy jack-o'-lantern and carve something that looks like art.
(You may need to cut slits into the perimeter of the template and overlap it so it conforms to the roundness.)
Start with the outline of the design and work inward.
Look beyond the knife drawer to implements intended for other uses -- say, a melon baller or a keyhole saw.
Try a new approach to pumpkin carving with smaller kids: Have children use their own drawings to create a template.
When the crew starts feeling as hollow as their creations, let them break for fall fare, including sage popcorn in handheld portions.
Sweet-potato soup gets its smoky essence from chipotle and a bit of crunch from a topping of salted pepitas; served in a mug, it's portable and hand-warming.
The party doesn't have to end once guests have finished carving their pumpkins.
