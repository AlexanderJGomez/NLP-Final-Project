(CNN) -- A Swedish wrestler who discarded his bronze medal in a protest during the presentation ceremony has been stripped of the award and disqualified from the tournament in Beijing.
The IOC said Abrahamian violated two rules of the Olympic charter, one that bans any sort of demonstrations and another that demands respect for all Olympic athletes.
On Friday, North Korean shooter Kim Jong Su had his silver and bronze medals taken away after failing a doping test.
Ibragim Samadov, competing in the light heavyweight category for the Unified Team of the former Soviet Union, was upset with his performance and refused to have the medal placed around his neck and only accepted it in his hand.
Samadov later apologized, but the IOC upheld its decision to disqualify him, and he was later banned for life by the sport's governing body.
