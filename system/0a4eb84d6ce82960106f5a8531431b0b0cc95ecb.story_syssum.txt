Recently, the embattled comedian's attorneys filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit accusing the actor-comedian of sexually assaulting plaintiff Judith Huth in 1974 at the Playboy Mansion when she was 15.
On the other hand, perhaps the jury of public sentiment will be swayed by Camille Cosby's retort today that media coverage of her husband is comparable to the Rolling Stone UVA alleged gang rape article.
Irrespective of the breakdown in communication between lawyer and client, this complaint should probably be dismissed.
Statutes of limitations are laws that set the maximum period during which one can wait before filing a lawsuit, and they vary depending on the state and type of case.
Under California law, the only way that an alleged victim of childhood sexual abuse is able to bring an otherwise time-barred claim is to allege that the psychological injury was repressed and was only discovered within the last three years.
First, when asserting claims based on alleged "childhood sexual abuse," a plaintiff over the age of 26 has to file Certificates of Merit, documents executed by a licensed mental health practitioner attesting that the allegations have merit.
After all, requiring some initial scientific proof of a repressed memory and injury is a good idea, but a medical provider cannot really provide any assurances about the identity of an assailant -- other than relying upon the patient's words.
You might think this is just a clerical gaffe that could be remedied, as many are, by filing an amended complaint (as she eventually did).
Recognizing this, modern jurisdictions have amended the normally inflexible statutes of limitations to allow victims their day in court, while seeking to protect would-be defendants from meritless claims.
That's how that "court" operates -- unfettered by the nuisances of the rules of procedure or evidence.
