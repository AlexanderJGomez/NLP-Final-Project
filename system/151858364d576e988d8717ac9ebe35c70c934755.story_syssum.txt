In a strong, apparently unscripted move on his recent visit to Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus, on Sunday the pontiff suddenly waved to the driver of his Popemobile, asking to get out.
While Israeli guards looked anxiously down from a nearby tower, wondering what on Earth was going on, Francis touched the wall with his right hand, bent his head, and prayed for several minutes.
This holy city, described in the Hebrew scriptures as the City of David, was under Ottoman and Egyptian rule for centuries.

It's time to pull down this barrier to freedom.
