After a steady 16 holes, overnight leader Jason Day finished with two bogeys to slip back into a tie for fourth alongside another Australian Marc Leishman (72) with America's Matt Kuchar one shot further back after posting a 69 earlier in the day.
Speculation mounted on Saturday morning that Woods might be disqualified for taking a drop in the wrong place after his ball had ricocheted off the flagstick on 15th green and back into the water hazard at the front.
I had a few opportunities to shoot a lower score but the finish was huge - the last three saves certainly kept me in the ball game," Woods said.
His ball also found water at the 15th which contributed two more dropped shots before bogeying the 16th to leave McIlroy five over for the tournament.
