Under coach John Calipari, Kentucky posted a 32-2 record over the course of this season -- with its only losses coming at the hands of Indiana and Vanderbilt, the latter coming in the Southeastern Conference tourney.
1 seed in the South bracket, and the favorite to win it all in the eyes of many pundits.
The Cardinals battled Kentucky tight throughout Saturday's game, tying the score, 49-49, at one point early in the second half.
The rest of the game was nip-and-tuck, with rarely more than a few points separating the two teams and several lead changes in the final minutes.
