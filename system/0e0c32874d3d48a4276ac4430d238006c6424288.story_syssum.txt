(CNN) -- Kaci Hickox, a nurse who worked with Doctors Without Borders to treat Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, was placed under mandatory quarantine in New Jersey for three days even though she tested negative for Ebola and is asymptomatic.
Consider the infamous 1927 case of Buck v. Bell -- a cautionary tale for all medical students -- in which the court upheld a state's involuntary sterilization of "feebleminded" persons in state institutions.
Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes stated in a judicial opinion that the "principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the fallopian tubes" to avoid further generations of "imbeciles."
But times have changed, and the collective views of citizens and governments today bear little resemblance to those of centuries past.
While the Internet unquestionably contributes to quicker and bigger waves of panic, make no mistake -- the connectivity of communication is a boon to, as well as bane of, public health.
The courts continue to recognize the government's broad "police power" to legislate for its citizens' health, safety and morals.
States seeking to take your personal liberty with a quarantine must establish necessity, reasonable means, proportionality, and seek to avoid harm.
What undoubtedly feels to Hickox like a violation of "basic human rights" may not automatically be the same as the "fundamental rights" closely guarded and scrutinized by the Supreme Court.
When it comes to infectious diseases, the collective jurisprudential message is as clear today as it was in centuries past: Public health concerns can warrant the state's intrusion on personal freedoms.
