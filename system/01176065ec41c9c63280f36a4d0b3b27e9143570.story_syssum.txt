If an advertiser has bid on that kind of search, that user could then see ads for discounted trips to Vegas the next time they visit Facebook.
"By bidding on a specific impression rather than a larger group, advertisers are able to show people more relevant ads while also running more efficient and effective campaigns," a Facebook spokeswoman said in a written statement.
Currently, Facebook ads are targeted based on users' profiles and the companies or other pages they "like."
"It's not going to be discernible to most consumers," he said.
"It's possible you might not be served an ad until after you took that trip to Vegas," he said, referring to the previous example.
It was just revealed that Facebook settled a lawsuit last month by the state of California over its "Sponsored Stories" feature.
