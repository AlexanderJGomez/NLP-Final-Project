"The city regrets the  loss of life in this tragic case, and we share our deepest condolences with the  Bell family,"  Michael Cardozo,  attorney for the New York City Law Department.
Undercover officers, who were investigating the club regarding prostitution allegations, said they identified themselves as police, but witnesses and the wounded men said they did not.
"The police response with respect to each defendant was not proved to be criminal -- i.e., beyond a reasonable doubt.
The department issued a  statement saying that after a "careful and thorough" review, there is not enough  evidence to prove that New York Police Department detectives "acted willfully"  when they opened fire on Bell and his friends.
Sharpton and Bell's fiancee and  parents were among more than 200 people arrested in New York  City.
