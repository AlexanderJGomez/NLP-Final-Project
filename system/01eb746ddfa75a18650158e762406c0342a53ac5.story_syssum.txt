Instead he is at the center of national media attention and exiled from his NFL team after a Miami Dolphins teammate made allegations of misconduct against him.
ESPN, NFL.com and other media outlets reported that representatives for Martin on Sunday submitted the voice mails and texts to the league and the Dolphins.
I'm gonna slap your (expletive) mouth, I'm gonna slap your real mother across the face (laughter).
Martin left the team suddenly last week and has not commented publicly on why he walked away in the middle of the season.
He uses profanity and the N-word in referring to one of his teammates who is also there.
Jay Glazer, an NFL analyst for FoxSports.com, reported that some of his teammates got up from a lunch table as a joke when Martin sat down.
Several media outlets said Martin had left the Dolphins because of bullying, something Incognito denied on Twitter.
The Miami Herald reported that a Dolphins source said Incognito is "done" with the team.
The Sporting News takes a yearly poll of NFL players, and in 2009 they dubbed Incognito the dirtiest player in the league.
Incognito, who played in the Pro Bowl all-star game in January, appeared to have calmed down on the field, according to a profile on NFL.com.
"I think a lot of people think of hazing as being cruel, but I don't see anything like that in this locker room," he said.
He said everyone on the team loves Incognito.
NFL players are "a bunch of testosterone-filled alpha males who are trying to find their place on the totem pole," he told Morgan.
In a segment shown on an HBO series that follows one NFL team during each preseason, Incognito figured out a teammate's iPad password.
He said it's a well-known "rite of passage" for a high draft pick to pick up a big dinner bill for some other players on the team.
