WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A group of Latino farmers is scheduled to return to federal court Thursday to argue that the government has discriminated against them in providing loans, disaster relief and other financial aid.
Hill has filed a motion asking the federal court to postpone the hearing pending a ruling from the Supreme Court on the class-action issue, or until November 23, whichever is later.
Thursday's hearing in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia is being held to determine whether any progress has been made in the case and to set a schedule and a mechanism for how to get the cases resolved, U.S. District Judge James Robertson said at the August hearing.
The farmers also point out that former Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman testified before Congress in 1997 that the USDA had a long history of discrimination.
"Our American dream was to have the whole family work together and to succeed as a Hispanic farming company," he told CNN.
