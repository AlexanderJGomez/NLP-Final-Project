"Thirty-four million women demand to have female Cabinet ministers; 34 million women demand to be eligible to run for president," Zahra Rahnavard, wife of reformist candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour.
She has been compared to first ladies in the United States, including Michelle Obama, for her visible role in her husband's quest for the presidency.
More women than men have voted in the past few elections, and Rahnavard has made a promise to her female supporters that their vote will count this time if Moussavi wins.
"A woman is there to fill her husband's stomach and raise children."
Mehdi Karroubi, the only cleric in the presidential race, has promised to campaign for women's rights.
He said she may win over reformists and women, but what will win the election is a solution to the floundering economy and a strong performance in the debates.
"And this is why we're so happy, because we can have a first lady."
