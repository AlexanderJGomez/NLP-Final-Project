With one hapless episode after another, the rollout of the President's plan to destroy ISIS is beginning to rival the less-than-splendid debut of the Obamacare website.
Ever since the President went on prime-time television to announce his new strategy to "degrade and destroy" ISIS, he and his team have slipped on one banana peel after another.
Is the threat from ISIS something we are trying to prevent from happening one day or is it imminent?
And listening to two of Obama's former defense chiefs, Bob Gates and Leon Panetta, one suspects they would have strongly opposed the plan if they were still in government.
And certainly the collaboration within the government in pursuit of Osama bin Laden was masterful.
Soon after he took office, Obama felt that through leaks to the press, his generals were trying to box him in on how many additional troops he would send to Afghanistan, trying to push him to higher numbers.
And they worry that a nervous White House will tie their hands in the fight, ruling out the force necessary to win.
This is very different from most recent conflicts when a President takes to prime time and within hours screens are filled with pictures of military mobilization or of rockets and bombs flying and the public is rallying round the flag.
In coming days, through his time at the United Nations and back in the White House, the President must dramatically seize the reins of leadership.
After all and let's admit it: when the administration finally fixed up Obamacare, it started to work better than many of us expected.
