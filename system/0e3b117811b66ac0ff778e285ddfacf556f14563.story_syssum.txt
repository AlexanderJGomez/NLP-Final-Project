The originators of the Occupy Central movement suggest protesters should retreat, as a new poll shows support for the movement flagging.
Yesterday, the movement took an unusually aggressive turn when masked protesters rammed barricades and hurled concrete slabs to smash through a glass door to Hong Kong's Legislative Council building -- where the city's government meets.
Pro-democracy legislator Fernando Cheung, who tried unsuccessfully to stop the smashing, told CNN it was a "major setback" for the movement that has won widespread praise for its politeness and civility.
This would trigger a by-election, giving Hong Kongers a chance to demonstrate their support for the democracy movement by voting the legislators back in.
"Our original plan was people would just sit down, holding hands, and peacefully let police arrest us," he said.
