Elliot Rodger's difficulties with women were so devastating to him that he vowed to kill anyone he couldn't win over.
Authorities say Rodger, 22, fatally stabbed three men in his home before killing two women outside a sorority house and then shooting a man at a deli in Isla Vista, California.
"How ironic is it that my father, one of those men who could easily find a girlfriend, has a son who would struggle all his life to find a girlfriend."
"As children we all play together as equals in a fair environment.
Reading the posts on that website only confirmed many of the theories I had about how wicked and degenerate women really are."
I had never seen what beautiful girls looked like naked, and the sight filled me with strong and overwhelming emotions," Rodger said in his autobiography.
Indeed, a whole new world had opened up before me, and I had no idea how to prevail in it.
The trauma got worse two years later, Rodger said, when he was at an Internet cafe and saw an older teen watching porn.
"Not getting any sex is what will shape the very foundation of my miserable youth," he said.
"Every day that I spent at my college, the more inferior and invisible I felt," he wrote.
He portrayed himself as an affluent young man who drove a black BMW Series 3 coupe and traveled the world.
Peter Rodger briefly worked as a second unit assistant director on the film, according to a spokeswoman with Lionsgate Entertainment, the company behind the "Hunger Games" movie franchise.
"For the past eight years of my life, ever since I hit puberty, I've been forced to endure an existence of loneliness, rejection and unfulfilled desires all because girls have never been attracted to me," he said.
