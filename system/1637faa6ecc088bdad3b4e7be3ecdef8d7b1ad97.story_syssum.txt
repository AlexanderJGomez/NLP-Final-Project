Hollande left France amid sinking popularity ratings and swirling reports that he cheated on his partner of seven years with a younger movie actress â€” making this week's trip something of an escape for the embattled president.
Hollande's predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, attended a formal dinner at the White House shortly after announcing his split from his wife.
"There are so many changes that take place, some that are more prominent in the news than others," said Capricia Marshall, who until August was the U.S. chief of protocol.
It's not necessarily a hard task, said McBride, because plenty of people would jump at the chance to sit next to Obama.
Once there they'll dine on four courses of American-grown haute cuisine â€” osetra caviar and quail eggs, a winter salad "served in a wonderful glass bowl to make it look like a terrarium," Colorado-raised beef, and a chocolate dessert sourced from Obama's native Hawaii.
On Monday the White House released the names and vintages of the wines poured at each course â€” a change from the last few state dinners, which listed only "American" bottles lest the price tag shock taxpayers.
That kind of glaring fissure in the evening's decorum isn't typical, said McBride, who did recall an incident during a visit by the Chinese premier she said was marred when a journalist shouted a question at the formal arrival ceremony.
While Hollande, like most other European leaders, has expressed outrage at allegations of NSA spying, the dust-up isn't likely to make any major dent in French-American relations.
His fluency in English might make him an easier dinner companion than his predecessor, as well as a more conversant travel buddy on the trip to Jefferson's Monticello the pair took Monday.
