(CNN) -- The Ohio state Senate passed a bill Wednesday that would curb the collective bargaining rights of public workers and strip away their power to strike.
The amended legislation would also restore collective bargaining rights on wages but ban strikes by all public-sector workers, imposing fines and terminating employment contracts for those who defy the ban.
Their GOP counterparts argued that it's needed to tackle an overreach of union influence they regard as an impediment to fiscal reform.
"That violates the fundamental principle that one cannot be simultaneously a judge and an advocate in his own cause," he said, calling for an "elected, independent, neutral" party to adjudicate those cases involving state workers.
Ohio, often considered a battleground for presidential politics, faces an $8 billion shortfall in the next two-year budget.
