The flight originated in Dayton and was closer to Washington when the threat was made, "prompting officials to let the plane proceed," Godwin said.
Upon landing, the plane was directed to a remote runway and the 44 passengers were deplaned, Mickalonis said.
But US Airways' express flights -- like the one from Dayton -- are experiencing delays as a result of the incident, airline spokeswoman Tina Swail said.
