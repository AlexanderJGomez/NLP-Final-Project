(CNN) -- Evidence in the case of a Michigan boy who vanished for nearly two weeks before turning up in his father's basement will not be turned over to prosecutors until at least next week, authorities said Wednesday.
That same day, the boy's father allegedly told investigators that he used a PVC pipe to discipline him, leaving a scar on the boy's chest, according to a petition filed with the Wayne County Department of Health & Human Services.
The petition quoted the boy's grandmother as saying that he appeared thin and sickly when she last saw him.
The child's father is not allowed to have any contact with Charlie while the investigation continues.
The boy's stepmother, charged with an unrelated probation violation involving a gun, pleaded not guilty in that case.
A lie detector test taken by the father was inconclusive, police said.
