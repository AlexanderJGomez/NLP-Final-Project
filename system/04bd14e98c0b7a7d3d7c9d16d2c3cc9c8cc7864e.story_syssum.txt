"They know what they did is wrong," Sheen, who claimed he is clean, said in a call from the Bahamas to the "Loose Cannons" radio program.
The actor, who began rehab treatments at his home in the wake of an emergency hospital visit in January, told ABC's "Good Morning America" in text messages Friday he is going to show up for work anyway.
The decision to halt "Two and a Half Men" was announced Thursday after Sheen spoke with the Jones show.
Sheen said the employees should be focused, patient and to understand "there are ways to deal with these clowns and take all their money."
"This bootleg cult, arrogantly referred to as Alcoholics Anonymous, reports a 5% success rate.
I cured it with my brain, with my mind," Sheen told the show.
"I have a lot of work to do to be able to return the support I have received from so many people," Sheen said in a statement then.
"If he had cancer how would we treat him?"
"When their workplace is affected, that's when you know things are really bad," said Pinsky, whose new HLN show premieres April 4.
Sheen was "very, very intoxicated, also apparently in a lot of pain" on the morning of January 27, according to a 911 call from a doctor who had just talked to the actor.
Paramedics went to Sheen's Los Angeles home and then took him by ambulance to a hospital, where he spent several hours.
