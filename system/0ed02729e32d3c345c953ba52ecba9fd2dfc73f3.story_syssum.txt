(CNN) -- Syria's civil war has been grinding on for nearly two years now, resulting in the deaths of more than 60,000 people, according to estimates from the office of the U.N. Human Rights Commissioner.
It's not going to be one day in which there's a decisive changing of the flags over a building in Damascus and then the whole country turns 180 degrees in terms of its government.
So that real sense of momentum has been in place for months.
Perhaps there are early indications that Assad does realize that he cannot hold on to complete power as he has in the past.
You'll see pockets of these regime forces, particularly in the north, being left to their own devices.
I think it's going to be a much more watered-down version of that.
It will be the moment where the Syrians finally expect the West to actually step in now that the complicated issue of who's arming who and who's fighting who has been put aside.
What we're going to see in 2013 are large numbers of displaced people, millions internally inside the country.
Paton Walsh: I think once the majority of the violence ends, once the nuts and bolts of the civil war are behind them, then food, utilities will come back reasonably quickly because of the nature of where Syria is and who it's bordered by.
... Any sort of sense of these opposition groups want to coalesce around democracy, those are not the indications we have at the moment.
And bridging that gulf between the men in suits in five-star hotels ... and people on the ground who may be starving or missing the roof of their house from shelling is going to be the enormous challenge.
And now you have a scenario where the West hasn't come to the aid of the Syrians, so people are deeply angry.
