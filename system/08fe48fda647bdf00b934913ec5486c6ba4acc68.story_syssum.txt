When the statues were discovered by workers digging a well in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, in 1974, the world was stunned by the spectacular funerary art and the legacy of the powerful emperor.
The difference is these female terra-cotta warriors are not out to protect any emperor, but were created to bring attention to the plight of girls in China.
After the exhibition, they will be buried in China until 2030, the year that, according to Chinese sociologists, men will have the hardest time finding a wife because of the skewed gender ratio.
She started working on the terra-cotta statues two years ago after finishing an installation in India that also explored gender bias.
Then, working with local craftsmen in Xi'an, 108 permutations of statues were made based Nourry's original eight statues by combining the different heads, torsos and legs.
Each terra-cotta warrior girl stands nearly 5 feet tall and weighs about 260 pounds.
Part of the proceeds from the sale of the eight original statues will pay for the cost of the eight girls' education for three years.
One looks at these amazing terra-cotta statues and feel compelled to ask -- why aren't there more of them?
