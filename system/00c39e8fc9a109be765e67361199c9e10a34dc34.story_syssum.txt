Investigators are looking into the apparent midair meltdown of the captain, Clayton Osbon, whose remarks and erratic behavior Tuesday led the co-pilot to lock him out of the cockpit.
The complaint says Osbon began making remarks during the flight that concerned the first officer, who is his co-pilot.
The cockpit voice recorder captures two hours of data and the flight data recorder, which measures the plane's speed and altitude, contains 25 hours.
By that time, the first officer had summoned another JetBlue pilot who had been traveling as a passenger to enter the cockpit and the two locked themselves inside, the affidavit states.
JetBlue has repeatedly praised the first officer, along with an off-duty captain who stepped in to assist and other crew members.
But his mother said on Thursday that he would reject the label.
The incident took place on a significant date for the family -- the 10th anniversary of the death of Jason Dowd's older sister, who died of cancer, Jean Dowd said.
He was in New York, speaking with officials about the incident, his mother said.
"He loved to fly, a love which he got from his dad," Judy Osbon said in a statement.
The pilot radioed he was losing power on both engines and was out of gas.
