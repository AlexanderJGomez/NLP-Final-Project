She was speaking from her hospital bed in Christchurch, New Zealand, after being rescued from the rubble of a five-story building that collapsed during Tuesday's 6.3-magnitude earthquake.
She had taken over at the reception desk to allow a colleague to go for lunch, and she was logging onto a computer when the "rumbling" started.
"A lot of concrete pieces fell on me and the desk sort of bent completely around.
I couldn't get my feet out, and there was a lot of broken glass and electrical wires so I couldn't move at all.
She was awakened by shaking, but she says she doesn't know whether it was an aftershock or the building further collapsing.
"When I came to, it (the piece of concrete on her) had moved and I was able to wriggle a bit.
She was taken to hospital with cracked ribs, heavy bruising and multiple cuts.
She said the feeling of relief was hard to describe, especially when she saw the state of the building.
Vos says she now needs to assess the damage to her possessions, and after experiencing two major earthquakes and many aftershocks, she may decide to move away from the area.
I don't know if my place has survived."
