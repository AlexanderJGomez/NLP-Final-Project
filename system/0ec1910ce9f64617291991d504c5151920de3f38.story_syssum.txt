(CNN) -- The blaze that killed two Boston firefighters last week was unintentionally caused by a welding operation, Boston fire officials said Friday.
The sparks probably festered in the wooden structure, with flames later fed by strong winds off the Charles River.
Ed Zabin, chief of the homicide unit for the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office, said investigators would try to determine whether anyone was criminally responsible.
Walsh and Kennedy were trapped soon after entering the building.
