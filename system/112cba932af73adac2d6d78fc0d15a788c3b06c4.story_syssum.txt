The decision comes at the same time the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is planning to spend spend the millions in stimulus funds to upgrade the border station.
But in light of Canada's decision, Customs and Border Protection spokesman Rafael Lemaitre says the government "is pausing construction at the Whitetail Port of Entry until September 1 in order to work with the Canada Border Services Agency to develop a joint solution that ensures the continued security interests of both countries."
Rehberg has asked Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to once again review the plan to spend $8.5 million dollars on the border crossing, adding that its his job as a congressman to "safeguard tax dollars, and I'm making sure this boondoggle doesn't slip through the cracks."
This is the second time plans for the Montana border stations have been put on hold.
It is not clear if anyone at Homeland Security discussed Canada's plans as part of that review.
