A South Korean judge said that her actions threatened the development of the aviation industry and inconvenienced passengers, and ruled that she violated aviation law, changed a flight path and interfered with operations.
But the flight attendant testified that she was pressured by another Korean Air manager to keep quiet about Cho's behavior.
The judge blasted Cho for her conduct, saying that she had used the plane as if it were her personal car and that as a passenger, she could not override crew members and give orders during a flight.
Park and Kim Do Hee, the flight attendant who served the nuts, had knelt in front of Cho in apology.
When the flight arrived in Korea, the flight attendant said another airline manager, Yeo Woon-jin, pressured her not to talk to investigators about Cho's physically abusing her and Park.
