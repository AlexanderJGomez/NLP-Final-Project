Atlanta, Georgia (CNN)  -- The next time a married man or woman glances your way, you might think twice before acting on impulse and frolicking between satin sheets.
The law allowing such legal action dates back to antiquated times when a wife was considered the property of a husband.
And that's why many legal experts are paying close attention to the Tiger Woods saga.
"If he had been dating a married woman, there could be the potential for a lucrative recovery," Rosen says.
"When folks are getting divorced, the threat of having the person's new boyfriend, girlfriend, husband or wife dragged into court and the dirty laundry aired ... causes enormous pressure," says Matt Steffey, a law professor at Mississippi College School of Law.
"Chip Pickering has fallen far faster than the surrender of Vicksburg," Steffey says, referring to a key turning point in the Civil War, when Confederates gave up the Mississippi River town.
The real doozy came July 14, when Leisha Pickering filed the alienation of affection suit against her husband's alleged lover, a socialite named Elizabeth Creekmore-Byrd.
But, Steffey and Rosen say, alienation of affection suits do just the opposite: They result in already contentious divorces getting even more heated, and they leave behind a public trail of personal shortcomings and wild tales of infidelity.
And anyone who tries that in a conservative state could get painted as a pro-divorce lawmaker who holds cheaters less accountable.
