Pakistan's military has denied the allegation, saying there is "no truth to the report."
The Financial Times newspaper in London reported that it had learned that Pakistan "allowed Chinese military engineers to photograph and take samples from the top-secret stealth helicopter."
But the tail section remained mostly intact and it was that area that the Chinese engineers examined, according to the New York Times report.
"They've taken some steps that have given us reason to pause on some of the aid which we're giving to the military, and we're trying to work through that," White House Chief of Staff William Daley said at the time.
