But officers have taken a shine to Jamal Rutledge since they arrested him in September in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
Rutledge, in cuffs, fidgeted on his seat, and stared at the floor, then he turned around to look through the security fencing behind him.
The officers rushed in, started CPR, called paramedics and gave Foulks a jolt with the defibrillator.
Rutledge was being booked on probation violation and other felony charges when Foulks had the episode, South Florida's Sun-Sentinel reported, citing detective DeAnna Greenlaw.
