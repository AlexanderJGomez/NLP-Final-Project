"We had set ourselves the objective of defending Mr. Kerviel against an injustice that is absolutely lamentable," Koubbi said outside the courthouse, according to CNN affiliate BFM-TV.
The bank was pleased with the original conviction because it placed responsibility for the rogue trades on Kerviel and not the bank.
Kerviel had pleaded guilty to the charge of computer abuse, but his attorney at the time, Olivier Metzner, had asked jurors in his closing arguments to acquit his client of the charges of breach of trust and forgery.
Metzner filed the appeal against the sentence, but Kerviel switched to Koubbi as his attorney in March this year.
Societe Generale, which said it discovered the losses in January 2008, said that at no time were supervisors aware of Kerviel's alleged unlawful activities.
