In a wide-ranging interview with CNN's "State of the Union," Cheney said the harsh interrogations of suspects and the use of warrantless electronic surveillance were "absolutely essential" to get information to prevent more attacks like the 2001 suicide hijackings that targeted New York and Washington.
"When you go back to the law enforcement mode, which I sense is what they're doing, closing Guantanamo and so forth ... they are very much giving up that center of attention and focus that's required, that concept of military threat that is essential if you're going to successfully defend the nation against further attacks," he said.
"All of these things required us to spend money that we had not originally planned to spend, or weren't originally part of the budget," Cheney said.
But Cheney said the United States has "accomplished nearly everything we set out to do" in Iraq, including establishing a democratic government in the Middle East.
Nearly two years later, a commitment of more than 30,000 additional American troops and a widespread effort to pay former insurgents to turn against Islamic militants helped quell the worst of the violence.
But Iraq was just one piece of our security, and this administration failed to realize that."
Though considered one of the administration's most influential figures, Cheney said President Bush rebuffed his advice on at least two issues.
And Cheney said he argued against the administration's policy on North Korea, which tested a nuclear weapon in 2006.
Cheney said Hill lacks the Middle East experience that his predecessors have, and "I did not support the work that Chris Hill did with respect to North Korea."
