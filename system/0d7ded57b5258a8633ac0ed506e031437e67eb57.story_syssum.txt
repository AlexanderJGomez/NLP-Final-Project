Her family's tragedy started on November 22 1986, when her father, Jose Martinez, had an altercation with a few customers at a restaurant he owned with his wife.
One of the customers, then 16-year-old Justo Santos, allegedly produced a firearm and shot Martinez in the chest.
Martinez grew up and eventually went to school to study law and Latin American studies, a path she later left for a career as a singer and actress, she says.
In one of her law classes, she learned that there were no statutes of limitation on homicides.
"Because November comes around, when is the anniversary of his death, and I just get upset."
In November last year, Martinez went looking for her father's file in the 34th precinct cold case division.
And in January, she went back to the police chief at the precinct and presented her case.
Martinez said the police were quick to respond to the information she gathered and were extremely helpful when she went to them.
"I am thankful to God and to my daughter for never resting and didn't care for how many years," she said.
