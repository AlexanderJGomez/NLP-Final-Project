Washington (CNN) -- In a dramatic slap at congressional authority, a divided Supreme Court has struck down a key part of a law that denies to legally married same-sex couples the same federal benefits provided to heterosexual spouses.
But the federal government didn't recognize Windsor's same-sex marriage, and she was forced to assume an estate tax bill much larger than those that other married couples would have to pay.
A federal appeals court last year ruled in Windsor's favor, saying DOMA violated the Constitution's equal protection clause.
But Kennedy -- a moderate-conservative who proved once again to be the "swing," or deciding, vote -- made clear the ruling is limited: "This opinion and its holding are confined to those lawful marriages."
But the court has cheated both sides, robbing the winners of an honest victory, and the losers of the peace that comes from a fair defeat.
Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito also dissented.
"I'm honored and humbled and overjoyed to be here today to represent not only the thousands of Americans whose lives have been adversely impacted by the Defense of Marriage Act, but those whose hopes and dreams have been constricted by the same discriminatory law."
Children born today will grow up in a world without DOMA, and those same children who happen to be gay will be free to love and get married as Thea and I did, but with the same federal benefits, protections and dignity as everyone else," Windsor said.
That law does not prohibit states from allowing same-sex marriages, but it also does not force states to recognize such marriages performed in other states.
Most of the current plaintiffs are federal workers, who are not allowed to add their spouses to health care plans and other benefits.
