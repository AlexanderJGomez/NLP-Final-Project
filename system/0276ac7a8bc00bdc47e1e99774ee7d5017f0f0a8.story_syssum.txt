(CNN) -- Myanmar announced Tuesday it will grant amnesty to 6,300 prisoners on Wednesday, one in a series of recent moves that could help the isolated nation normalize relations with Western nations including the United States.
"What's very clear is that (President) Thein Sein is willing to make more concessions in order to get sanctions lifted and get more international legitimacy," Farmaner said.
"Now I think it would be fair to say the elections themselves were flawed in many critical ways, and we have continuing concerns about a number of developments inside the country," Campbell, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said Monday in a lecture in Bangkok, Thailand.
In September, Myanmar's Foreign Minister Wunna Maung Lwin held a rare, historic meeting with U.S. officials in Washington following what a U.S. State Department spokesman characterized as positive developments after years of discord over human rights and other issues.
Nyan Win, a spokesman for Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party, said then that he thought the meeting "may be the first step towards reconciliation."
"He wants to take politics off the streets of Burma and bring it under the parliament's wing," Farmaner said about Thein Sein.
"Given that, this reform has definitely gone beyond what a lot of skeptics expected, including myself,' Kurlantzick said.
But a key issue that is not being addressed, said Farmaner, is rights for Myanmar's ethnic minorities, some of whom have waged armed insurgencies against the government.
Lift some sanctions if you want to send a message of encouragement, he said.
