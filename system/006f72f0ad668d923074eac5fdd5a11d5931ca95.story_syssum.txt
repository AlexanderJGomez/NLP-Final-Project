Currently, he is replicating the model he established at American Indian Public Charter School in various schools throughout the U.S. and Canada.
(CNN) -- Teachers unions and politicians are constantly claiming that K-12 public schools need more money in order to produce good academic results.
Of 707 eighth- and ninth-graders who took the California Standard test for general math: 1 percent tested advanced, 5 percent tested proficient and 94 percent failed by testing below grade level.
During my principalship at American Indian Public Charter School, we spent less than $8,000 per student, proving that schools did not need more money.
The hard work of these students and staff has paid off with virtually all of our eighth-graders testing advanced in algebra, including 100 percent of our eighth-grade black students, Mexican-American students and American Indian students.
They couldn't stand the behavior of the students, who, with little supervision or control, wreaked havoc in the area.
The United States spends more money on public education than any other country in the world.
Washington, D.C.; Detroit, Michigan; Los Angeles, California; Kansas City, Missouri; and numerous other cities throughout the United States are producing the same poor academic results at an extraordinary cost to the taxpayer and a tremendous academic loss to our students and country.
Next time you hear school officials or politicians begging for more money, ask them how large the district's budget is and how many students are enrolled in their district.
