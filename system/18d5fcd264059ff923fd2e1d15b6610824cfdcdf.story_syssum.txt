The Senate in France voted to ban child beauty pageants for kids under the age of 16 and now the measure goes to the country's lower house for debate and a vote.

Let them decide for themselves at an appropriate age if they want to pursue this when they are adults."
"And now it seems perfectly OK for a little 6-year-old to be walking around in thigh-high boots and short booty shorts and smacking her butt when she dances down a runway?
On the other side are moms like Anna Berry of Littleton, Colorado, who said her 13-year-old daughter Ashley was so shy she couldn't even order for herself at a restaurant.
"She's a role model to many and her confidence to stand up and speak out came from her improved self-esteem through pageantry," said Berry, who says Ashley can out interview and speak more confidently than most adults.
Teach these girls to be strong, confident individuals and see how far they go in life."'
She believes the pageant bodies should get together and create a new rule only allowing girls to enter when they are at an age when they can choose what they want to do for themselves, around 9, 10 or 11.
"I think outlawing them is a slippery slope where the government starts dictating what activities parents can or cannot make available to children," said Howard.
In this case, how would I feel if my girls wanted to enter a pageant?
Do you think child beauty pageants should be banned in the U.S.?
