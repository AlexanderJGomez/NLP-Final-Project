(CNN) -- A top international Red Cross official will be meeting with Syrian leaders over the next two days to discuss "urgent humanitarian challenges" in the conflict-wracked nation and permission to visit detainees amid stark reports of prisoner abuse.
This visit comes on the heels of an Amnesty International report detailing the deaths of at least 88 people in detention and widespread abuse of prisoners.
The latest international pressure on the Syrian regime was Friday, when the European Union banned the import of Syrian oil and added four more Syrians and three entities to a list of those targeted by an asset freeze and a travel ban.
It destroys the partnership approach to any crisis," Sergei Lavrov said.
