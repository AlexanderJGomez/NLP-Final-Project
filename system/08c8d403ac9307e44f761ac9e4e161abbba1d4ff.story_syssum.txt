The stores that line New York City's Fifth Avenue are filled with mannequins that come to life, DJs huddled over mixing boards and waiters lofting trays of free-flowing Champagne -- a scene lit by blinding flashbulbs.
While that might sound a bit pretentious, and just about as fun as, say, a sewing needle injury, Fashion's Night Out started for a more practical reason: To help the struggling U.S. clothing industry in an era of economic uncertainty.
It was clear that something needed to happen to get people comfortable with shopping again and to remind them that their purchases were helping to support the economy and the lives of those around them that worked in fashion," said Susan Portnoy, vice president of media relations at Cond√© Nast.
"In addition to the retailers, this event gives a boost to hotels and restaurants, public transportation and dozens of other industries.
The shop is modeled after a London townhouse in the 1920s, and merry women dressed in black and white maid costumes flit about the crowd waiting to enter the store.
"We always see a little boost in sales due to the increased foot traffic that results from the excitement of the evening," said Fiona Zeman, who handles public relations and marketing for Ted Baker.
"It also provides an excuse to broaden a shopper's horizons by exploring new stores and learning about new designers, plus it's a great excuse to gather with friends and enjoy an evening out on the town."
Despite all the distractions, she's also smiling because Fashion's Night Out, at least for her boutique, achieved its original goal.
