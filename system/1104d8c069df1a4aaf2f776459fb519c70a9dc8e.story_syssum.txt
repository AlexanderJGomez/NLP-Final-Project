The marquees of Broadway theaters will be dimmed for one minute in Stritch's memory at 7:45 p.m. Friday, the Broadway League said.
She was nominated for five Tony Awards and eight primetime Emmys over her long career.
Stritch was awarded two other acting Emmys, including one for a guest star role on "Law & Order" and one for playing Alec Baldwin's mother on "30 Rock."
Her first musical role on Broadway came a year later in "Angel in the Wings."
