In a Massachusetts court Tuesday, during testimony by one of three cleaning ladies in the Hernandez household, prosecutors showed video of  Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, taking a trash bag from the house and placing it in the trunk of her sister's car.
In the video shown to the jury Tuesday, Jenkins appears to walk out the back patio door of the Hernandez home carrying a heavy, black trash bag.
Jenkins, who was Hernandez's high school sweetheart, has pleaded not guilty to charges of lying to a grand jury several times about the presence of guns in the couple's North Attleboro home, among other issues.
In an effort to prevent her from pleading the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination, prosecutors have granted Jenkins immunity, compelling her to testify when they call her as witness in Lloyd's murder.
Prosecutors allege Jenkins placed the gun inside the garbage bag, covered it with children's clothing, and carried it to the car before driving away.
Jenkins told a grand jury she threw it in a dumpster, but couldn't remember where, according to prosecutors.
It could be something that was connected to this crime that he knew about, that he was covering up for somebody else after the fact.
