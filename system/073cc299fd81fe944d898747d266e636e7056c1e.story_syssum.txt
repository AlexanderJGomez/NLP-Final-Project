The Friday notice to lawyers in a terror case against Jamshid Muhtorov is significant because it allows the defendant to have court standing to challenge the program and its use in his prosecution.
The program is authorized under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which has become the subject of scrutiny since disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
The group has also claimed responsibility for numerous attacks against coalition forces in Afghanistan, a Justice Department statement said last year.
Muhtorov allegedly has sworn allegiance to the IJU, stating that he was "ready for any task, even with the risk of dying," the department said.
