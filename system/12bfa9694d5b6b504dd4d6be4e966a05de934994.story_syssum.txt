They also collectively condemn Pakistani support for the United States in the "war against terror."
A report by the Pakistan Peace Institute reveals that last year in the Khyber-Pashtunwakha alone 476 attacks were carried out by the TTP and associated groups, leaving 572 civilians dead (along with 115 security personnel) and injured another 1,529 (including 216 security personnel).
The delay by the military and police in tackling these groups was because they were not considered a substantive threat to the Pakistani state as a whole -- little is considered as great a threat to the existence of Pakistan as India and militants have been used as "proxy warriors" in that fight.
Following these operations, the TTP have been widely predicted to fall: military jets had successfully bombed TTP hideouts, doctrinal splits over "non-Islamic practices" seemed to paralyze them, in September parts of the TTP had announced a ceasefire and renounced violence, and a high turnover of leadership positions (the current spokesperson only being in place for a few weeks) leading to uncertainty among TTP foot soldiers and rumors of desertion.
The targeting of a school this week -- especially one where most of the students are children of military personnel -- is not just about gaining shock and awe but a continuation of its campaign to violently target those who challenge its moral order.
The TTP -- convinced of the possibility of a pure perfect Islamic order -- seeks to exclude from public politics and from the public spaces those that are "unperfectable:" women, homosexuals and the unrighteous who support infidels.
It also reflects their broader aim to confine politics to a restricted group of people ("righteous males"), a limited range of activities (excluding fine arts and public expressions of merriment), and a severely constrained public space.
If people hide behind closed doors, remain uneducated, the TTP's ideal of a restricted politics and an empty public sphere will become reality.
