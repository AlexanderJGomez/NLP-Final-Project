Bowe Bergdahl was released from nearly five years in captivity, yellow ribbons and banners celebrating his release decorated the main street, red-bricked storefronts of his hometown.
The letters were sent to the White House as part of a "Bring Bowe Home" campaign started through social media last November, just months before Bergdahl would be released.
In three months, O'Neill said, several hundred thousand letters poured into the White House.
Many of the soldiers who served with him accused the 28-year-old soldier of deserting his unit by walking off the Afghanistan base before he was captured.
But Bergdahl is also waiting to hear if he'll face any criminal charges in the military justice system.
The Army announced on Friday that Dahl completed the initial report on his findings in the Bergdahl case.
For nearly five years, the lives of Bergdahl's parents had been consumed by the plight of their son.
But the expected family reunion never materialized and the Bergdahl family soon stopped answering questions about why Bowe Bergdahl was refusing to see his parents.
Kemery said Bowe Bergdahl was raised in an intensely religious atmosphere with a strict code of conduct.
But Kemery couldn't say if that childhood rebellion was still a source of tension between Bergdahl and his family.
"Maybe it's the debriefing (reintegration process) or because he feels like he has let them down or for some other unknown reason he just doesn't want to have that emotional recognition again of his parents."
Bergdahl's lawyer has said the soldier would like to continue his education.
We are going to talk about things around the fire," said Kemery.
