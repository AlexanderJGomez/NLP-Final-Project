(CNN) -- Oklahoma State University women's basketball coach Kurt Budke and assistant coach Miranda Serna were killed when their plane crashed on the way to a recruiting trip in Arkansas, university officials said Friday.
Budke and Serna were on a recruiting trip to Little Rock, Arkansas, the university said.
"Kurt was an exemplary leader and a man of character who had a profound impact on his student-athletes," Oklahoma State President Burns Hargis said.
Serna was also in her seventh season with OSU after coming to the school to work for Budke from Louisana Tech, where they both previously worked.
Ten people, eight of them associated with the university's men's basketball program, died when their plane crashed in a Colorado snowstorm on January 28, 2001.
