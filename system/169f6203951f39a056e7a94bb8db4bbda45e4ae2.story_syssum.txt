The Pulaski County, Arkansas, jury on Wednesday convicted Curtis Lavelle Vance, 29, of capital murder, residential burglary, rape and theft of property in the October 2008 slaying of Anne Pressly, 26.
"Tonight, they have come back with a sentence, a sentence that they believe, and we share with them, is the harshest possible sentence for this gentleman going forward, where he will now spend the rest of his natural life in a 6-by-9 cell with nothing to think about but what he has done," said Guy Cannady, stepfather of the victim.
Cases like this, all you can do is put 'em in front of 12 good people and ask them to follow the evidence and do what their conscience demands."
Both doctors said they believe Vance has frontal lobe damage to his brain as well as cognitive impairment, according to KARK.
He had given several statements to police, including one saying he was at Pressly's home and another admitting to her murder.
"I found my daughter beyond recognition, with every bone in her face broken, her nose broken, her jaw pulverized so badly that the bone had come out of it," Cannady said.
