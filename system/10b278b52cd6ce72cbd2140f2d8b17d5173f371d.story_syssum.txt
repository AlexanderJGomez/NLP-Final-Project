Luckily, a friend was in the room to capture the look on Gardner's face in a picture that is delighting parents, moms-to-be and just about anyone else who has a heart.
We tried for 8 long years (taking a few months of here and there to keep our sanity!)
Gardner: So about a year and a half ago I decided to open up about our infertility struggles.
As for our Facebook page, my awesome sister Whitney set that up for me when we announced that we were having quads.
We just announced on our private pages to our friends and family and the picture was so priceless that everyone started sharing it and we started getting hundreds of friend requests from people we didn't know.
My husband is the oldest of 10 children so he is ready to take on anything!
He is the favorite uncle to all our nieces and nephews.
After eight long, heartbreaking years of infertility and every month passing by with a negative pregnancy test you do get discouraged!
They put both back to give me the best odds of one sticking so we would at least get one baby out of this since I didn't have any eggs to freeze and this was probably our last shot at this.
People loved the announcement picture so much they shared it and it just kept going.
