Or a sign of an increase in hostile behavior as U.S. troops complete their withdrawal from Iraq, similar to that seen when U.S. troops returned home from the Vietnam War?
"You're going to see this more and more over the next 10 years," said Shad Meshad, founder of the National Veterans Foundation, who has been working with veterans since 1970.

Ragan and Meshad noted that people who are trained killers can have trouble switching out of that role after returning home.

"It really takes a nationwide effort and a local community effort ... this is an issue that's not going to go away.
