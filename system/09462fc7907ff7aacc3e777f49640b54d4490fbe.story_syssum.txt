"The Environmental Protection Agency is continuously monitoring air quality in the area of the fire and downwind from the site and as of noon Wednesday have not detected significant levels of chemicals in the air," said a statement released by the city of Waxahachie, Texas.
When pressed, Pendery told the CNN affiliate that the plant was producing some chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing or fracking.
The Environmental Protection Agency is still studying the claims and is scheduled to release its findings in late 2012.
Officials ordered the evacuation of a school, an apartment building and other industrial sites within an eight-block radius of the plant, said Diana Buckley, an official with Ellis County government.
Officials have said burning liquid continued to fuel the flames hours after it began, but they appeared able to wrestle the fire under control by early Monday evening.
