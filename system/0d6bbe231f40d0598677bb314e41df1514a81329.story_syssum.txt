Berger, who has been practicing anti-aging and holistic medicine for 30 years, says he is now prescribing injections of HGH to about one out of every four people he treats at his Rejuvalife Vitality Institute in Beverly Hills.
HGH has been used since the 1950s to help children with growth problems, but it stayed under the radar for other uses until 1990, when Dr. Daniel Rudman reported in the New England Journal of Medicine that men taking a six-month course of HGH reduced their body fat by 14.4 percent while increasing lean muscle mass by 8.8 percent.
Dennis Pelino, a 60-year-old Beverly Hills entrepreneur, says five years ago, he was having trouble keeping up with the younger people he was doing business with, so he started treatments, which included HGH injections.
Pelino says HGH injections, along with a healthy diet, exercise, and supplements has made him feel 10 years younger.
Olshansky, who has studied anti-aging for over 20 years, contends that many of the claims are just false and says that only in the rarest of cases can HGH be prescribed legally.
The Albany-Times Union recently reported, citing unnamed sources, that rapper 50 Cent and singer Mary J. Blige were among celebrity customers allegedly identified in a New York probe of doctors and pharmacists who illegally prescribe steroids or HGH.
