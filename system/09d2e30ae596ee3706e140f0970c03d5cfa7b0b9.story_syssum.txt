Authorities found financial manager Marcus Schrenker, who they say  parachuted out of a plane while over Alabama, with deep cuts on his wrist at a campsite near Quincy, Florida Tuesday.
Authorities found the road book, with the Florida and Alabama pages missing, near the downed plane, according to a court affidavit.
Schrenker was "verbally resistant" to authorities' offer of medical help and was muttering a phrase with the word "die," said Frank Chiumento, assistant chief of the U.S.
Indiana officials have agreed to allow the federal case against Schrenker to proceed before seeking to have him extradited to Indiana, according to a statement from the U.S. attorney's office in the Northern District of Florida.
On the back of a book found near the crash, there was a list of what appeared to be summary points, "which included 'cracked windshield, window imploded, bleeding profusely' or words to that effect," according to the affidavit.
The plane later crashed near the Blackwater River in East Milton, Florida, missing a group of homes by 50 to 75 yards, said Sgt.
When police, who identified Schrenker using his FAA pilot's license, heard about the crash and returned, they found that he had checked in under a false name and had since disappeared, possibly into a nearby wooded area, authorities said.
"She is not guilty of anything other than trusting her husband of 13 years," said attorney Mary Schmid, who is representing Michelle Schrenker in divorce proceedings.
"In fact, Michelle first learned of the allegations against him when, on December 31, 2008, the police and investigators came to her door to search her home.
"Through no fault of their own, they are having to deal with the repercussions of this man's behavior and will be doing so for a long time to come."
