In addition, police said they would like help identifying "a man and a woman, both of Mediterranean appearance," between the ages of 20 and 30 and who were seen entering Wiliams' apartment building late one evening in June or July.
"There was no sign of any forced entry to the property, and no signs of disturbance inside," police said, adding that robbery did not appear to be a motive.
"Extensive forensic tests at the flat in Alderney Street and from the samples taken at the post mortem continue," police said.
Police believe Williams was last seen alive on August 15, when surveillance cameras show him shopping in the West End and Knightsbridge areas of London.
