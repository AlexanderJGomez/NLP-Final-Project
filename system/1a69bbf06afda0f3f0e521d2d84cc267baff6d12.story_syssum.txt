I should have expected that Dr. Oz would keep standing in the face of charges from a group of colleagues that he pushed "quack treatments ... for personal financial gain."
If Dr. Oz was ever going to go down, surely his ship would've sunk last summer in the wake of his disastrous testimony before a Senate subcommittee.
If the U.S. Senate couldn't bring him down, what made this particular collection of 10 doctors think they could do it with their recent letter to Columbia University, where Dr. Oz holds a tenured professorship and administrative position in the Department of Surgery and performs his duties at Columbia-affiliated New York Presbyterian Hospital?
Instead of mounting a defense of the indefensible claims he delivers so easily and often, Dr. Oz routed his critics by quickly pivoting to the undercurrents of their letter.
Dr. Oz was able to transition their critique of his apparent disregard for science on his program into an easily vanquished attack on his straightforward stand for consumers' right to accurate product labeling.
This whole affair would've played out quite differently if a slate of credible colleagues based at his own institution were coming out against Dr. Oz.
Both types of questions show the profound disconnect between most physicians, who tend not to speak unless they are certain in their expertise on a topic, and the way the media industry works.
Dr. Oz's show doesn't require he stay up late at night prepping for the next day -- he has an office full of production staff behind him.
He is now a polarizing figure, and while Columbia University should be lauded for protecting the free speech of its academic staff, the equation with Dr. Oz is becoming increasingly complex.
