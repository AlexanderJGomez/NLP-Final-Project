(CNN) -- Hundreds of students walked out of their Oklahoma high school Monday to protest the school's response to the alleged bullying of three classmates who say they were raped by the same person.
The teens and their families say school administrators failed to take adequate action after they reported the rapes and bullying.
He also said the school was enlarging a task force to study the implementation of a "targeted, research-based sexual assault curriculum for students," and that the school will continue to respond quickly to reports of sexual assault and bullying.
"After hearing the story we felt compelled to help the kids do something," said Stacie Wright, whose niece started the Facebook page.
But organizers estimated that 1,500 attended the protest outside the school, which has an enrollment of about 1,800 students.
