Even the most sprawling modern-day gaming experiences, such as "World of Warcraft" and "Call of Duty: Black Ops," still bow to the classic game design principle of keeping play easy to learn but hard to master.
It's that although the games are easy to start playing and enjoying, they increase in depth and complexity as the player gains more skill.
This makes it less intimidating for players of all levels to try these games, which slowly entice us into their web.
Instead of piling on pointless game variants or needlessly complicated controls, the most popular mass-appeal games often focus on executing a few simple features well -- and presenting them in endlessly novel contexts.
Freeform missions, jaw-dropping graphics and extensive online multiplayer support make excellent window dressing.
