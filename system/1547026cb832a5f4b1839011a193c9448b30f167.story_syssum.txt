(CNN) -- The cost of attending college has risen nearly three times the rate of the cost of living, and could eventually put higher education out of reach for most Americans, according to a National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education report released Wednesday.
Median family income rose 147 percent during the same period, the report said.
In most states, the percentage of an average family's income used for a public four-year college -- after financial aid -- has increased, the report said.
In addition, students who enroll in college take on more debt to stay there.
"The process is time-consuming, and there's also the stress of having to liquidate my investments and wonder where I'm going to find money," said Hahn, who had to scramble to find a new loan earlier this year after his lender suspended its private loan program.
Under Obama's plan, families would apply for financial aid by checking a box on their tax form, which would authorize their tax information to be used, and eliminate the need for a separate application.
The United States made modest advances in some areas of education, but the rate of enrollment and completion for college is below other countries, the report found.
