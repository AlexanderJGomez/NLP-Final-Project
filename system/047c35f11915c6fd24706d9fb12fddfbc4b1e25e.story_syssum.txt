But his invitation to testify before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on immigration was the real joke.
The fact that Congress has failed to do its fundamental job of adequately securing the borders and enforcing the law is lost on no one.
Although I have sponsored and co-sponsored more than a dozen bills and resolutions on immigration none has ever been given time before the subcommittee.
I skipped the Colbert hearing and returned to Utah to attend the viewing of a Utah soldier who was killed in Afghanistan.
Meaningful action on immigration reform has been paralyzed in part by broad disagreement over the issue of "amnesty" Disagreements center on what constitutes amnesty and whether current proposals by advocates for legalization of illegal immigrants represent an amnesty akin to what passed in 1986.
If the Colbert hearing was an attempt to distract voters from recognizing how little has actually been done, the strategy backfired.
They deserve leadership in Congress that will take the issue of immigration seriously instead of turning it into a comedy bit.
