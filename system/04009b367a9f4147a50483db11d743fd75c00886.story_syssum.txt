(CNN) -- Call it a meteorological mystery: Forecasters warned that there would be at least six Atlantic hurricanes this season, but so far we've seen only one.
Although the number of 2013 Atlantic storms is above average -- at nine so far -- the intensity of those storms hasn't matched the forecasts.
--In the western Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, fast horizontal winds have been cutting off the tops of potential hurricanes, sapping their power.
Respected veteran hurricane scientist Bill Gray of Colorado State University has pretty much given up for this year.
Poking fun at his government rivals, Gray jokes about "reports of a suicide watch" among the meteorologists who worked on this year's National Weather Service forecast.
The NWS -- last May -- initially forecast 13 to 20 "named storms," including seven to 11 hurricanes.
It would be a mistake to believe that the second half of any hurricane season would resemble the first half, says Vaccaro, who stresses that we're not experiencing a "lull."
-Hurricane Sandy, which altered so many lives last year when it slammed into much of the Eastern Seaboard, didn't appear until October.
"Nature sometimes throws us a curve ball as it has in the past when we've seen storms develop in the month of December."
--The Accumulated Cyclone Energy index -- a rating system that compares the intensity of storm seasons -- would normally be around 55 for the Atlantic.
This year, according to the ratings, storm activity in all the world's ocean basins is below normal.
Atlantic surface temperatures continue to be above normal, which also would help stir up storms.
At the National Hurricane Center in Miami, they're comparing this year to "a slow first half of a slow football game," says hurricane center spokesman Dennis Feltgen.
The mystery has grabbed the attention of Gray and other scientists, who are looking forward to analyzing all the data.
"Let's see what the rest of the season brings."
