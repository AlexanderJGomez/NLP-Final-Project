The word "selfie" first popped up in an Australian chat room on September 13, 2002,  to describe an undignified scene, the dictionaries' publishers believe.
This was the post: "Um, drunk at a mates 21st, I tripped ofer and landed lip first (with front teeth coming a very close second) on a set of steps.
"Language research conducted by Oxford Dictionaries editors reveals that the frequency of the word selfie in the English language has increased by 17,000% since this time last year," Oxford wrote in justifying its choice.
"Selfie" is not slouching on its thrown, Oxford says of its word of the year.
It has given birth to "helfie" -- a photo of one's own hair; "belfie" -- a snapshot of one's own backside; and "welfie" -- a selfie taken while working out, aka the most annoying kind.
