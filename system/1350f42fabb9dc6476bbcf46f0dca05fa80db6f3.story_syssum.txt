Copenhagen (CNN)Denmark was on edge Tuesday, as it emerged that the suspected gunman in the weekend terror attacks in Copenhagen apparently swore allegiance to ISIS' leader, and armed police responded to a bomb scare at the scene of one of the shootings.
The suspect in the attack has been named as Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein, a senior member of the Danish government said.
The Danish Security and Intelligence Service, PET, also confirmed Tuesday that it received a report from the Danish prison service last year warning that the suspect was at risk of radicalization.
Charges have been filed against two men who are accused of helping to hide the gunman, the men's attorney said Monday.
We will stand together and continue the everyday life we know.
He declined to specify when he first went into hiding and said he is not afraid.
The second victim was a man providing security for a bat mitzvah party taking place behind a Copenhagen synagogue.
CNN's Karl Penhaul and Dominique Van Heerden in Copenhagen contributed to this report, as did CNN's Ralph Ellis, Holly Yan and Hamdi Alkhshali.
