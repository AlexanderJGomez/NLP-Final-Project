During the raid that led to the arrest of the three men and one woman, police recovered 350 small plastic bags of what is believed to be heroin, the officials said.
Police discovered the largest amount of what is believed to be heroin in his apartment, the source said.
Vineberg was described by a former neighbor as a talented musician who used the stage name Robert Aaron and once toured with Wyclef Jean.
A spokeswoman for the New York medical examiner's office said Wednesday that a determination of the cause and manner of Hoffman's death is pending further study, including toxicology reports.
Preliminary tests Tuesday showed the heroin recovered from Hoffman's apartment did not contain fentanyl, a law enforcement official told CNN.
Police are trying to piece together the actor's movements last weekend as they look for anyone who might be linked to the drugs that apparently killed him.
On Tuesday,  a law enforcement source told CNN that the night before Hoffman died, he withdrew $1,200 from a grocery store ATM near his  apartment.
"Anything I could get my hands on, I liked it all," he said.
"And I always think, 'God, I have so much empathy for these young actors that are 19 and all of a sudden are beautiful and famous and rich.'
Magazine writer John Arundel said he met the actor at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah two weeks before his death.
But actor George Clooney said he had dinner with Hoffman a few months ago, and he seemed  fine.
On Wednesday night, the famed Broadway theater district will dim its marquees for one minute at 7:45 p.m. in Hoffman's memory.
"I just was really profoundly affected by his death and felt like it was important for me to be here," said Leslie Kritzer, a fellow actor.
"I also just think it's important to be here to remind people to have compassion and love for people that are struggling with the disease of addiction."
