(CNN) -- Michigan authorities are pursuing a new lead in the case of the infamous Oakland County child killer who abducted and murdered at least four boys and girls in the 1970s.
"Right now we are continuing to excavate the site to see if there is any more evidence we can locate," Shaw said.
Police agencies have pursued some 20,000 tips in the hunt for the perpetrator of the unsolved murders, which took place over a 13-month period between 1976 and 1977.
Several other children who went missing or were killed during that time may period also may have been victims of the Oakland County child killer, according to the task force.
Since this is a vehicle that we have been looking for for years, we will make sure if it's part of the crime scene or isn't, and rule it out.
