(CNN) -- Italian champions Inter Milan have unveiled new signing Samuel Eto'o, with the Cameroon striker immediately being forced to deny suggestions from the Italian media that he has ever had a problem with new coach Jose Mourinho.
"I have met Samuel six times in three years, and I never cared to know if he really said something not very nice about me," said the Nerazzurri coach.
Inter will also receive 45 million euros ($64m) but the 28-year-old, who only had a season left on his contract with Barca, has shrugged off suggestions this proves Ibrahimovic is the more highly rated of the two.
"I believe the victories I have earned until now can contribute to giving my name the right value."
"It's true I have always played in Spain but I have great experience of international matches," continued Eto'o.
