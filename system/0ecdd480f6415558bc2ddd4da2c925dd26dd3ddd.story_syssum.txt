John Couey had been sentenced to death for killing 9-year-old Jessica Lunsford in Florida in 2005.
"I never dreamed it would happen like this," Jessica's father, Mark Lunsford, told CNN.
"To me, death is sad," he said.
"I am not shedding any tears," the girl's grandmother, Ruth Lunsford, said on Wednesday.
"I don't feel sorry for him that he had to suffer," she said.
"I'm sorry I won't get to look him in the eyes as he died, but I'm relieved to know he'll never hurt another child again."
"Couey's timeline after he kidnapped Jessica Lunsford leaves open the possibility that she was alive, and in the house, at the time of the first and possibly the second interview," according to a prosecution memo in the case.
Howard, at Couey's sentencing, brought many in the courtroom to tears as he discussed how the girl died slowly as her oxygen ran out.
Although Lunsford's death was one of several that contributed to the passage of a federal child-protection law dealing with sex offender registration and other matters related to child sex offenses, Mark Lunsford said at the time of Couey's sentencing the law does not go far enough.
"I kick myself in the butt a hundred times a day," he said.
"No, that was a big problem," Couey said.
"You want to do something for her, give your life for the one you took."
