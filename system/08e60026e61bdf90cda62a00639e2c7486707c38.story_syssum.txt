Eto'o jetted into Russia on Wednesday and joined up with his new team-mates in Moscow on Thursday as they prepare for the weekend match with Rostov.
"I never say how many goals I'm going to score, my intention is to be happy and make sure that people around me are too.
I came to Anzhi because it is a new project and they are starting from scratch.
The Togo striker spent part of last season at Real Madrid, where he scored eight times in 22 games.
