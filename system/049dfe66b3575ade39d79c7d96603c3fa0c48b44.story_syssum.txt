The English language Buenos Aires Herald said Argentina's government had been silent on the death of Thatcher, who led Britain into the 1982 war over the Falkland Islands, a territory Argentina claims and refers to as Las Malvinas.
In its article on Thatcher's death, the English-language Santiago Times in Chile recalled the Iron Lady's support for the country's former dictator Augusto Pinochet, whose regime it said had supplied Britain with intelligence during the Falklands War.
Its editorial went on to speculate that Thatcher had been the West's last "iron" politician "partly because the decline in European power means they cannot uphold an iron stance."
South Africa's Mail and Guardian reported a "mixed response" to the death of a woman who believed in engaging with the country's apartheid regime and who described the ANC as a "terrorist organization."
It quoted former foreign minister Pik Botha as saying she had done more to help end apartheid than any of her contemporary leaders, while the ANC highlighted Thatcher's "failure to isolate apartheid after it had been described as a crime against humanity'."
"But Mrs. Thatcher knew how to stand up to Ronald Reagan when she needed to â€” for example, over the ill-considered United States invasion of Grenada," the newspaper said.
"She strengthened Britain's ties with the United States, bolstered its military, supported the placement of intermediate-range missiles in Europe (an extremely controversial move at the time) and spoke out with undiplomatic boldness when she took offense at some countries' actions," it said.
Some newspapers had highlighted her forceful personality while "some conclude, however, that her policies were too radical, and that Thatcherism no longer offers the answers to the economic problems of today," David Crossland wrote.
In the United Kingdom, the Daily Mail called for a state funeral for "The woman who saved Britain."
