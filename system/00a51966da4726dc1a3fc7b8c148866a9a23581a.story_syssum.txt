Two car bombs targeting Christians killed at least 38 people in southern Baghdad on Christmas.
In another attack Wednesday, a car bomb went off at an outdoor market where many Christians shop, police said.
The United States abhors all such attacks and is committed to its partnership with the Government of Iraq to combat the scourge of terrorism," according to a statement released by the embassy.
In 2003, there were thought to be 800,000 to 1.4 million Chaldean Catholics, Assyrian Orthodox, Assyrian Church of the East members, Syriac Catholics and Orthodox, Armenian Catholics and Orthodox, Protestants and evangelicals in the country, the group said.
The embassy did not elaborate on what kind of rounds were fired, or where in the compound they landed.
The group said it fired missiles at the U.S. Embassy and the main base of NATO, which leads the military coalition known as the International Security Assistance Force.
