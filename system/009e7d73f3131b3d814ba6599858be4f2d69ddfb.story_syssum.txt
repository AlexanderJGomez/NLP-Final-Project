(CNN) -- Investigators probably will have to use dental records to identify some of the eight people who were killed in a wreck involving a church bus and two other vehicles in eastern Tennessee, a Tennessee Highway Patrol official said Thursday.
Eight people were killed: Six on the eastbound bus; one of three occupants of the SUV, and the tractor-trailer driver, the Tennessee Highway Patrol said.
"It's been a very long night for all of us here," Cruz told reporters.
Some people walked out of the bus on their own, but emergency personnel had to extricate others, Miller said.
"This was such a horrific crash that determining if seat belts were used or not ... may be extremely difficult to impossible to determine," he said.
