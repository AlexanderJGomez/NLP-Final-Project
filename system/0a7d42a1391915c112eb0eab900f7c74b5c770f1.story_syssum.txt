One of the best places to start is Jambase.com, an aggregator of all things related to music festivals and concerts.
Generally, festivals will be teaming up with local and regional media and artists to offer unique side shows ranging from improv theater to art exhibits to on-site record stores and activist booths promoting voter registration and green initiatives.
Festival passes range from $50 to $250 or higher, depending on venue, location and who's headlining and promoting the festival.
Some camping events do offer luxury cabins or tents in return for higher ticket prices.
Depending on how much sleep you want to get or how close you want to be to the action (many festivals run 24 hours), you'll want to know if the camping sites are near the stages, scattered across the grounds, or both.
The uniqueness of many of the best festivals is rooted in their locality.
Chat about last night's set or join in a game of Frisbee.
Security will either confiscate prohibited materials or ask you to leave with no ticket refunds.
If you've done initial research on the area, take a short trek to one of the quiet spots you learned about and give your cochleas a break.
