(CNN) -- The United Nations refugee agency reported disturbing accounts of violence and persecution of sub-Saharan Africans within Libya Tuesday, urging a recognition of their particular vulnerability in the midst of civil war.
Libya's war has forced out 215,000 people, many of them poor migrant workers who have been stranded at both the Tunisian and Egyptian borders.
Fewer people are crossing over from Libya into Tunisia, a drop the UNHCR said coincided with intensified fighting in western Libya.
The U.N. World Food Programme said a convoy of its trucks was able to enter eastern Libya and was due to arrive in Benghazi some time Tuesday.
