He deserves more than second billing.
It's Dad who takes the kids and goes searching with them for Mother's Day presents.
Mom reminds the kids, and hands them a little money to shop with, saying, "Get him something he'll enjoy."
TV fathers have "evolved' from real people like Sheriff Andy Taylor, Beaver's dad Ward Cleaver and Heathcliff "Cliff" Huxtable, to cartoon dads like Homer Simpson, and Seth MacFarlane's caricatures in "American Dad!"
None of the latter are exactly the firm, wise, wisdom-dispensing fathers of the "back-in-the-day" TV dads.
He both dotes on and takes a firm loving hand to our first-family daughters.
I also recall the President saying on TV, with Michelle sitting right beside him, (foolish man) that he put more thought into his gifts, than he got back -- producing a very frosty look from the first lady.
President Obama knows about this -- he was raised largely without his father -- as does Bill Clinton, whose father died three months before the 42nd president was born.
My dad, Lionel, let me know how proud he was, even as he kept me from being too big for my britches.
On this Father's Day, I think of my Dad, my grandfathers, uncles and my two brothers who are good dads to their kids.
I also think of the fathers whose sons turned mass murderers, despite every effort to parent a son who'd make a good citizen.
There's no more important job in the world than raising a child, even when you're the President.
