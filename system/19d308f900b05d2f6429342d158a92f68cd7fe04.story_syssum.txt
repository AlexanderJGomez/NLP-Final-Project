That might not seem like a lot for a Premier League team, but for one that last season only narrowly avoided a return to the third tier, it's a significant amount.
However, the Al-Hasawi family could potentially achieve a much greater return on their investment at Forest than, say, the series of money men who have followed in Al Fahim's unsuccessful attempt to make capital out of former EPL side Portsmouth.
Or in the case of Portsmouth were taken over by the UAE's Sulaiman al Fahim and eventually became the first Premier League club to go into administration.
