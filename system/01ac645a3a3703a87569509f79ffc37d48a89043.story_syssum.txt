Paipote, Chile (CNN) -- In short order, freed miner Victor Antonio Segovia dispatches with some of the myths swirling around the 33 men rescued from the depths of the earth this week: He has no plans to write a book about what he endured in the San Jose mine, he isn't going to sue anyone for the collapse, and he intends to go back to working in the area's mines.
"Welcome home Victor Segovia," one neighbor said as she carried a handwritten sign greeting the miner into his home.
While Victor's brother Pedro Segovia waits under the scorching sun of Chile's Atacama desert, he nervously toys with a brand new Sony media player.
If Segovia  has troubling memories of his long, forced stay in the mine, so far he hasn't shared them with his brother.
The flags were a gift for her 50th wedding anniversary and were delivered by way of the "paloma" tube system that sent food and letters to the men.
Tripods and cameras are posted like sentries in front of the Segovia home.
So photographers agree and shake hands that all will stay in a fixed line so everyone can get an unobstructed shot of Segovia's homecoming.
As the party gets under way, though, clapping and joyous chants of "Chi Chi Chi, Le Le Le, los mineros de Chile," can be heard from outside the house.
Segovia said he missed his family terribly while in the mine.
Other miners have told CNN that the 33 men swore an oath never to discuss the details of what took place as the men struggled to survive in the mine.
Before he goes back to the party, Segovia makes it clear he is not completely free of the mine.
