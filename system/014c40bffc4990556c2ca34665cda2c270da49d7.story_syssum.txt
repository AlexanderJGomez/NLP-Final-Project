(CNN) -- One of the three guns Adam Lanza used to kill 20 children and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, was a military-style semiautomatic rifle known as an AR-15.
"Every month or so I take my guns out to the range and shoot.
"Sure, I could try to say that the reason I own these guns is self-defense, but the truth of the matter is that, although they will technically serve this purpose, they are not why I own them," he says.
"Because of my training, it's what I feel the most comfortable with."
It may not be the best or most important reason, but military-style weapons often appeal to the enthusiast side of the American gun owner.
"One thing about this country is how Hollywood has glorified the image behind those certain types of weapons.
To hold one in your hands, appreciate its history and design, and to be able to take that piece of history to the range and work -- it is a feeling that many people in this debate do not understand or appreciate."
Like most firearms, military-style weapons such as the AR-15 are semiautomatic -- increasing protection because the shooter can fire off many shots without having to manually chamber a new bullet.
Military-style weapons look more dangerous than other guns, he says, but really, there are many weapons available which are just as lethal, but which are not designed in a military style.
Many people would argue that we have no use for it today because the government is trustworthy.
