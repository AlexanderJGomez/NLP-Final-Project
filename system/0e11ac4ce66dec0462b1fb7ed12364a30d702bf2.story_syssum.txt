It's a question I often get asked, and in this interview I think people will, for the first time, get a real sense of his character.
I could sense how he had been consumed by his new way of life -- I've been there myself and other fathers will pick up on it too.
I had been chasing an interview with him for more than two years, so I wasn't there by chance, but in the end it all felt quite informal and relaxed.
The conversation continued as we walked out of the main building, past the small cottage he's currently occupying with his family and into their walled garden where the interview would take place.
William was very comfortable and revealing about his conservation work, and I can't wait for people to see the full version of the interview in next month's special.
His honesty even stretched to admitting he's looking forward to going back to work ... something other new dads will relate to, but perhaps won't admit quite as easily.
