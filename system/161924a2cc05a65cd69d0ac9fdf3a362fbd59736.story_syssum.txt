(CNN) -- British celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal has long been on a mission to stir his countrymen's culinary senses but the gastronomic pioneer has now turned his attentions to an altogether more complex problem -- rustling up gourmet airline food.
"Clearly, celebrity chefs are hugely successful and airlines are trying to overcome this stereotypical view of their food being unpalatable or stodgy," adds Jones, who is now professor in hospitality management at the University of Surrey in the UK.
"Airlines select products to go on their planes that are consistent with their brand image and the celebrity chef is another factor that makes up a portfolio of an airline's brands," says Jones.
The benefits brought by this brand synergy are also recognized by Marco 't Hart, founder and editor of the Netherlands based in-flight meal monitoring website airlinemeals.net.
He cites his own experience flying with airBaltic business class -- which has introduced the Slow-Food principles of Latvian chef Martins Ritins into airline food -- as a specific example of the quality of airline dining experience that can be achieved.
He adds that the technology on a plane is limited and the safety considerations of cooking whilst in the air means that those charged with preparing food on board will be restricted in what they are able to create.
