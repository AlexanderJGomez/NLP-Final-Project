By producing the magazine, ISIS is taking a leaf out of the book of its former ally al Qaeda, which has praised and advocated terrorist attacks in its glossy publication, Inspire.
The publication of Dabiq demonstrates that ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, is "looking not only to nearby areas for support, but is undertaking a global outreach strategy to recruit immigrants to build its state," the Institute for the Study of War said in a recent report.
ISIS has successfully recruited large numbers of foreign fighters from across the globe, including from the United States and Western Europe.
In the first issue, it focuses on an article co-written by Douglas Ollivant, an Iraq combat veteran and key adviser on the surge in U.S. troops there under former President George W. Bush in 2007.
"We take them seriously, write about them seriously, and perversely they then twist this to their potential recruits and say 'Look, you know, American analysts take us seriously,'" Ollivant told CNN.
