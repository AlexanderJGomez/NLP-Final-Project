Music, he says, has been a lifelong part of him.
"In 1990, a tribute album had R.E.M, the Butthole Surfers and the Jesus and Mary Chain performing Erickson's songs," the Chicago Tribune wrote in 2006.
"In the film (a documentary) ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons sounds like he's still in awe of Erickson and the Elevators, with whom he shared stages several times in the '60s," the article says, referring to Erickson's band, the 13th Floor Elevators.
The problems that kept Erickson from success in music also took a toll on his family life, leading to a separation from his wife and son.
In recent years, he has found his way back to touring with the help of his son, Jegar.
"I've been working with him for about five years now," Jegar Erickson said of his father last fall.
"It just turns on and it's magic and you feed off of it and anyone who gets a chance to be around him, it's truly incredible," the younger Erickson said.
