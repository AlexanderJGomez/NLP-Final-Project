(CNN) -- The National Football League announced Monday it will not overturn the penalty it previously imposed against the New Orleans Saints and members of its coaching staff for the team's bounty program.
Their suspensions will begin at the end of the preseason, according to Monday's NFL statement.
In public remarks, Payton has not admitted he lied to the NFL and insisted that no one was injured as a result of the bounty program.
But he did say in late March, shortly after his suspension was announced, that he was "disappointed" in himself and regretted not being more involved in the team's defense.
