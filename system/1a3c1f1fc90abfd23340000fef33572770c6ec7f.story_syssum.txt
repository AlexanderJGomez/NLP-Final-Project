The U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona declined to file charges against the Maricopa County Sheriff's office after an investigation into claims of abuse of county credit cards, misuse of funds and other financial matters.
Federal investigators "cleared my office of any abuse of power or wrongdoing that has been going on for years, and publicized almost every week for three years by the news media and critics," he said.
One of the allegations was that the sheriff's office misused county credit cards.
Another allegation was that the sheriff's office used funds earmarked for a program to pay the salaries of officers working on other projects.
"I know my people do the right thing, they have a tough job, and because I'm a high-profile guy, sometimes there's more interest given to what we do," he said.
