Webb told CNN on Thursday that while many people were astonished by the kill, he shot a boar of a similar size two years ago.
"They can't believe something that big is running around the woods of eastern North Carolina."
Webb and a few other of his fellow hunters at the White Oak Ranch Hunting Club had been tracking the massive hog since January on surveillance cameras they have placed throughout their hunting grounds.
On February 28, Webb had been in a tree stand in Bertie County for hours when he spotted the boar and took him down with one shot.
Wild boar are not native to the United States -- they may have come with Christopher Columbus -- and didn't appear in North Carolina until 1912, the state's Department of Wildlife website says.
There is no closed season and no bag limit.
