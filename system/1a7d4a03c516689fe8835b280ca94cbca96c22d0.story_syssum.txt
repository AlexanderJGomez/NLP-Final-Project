Paul Walker stars in "Fast & Furious," which exceeded expectations after taking in $72.5 million.
- Best opening yet in 2009, easily beating the bows of the more-buzzed-about "Monsters vs. Aliens" ($59.3 million) and "Watchmen" ($55.2 million).

2 was "Monsters vs. Aliens," which dropped a respectable 44 percent to earn $33.5 million.
Overall, the box office was up a monstrous 68 percent from the same frame a year ago, when holdover 21 outplayed a number of weak new movies, none of which had Vin Diesel ... whom you're going to start hearing a lot about, once again.
