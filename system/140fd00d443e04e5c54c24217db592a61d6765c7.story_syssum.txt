Black hair arguably is one of the quickest indicators of ethnicity, ethos and sometimes, politics.
It was because of his son Dante, who starred in a brilliant 30-second straight no chaser ad.
Dante and his gravity-defying, nonconformist hairstyle helped signal to New Yorkers that his father, Bill de Blasio, understands equality, empathizes with the victims of systemic bigotry and is more than qualified to lead the most diverse metropolis in America.
But while Dante's afro is being celebrated, in a different part of America last week a little girl in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was reprimanded because her hairstyle violated the policy of her charter school.
The fact that in her natural state, her hair was viewed as rebellious, signals that there is a lot of misperception that we must correct.
Let's hope that one day, hairstyles from the black community will no longer trigger powerful emotions or suspicions.
