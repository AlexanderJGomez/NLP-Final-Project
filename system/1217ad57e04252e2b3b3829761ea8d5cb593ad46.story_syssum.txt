Dakar, Senegal (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday called on countries throughout the world to decriminalize homosexuality, a day after the U.S. Supreme Court handed a major victory to proponents of same-sex marriage.
Obama said that the issue did not come up in their talks, but that the question of how gays and lesbians are treated has been coming up in Africa in general.
"But of course this does not mean that we are all homophobic," Sall insisted.
The decision was "not simply a victory for the LGBT community," he said, referring to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.
And what I think yesterday's ruling signifies is one more step towards ensuring that those basic principles apply to everybody," Obama said in response to a question from CNN's Jessica Yellin.
He had read Mandela's writings and speeches, and understood "that this was somebody who believed in that basic principle I just talked about -- treating people equally -- and was willing to sacrifice his life for that belief."
He called the trip a "powerful" reminder that "we have to remain vigilant when it comes to the defense of human rights.
"Obviously, for an African-American, an African-American president, to be able to visit this site, I think, gives me even greater motivation in terms of human rights around the world," Obama said.
