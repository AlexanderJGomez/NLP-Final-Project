In an interview on NBC's "Meet the Press," Cheney said the methods described in the Senate Intelligence Committee's report -- including mock executions, rectal feeding and sleep deprivation -- don't amount to torture.
He called the Senate panel's report "seriously flawed" and said the committee should have talked to officials involved in the interrogation program.
The president's former top political adviser, Karl Rove, said that's untrue in an interview with "Fox News Sunday."
Rove said Bush was briefed on the CIA's tactics and authorized some of the specific ones that were used.
Arizona Sen. John McCain argued the tactics outlined in the report do amount to torture, and said he would "urge everyone to just read the report."
