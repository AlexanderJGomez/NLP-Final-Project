But I didn't really ever have goals, the way that most people did."
Back home after an emotional Olympics in Sochi, where Miller cried during a live interview with NBC's Christin Cooper when asked about the recent death of his brother, Miller is focusing on another project: his Turtle Ridge Foundation.
He was a great athlete before his injury and was really having a hard time sort of adapting, which is a really tough process when you're injured like that," says Miller.
Watching Miller hurtle down the mountain, swarmed by a speeding army of tiny "Bodephiles," it's a wonder and a testament to his skills that the whole thing doesn't end in a giant human snowball.
"When we build some of our ski equipment and you give it to a kid who never had the chance to go up and experience what it is to ski down a giant mountain and you watch how life-changing that can be for them, I think it's really -- it's pretty incredible."
It may not be competition, but it is a goal he can take into retirement -- and still win.
