Suffern, who works part time as an administrative assistant for a home health care company, wanted to start budgeting for the holidays.
"I prayed that they will stop but god is bisy and needs your help."
Suffern explains that Amber is an emotional eater and weighs 140 pounds, nearly twice the size of her brother, Ryan.
Ryan would come up to Suffern to tell her in private about classmates bullying Amber -- how the kids in gym class would laugh at her when she could not do the bear crawl on the floor, tease her about her weight in class or tell her that she was adopted because she is multiracial.
And now every time I send her to school, I feel like I am not protecting her and I am letting her down," Suffern said.
"I wanted to do something to get (the story) out," Posnanki said, adding that bullying is a serious issue that deserves attention.
"If my kids don't call names and pick on others, I would expect other parents to teach their kids to be respectful, too," she said.
"I understand that sometimes schools try to do as much as they can, but bullying doesn't have to physical; name-calling and putting someone down are considered bullying to me."
We are saddened that this has taken place within our school family, and we can assure all of our parents, scholars and community that we will continue to do everything possible to provide them with a positive and safe learning environment."
