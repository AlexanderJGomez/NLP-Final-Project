Starting the minute healthcare.gov went live October 1, Lane spent five to six hours a day trying to make the site work before she finally managed to enroll two weeks later.
She was "immediately relieved" when she signed up on healthcare.gov because before Obamacare, no insurance companies would take them with their pre-existing conditions.
Without those healthy people, Obamacare could be in trouble, since an insurance pool only works well when healthy people, who pay premiums but use few services, are in it to help offset the costs of people like Lane and her daughter.
But some worry that even then, the website will have been branded as problematic and time-consuming, and some healthy people will prefer to pay the fine for being uninsured, which in many cases is significantly lower than the cost of buying insurance.
