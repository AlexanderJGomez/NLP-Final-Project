(CNN)  -- The suspect in last week's deadly shooting at a Binghamton, New York, immigrant center believed he had been harassed for years by undercover police officers, according to a letter received by a New York television station and purportedly written by that suspect, Jiverly Wong.
But the letter was dated more than two weeks earlier, March 18, indicating a troubled Wong had considered the act for some time.
What follows is details of Wong's beliefs that undercover police had taunted him, tortured him and spread rumors about him wherever he went.
At the end of the letter, Wong complained that he cannot "accept my poor life" and that he assume the role of judge and "cut my poor life."
