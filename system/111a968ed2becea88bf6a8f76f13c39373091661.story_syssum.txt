Bombardier airline President Eric Martel was candid about the prospect of an upturn, saying Monday: "It's no secret the light segment has been difficult over the last couple of years."
The design combines an all-terrain vehicle with a light sport aircraft capable of soaring 15,000 feet at a speed of 55mph, with a flying time of three hours.
It builds on the motor design of the company's signature product, a propeller-powered jetpack already established on the market.
The Terrafugia also made its air show debut recently and is set for sales next year.
"A decade earlier we saw new designs that made planes significantly more affordable...very light jets more like sports cars with wings that bought prices down from $75 million to $1 million.
But if the SkyRunner design is not yet cleared for take off, it provides an exciting and plausible glimpse of a future of aircraft ownership we can all aspire to.
