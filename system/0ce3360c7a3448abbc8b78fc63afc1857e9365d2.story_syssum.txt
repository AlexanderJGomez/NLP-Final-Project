All four pairs of players were charged with not doing their best to win a match and abusing or demeaning the sport.
The charges result from two lackluster contests in London that angered the watching crowds as the doubles pairs appeared to be serving into the net on purpose.
In the first of the Tuesday matches under scrutiny, Wang and Yu played South Korea's Jung Kyung-eun and Kim Ha-na in a game in which "neither side seemed to be exerting themselves," the official Olympic news service said.
Former badminton player Andy Goode, who represented Team GB at the 1992 Olympics and managed the team four years later, said the disqualification was the right call for the sake of the sport.
But Goode said the kind of tactical play seen Tuesday "does go on," especially in countries where the team ethic is very important.
The Chinese Olympic delegation "fully respects the Badminton World Federation's decision to punish" its athletes, it said in a statement.
The debacle has prompted wide debate on social media, with opinion divided on whether the players were exercising tactical nous within a poorly designed system or were guilty of failing the Olympic spirit and bringing the game into disrepute.
Although not widely played in the United States, badminton -- viewed as one of the fastest racket sports -- is popular in many European and Asian nations.
