Wang, who is also the new creative director of European fashion house Balenciaga, said music is an integral part of how he is inspired.
When the lights dimmed at Michael Kors' runway show, the music swelled and the models appeared on the catwalk in vivid orange, bright blue and taxicab yellow.
This season, Cho sits down with supermodel Naomi Campbell to talk about her legendary career and new reality show "The Face," take a tour of Coach President Reed Krakoff's 18,000-square-foot Manhattan town house, spend the day with a top model, buyer and editor to see the craziness and frenetic pace of fashion week (it's NOT all glitz and glamour) and talk one-on-one backstage with New York's hottest designer, Alexander Wang, who at age 29 was just named creative director of storied European fashion house Balenciaga.
The special will also include interviews with Sarah Jessica Parker, Drew Barrymore, Diane von Furstenberg and Michael Kors.
