(CNN) -- News of Angelina Jolie's decision to undergo a prophylactic double mastectomy has instantly increased awareness of hereditary forms of cancer caused by mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.
Individuals with mutations in either of these genes have increased cancer risks, most notably for breast and ovarian cancer.
A positive test result in BRCA1 or BRCA2 means that the person has a genetic mutation that increases cancer risk.
BRCA1 and BRCA2 are also associated with other moderately increased cancer risks that vary, depending on which gene has a mutation.
Genetic counselors and other health care providers can help determine whether genetic testing is appropriate by exploring one's personal and family history of cancer and other factors such as ethnicity, as BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are more common in certain populations.
Individuals with a personal or family history of breast cancer appearing before age 50, ovarian cancer at any age, breast cancer in both breasts, male breast cancer, multiple cases of breast cancer within a family, and breast cancer in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry should get genetic counseling to determine whether they should be tested.
Since BRCA mutations are not associated with pediatric cancer risks, testing for children is not recommended.
Considering the risk of breast or ovarian cancer based on age can be helpful in timing these interventions.
