The Grammy-winning singer told the audience at her next show about it, and videos of her harsh speech were posted on the web.
After she was released from jail, Apple did a concert in Houston where she launched into her critical remarks before her first song.
She said the behavior of the four was inappropriate and likely illegal.
Apple told the Houston concertgoers that she was going to keep the information private unless "you're interested in being a celebrity, I'll make you ... famous any time you ask," she said, referring to members of the sheriff's department.
She is currently on tour promoting her new album and was scheduled to perform in New Orleans on Monday night.
