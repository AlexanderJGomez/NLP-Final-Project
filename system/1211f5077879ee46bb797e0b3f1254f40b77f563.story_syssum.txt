(CNN) -- Donna Summer, the "Queen of Disco" whose hits included "Hot Stuff," "Bad Girls," "Love to Love You Baby" and "She Works Hard for the Money," has died, a representative said Thursday.
Words truly can't express how much we appreciate your prayers and love for our family at this sensitive time."
But with her 1979 album "Bad Girls," Summer broke out of the disco mold as the genre, which had become renewed by the success of the "Saturday Night Fever" soundtrack, was feeling a backlash.
It produced a Top 10 hit in the title track but fared relatively poorly on the charts -- especially after the success of "Bad Girls," a double album that spent five weeks at No.
It wasn't until 1983's "She Works Hard for the Money," which became a ubiquitous video as well as a big radio hit, that Summer's fame approached its late '70s zenith.
"I can't believe we've lost another wonderful singer," Dolly Parton said.
She was the disco queen, and will remain so.
"I was shocked to hear about Donna," singer Barbra Streisand said in a statement released by her publicist.
She had an amazing voice and was so talented."
She changed the world of music with her beautiful voice and incredible talent," Janet Jackson told Twitter followers.
They will be singing up a beautiful storm:)" actress Niecy Nash tweeted.
"I thought she was a very gracious and a very nice person.
My heart goes out to her family and to her friends and fans.
