A present from former Romanian communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu, the bear takes a place of pride in an exhibition house in Hyangsan, three hours north of the capital, Pyongyang.
In the introduction hall, the eye is drawn instantly to a domineering white stone carving of Kim Il Sung sitting in a chair.
Kim Jong Il was reported to be a huge fan of the NBA star.
Of course, these gifts look rather paltry when I entered the next room and saw an actual train -- a gift from the communist leader of the USSR in 1945.
The tour guide insists most of the ivory in the world is housed in this exhibition, a claim that sounds a little far-fetched but given everything else that I have seen, somehow wholly appropriate.
