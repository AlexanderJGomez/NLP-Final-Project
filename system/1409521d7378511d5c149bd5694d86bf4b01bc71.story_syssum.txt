"They rebooked everyone but me on another flight to LGA, so I am literally the only person on this plane," he posted.
O'Leary's Flight 6259, which normally seats 76 people, was delayed for six hours, and somehow he missed out on being rebooked.
O'Leary told ABC News the other guy reclined his seat and slept most of the way.
"It was definitely the most memorable flight I've been on in recent memory if only for the sheer lack of passengers to become bothersome," he told ABC News.
