Anthony Cumia, the "Anthony" portion of the shock-jock radio team, was fired by employer Sirius XM after Cumia made a series of racially charged tweets Wednesday night.
He let loose with a series of tweets, many with profane and inflammatory language.
When asked why by one person on Twitter, he responded, "Because I can take some punches w/out wasting the cops time."
It's not the first time the duo has been in trouble.
