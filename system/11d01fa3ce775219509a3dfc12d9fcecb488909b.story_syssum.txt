Both sides in the conflict have begun withdrawing their heavy weaponry from the front line of the conflict, in line with a peace deal agreed to in Minsk, Belarus, two weeks ago.
The separatists began the withdrawal of heavy weapons a couple of days earlier.
Meanwhile, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak warned that Russian energy giant Gazprom could cut the supply of natural gas to its neighbor in the coming days if payment is not received.
Russia has used gas as a weapon before, cutting off supplies to Ukraine three times in the past decade.
The latest disagreement comes against the backdrop of an EU investigation into Gazprom, which is due to report soon.
The chief monitor for the OSCE mission to Ukraine, Ertugrul Apakan, reported some progress in implementing the Minsk agreement as he briefed the council, but said much remained to be done.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of arming and training the separatists, as well as sending Russian troops over the border to fight with them.
