With a devoted fan base and an unrepentant work ethic, the 33-year-old has quietly transformed into a burgeoning powerhouse.
Like with most entertainers, Hart is familiar with the valleys that come before finding fame.
"The one thing about the business of entertainment is that you have to learn patience," Hart told Entertainment Weekly in 2011 after the independent release of his comedy tour, "Laugh at My Pain," did surprisingly well at the box office.
"The thing with patience is your time will come, there's just no telling when.
"His comedy comes from such a real place," Hart's frequent co-star, Seth Rogen, told Rolling Stone.
From the 2012 rom-com release "The Five-Year Engagement" to the 2013 sports flick "Grudge Match" with Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone, there aren't many worlds that Hart can't inhabit.
With more than 10 million followers on Twitter and an eagerness to connect with his fans, Hart is the antithesis of the unreachable A-lister.
But you don't need to hear him say it -- he often uses the phrase, "Everybody wants to be famous but nobody wants to do the work!"
