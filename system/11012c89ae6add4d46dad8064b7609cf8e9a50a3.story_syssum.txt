Editor's note: Below is an excerpt from Larry King's autobiography, "My Remarkable Journey," published by Weinstein books.
I'm certain that I was nine years old, because I'm sure of the date -- June 9, 1943.
There were three squad cars in front of my apartment building.
For years, before the war started and my father went to work in the defense plant, he'd owned a little neighborhood bar and grill.
The cops loved my father the way they loved any bar owner who had a great sense of humor.
He told me that my father had died.
We wound through the streets of Brownsville and ended up at a movie theater.
Sergeant Dane and his patrol are ordered to blow up a bridge to stop the advancing enemy.
I don't remember what it was like when I got home that day.
I'd been so close to my father -- yet I refused to go.
If one parked by my apartment building, I'd start running home, in fear that my mother had died.
