TOKYO (CNN) -- The U.S. military held a "Day of Reflection" on Friday for troops in Japan after allegations that two U.S. service members committed sexual assaults on the southern island of Okinawa.
"As responsible members of the Japanese community, and consistent with the values of our military, we will continue to do everything possible to prevent incidents," said Lt. Gen. Bruce A. Wright, commander of the U.S. forces in Japan.
Police in Okinawa said Thursday they were investigating a second reported sexual assault involving an employee of the U.S. Army.
The U.S. military announced Wednesday that it was restricting the movements of all American troops and their families in Okinawa because of the allegation involving the Japanese girl.
Newell spoke to his airmen at the base as part of the day of reflection, speaking about topics like responsible drinking and sexual assault prevention.
Locals have long complained about crime, noise, and accidents by the U.S. military, but resentment boiled over in 1995 after a 12-year-old Okinawan schoolgirl was gang-raped by three American servicemen.
She said reported sexual assaults committed by U.S. servicemen on Okinawa have continued despite years of promises to prevent them.
