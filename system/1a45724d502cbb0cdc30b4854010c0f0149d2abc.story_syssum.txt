Lubna Al Hussein -- who writes for a newspaper and, until recently, worked for the media department of the U.N. mission in Sudan -- was arrested, along with 18 other women on July 3.
Police accused Hussein of wearing trousers that were too tight and a blouse that was too sheer, she said.
The Arabic Network humans rights organization said the threat of flogging was retaliation for Hussein writing critically about the Sudanese regime.
"There are round-ups that they do and it is indiscriminate," he said.
However, Hussein resigned from her position with the United Nations to avoid the immunity she would have received, Adib said.
