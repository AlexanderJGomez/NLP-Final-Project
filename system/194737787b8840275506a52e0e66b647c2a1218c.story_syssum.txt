Police and witnesses said the fire broke out at Smart Fashions Limited at Mohammadpur, located in the inland city of Dhaka, and it quickly spread to a second floor where several hundred people, mostly women, were working.
"There was no fire alarm in the factory, and everybody rushed to get out of the two-story building as some workers shouted they saw flames on the second floor," said Rezina Begum, one of those employees who suffered injuries.
The country has about 4,500 garment factories, where workers make clothes for brands including Tesco, Wal-Mart, JC Penney, Kohl's and Carrefour.
The sector earned $19 billion in the last financial year, which ended in June 2012.
