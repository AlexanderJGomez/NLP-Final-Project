The bankruptcy of solar-panel manufacturer Solyndra, after a half billion dollar loan from the Federal government, has set off a hot debate on Capitol Hill.
It is also becoming a more established part of the world's overall energy supply.
For many people in the renewable business, the late 1980s and 1990s are remembered as the "valley of death" as the pioneers struggled to hang on, often by their fingernails.
Now, it was not only concerns about energy security and general environmental protection, which had stimulated the first boom.
Over the last decade, growing support by governments for renewable energy has been critical to its development.
As a result, consumers do not see the direct cost of the renewables when it comes time to pay their bills.
This is considered extremely ambitious, especially given the state's difficult economic situation and a 12% unemployment rate.
One solution is more use of natural gas as renewables' "partner" -- to generate electricity at those times when the sun and wind are off duty.
A "great bubbling" of innovation is at work all across the energy spectrum, conventional as well as alternatives.
The costs of solar energy continue to come down, and many of the new approaches under development and in the lab are aimed at further cost reductions.
This comes from the recent appearance of large volumes of low-cost natural gas, known as shale gas, which is extremely competitive as a fuel for electricity generation.
Wind and solar are small, but they are growing.
But they have been growing fast, and in the past few years, wind has been one of the main choices of many utilities for new generation.
That will be determined by a mix of government policy, technological advance, the world's energy needs -- and by sheer economics.
