Soldiers patrol in Mumbai on the eve of the trial of a key suspect in last year's attacks in the Indian city.
In his opening statements Prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam read from Kasab's alleged confession about how he trained for the attack.
It's alleged Kasab and his cohorts traveled to India from Pakistan by boat for the sole purpose of attacking India.
The trial was supposed to get underway April 15 but in a stunning turn of events the original court appointed defense attorney for Kasab was dismissed from the case that day.
The next day the judge appointed Kazmi, who was in the court during the proceedings observing the trial as a member of the Indian Bar Association.
