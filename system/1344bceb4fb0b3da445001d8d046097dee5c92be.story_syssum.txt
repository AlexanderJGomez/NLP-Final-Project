The Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai, India, temporarily increased security after being warned of a possible terrorist attack, the chairman of the company that owns the hotel said Saturday.
"It's ironic that we did have such a warning, and we did have some measures," Tata said, without elaborating on the warning or when security measures were enacted.
"I believe the first thing they did, they shot a sniffer dog and his handler.
The 105-year-old hotel was one of nine sites attacked by gunmen in a 60-hour wave of terror that killed at least 183 people and injured hundreds more before it ended in a standoff at the hotel Saturday morning.
However, for this latest trip, he said, he could walk right into the hotel without encountering the same measures.
Tata said that not even the army or commandoes who ultimately took over the offensive were prepared for the level of organization and execution that the attackers seemed to have put into their plan.
"We've been very complacent, because we've really not had this kind of terrorism inflicted upon us," he said.
Tata was hopeful that the attacks would unite Indians behind a common goal of preventing a similar tragedy.
"The general manager lost his whole family in one of the fires in the building," Tata said.
