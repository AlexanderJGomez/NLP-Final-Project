"It is difficult to continue when Syrians are constantly being hammered by the Assad regime with the help of outside forces," George Sabra, acting chairman of the National Coalition, said in a statement.
Al-Assad said it's too early to discuss whether or not he'll run again for president in the 2014 election.
In addition, Syrian state-run television have reported that forces loyal to al-Assad killed three Westerners -- an American woman, a Briton and a person whose nationality was not revealed.
The United States is aware of the report of the reported killing of the American and is working through the Czech Republic mission in Syria to obtain more information, a State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN.
The UK Foreign Office confirmed that a British national was among the dead.
