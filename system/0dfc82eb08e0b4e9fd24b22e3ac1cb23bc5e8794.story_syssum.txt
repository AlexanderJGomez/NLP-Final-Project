The father's voice shakes as he recalls the night his two daughters were snatched from their dormitory at an all-girls school in Nigeria.
By the time father made it to the Government Girls Secondary School, the militants had already opened fire on security guards and set buildings on fire.
And the hostel and dormitory, everything was bombed into ashes.
The trucks disappeared with the girls into the dense forest bordering Cameroon, a stronghold for the terror group whose name translates to "Western education is sin" in the local Hausa language.
This much the father knows for sure: His two daughters are among those still in captivity after almost a month.
The father believes that either supporters or members of Boko Haram live in his village.
The family is so afraid, he says, that they have fled their home and taken to sleeping in the bush.
The father said that starting around 5 or 6 o'clock in the evening, "people will disappear into the bush because there is no security."
A video that surfaced this week showed a man claiming to be the group's leader saying he will sell the hundreds kidnapped girls.
"Most of the women, we mothers, we started crying because had no one to help us," she said.
They adopted one of their two daughters after her parents were killed by the terrorist group.
"They don't know, probably one of them are born a president or doctor or pastor or a lawyer who will be helpful to the country," she said.
