Crider says Dhiab told her in a telephone call last week about the reported actions of the unnamed male nurse, believed to be a Navy medical officer.
A Pentagon official late Tuesday confirmed, "There was a recent instance of a medical provider not willing to carry-out the enteral feeding of a detainee.
The military refers to the controversial process as "enteral feeding," which is designed to provide liquid nutrition and medicine via a tube inserted in the nose directly into the stomach.
Crider said it was believed to be the first time one of the U.S. medical personnel has refused to carry out the feeding regimen.
"Petitioners request an expeditious hearing on this application because of the extreme nature of the human rights and medical ethics violations that result from petitioners' force-feeding," said the lawsuit, "and because of the imminent risk that it will deprive them of the ability to observe the Ramadan fast," which typically happens in July.
He has been cleared for release since 2009, but U.S. officials said they were reluctant to send him back to Syria because of that country's ongoing civil war.
However, the court simply cannot let Mr. Dhiab die."
