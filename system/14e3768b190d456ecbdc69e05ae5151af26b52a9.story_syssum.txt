Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Their stories were chilling: Students at a reform school recounted beatings and sexual assaults at the hands of school administrators and other employees who were supposed to be taking care of them.
"The primary obstacles to bringing criminal cases based on events alleged to have occurred more than 40 years ago are the Constitutional rights to a speedy trial and to due process," Hess wrote.
The allegations against school workers were made by a group of men -- now in their 60s -- who call themselves "the white house boys" after a nondescript white concrete building on the school grounds where they say the beatings and torture were carried out, often with a thick leather strap.
The report said there were inconsistent accounts from the men about various incidents, and a forensics examination of the "white house" building found no evidence of any blood.
"With the passage of over 50 years, no tangible physical evidence was found to either support or refute the allegations of physical or sexual abuse," it added.
Some of the accusers said the graves -- marked only by white steel crosses, rusted with the passage of time -- contained the bodies of boys who were beaten to death by school workers.
He said he walked into the school's laundry room one day and saw a black teenager inside a large tumble dryer that was running.
He wanted to save the boy, Colon said, and tried to talk himself into being brave.
But the FDLE report said there were inconsistencies in the story and a lack of evidence.
"We're attempting to move forward with a claims bill in the Florida state legislature to try and achieve justice for our clients," said Gregory Hoag, one of the students' attorneys.
Tidwell refused to cooperate with the FDLE investigation, the agency's report said, because his cooperation could result in a criminal prosecution.
"We're going to get some ground-penetrating radar, and we have guys who will go and find the bodies," he said.
