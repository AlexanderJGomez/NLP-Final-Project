We spoke to Josh McDermitt, who plays Eugene, about his time on "The Walking Dead" and what might be next for the character (that is, assuming he's OK after being beaten up by Michael Cudlitz's Abraham).
Some people have the strength and agility to rise to the top, and then there's people like Eugene who have to improvise and figure out a different way to survive.
I don't know if I would lie like that, but I'm just happy I didn't get Daryl killed or anything -- then everyone would hate Eugene for sure.
He and Tara feel like outsiders, and she's trying to work her way back into the group.
There's a little bit of hope for Eugene, but at this point he's a broken man, starting over.
I had to put it down for a while, because I was afraid I would influence it too much.
Then when I found out it was a mullet, I was like this is the only haircut I could get better.
We'll see how the damage is repaired, and it's not pretty, I'll tell you that.
