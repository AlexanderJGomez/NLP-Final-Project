But even though I take steps to keep my old electronics out of landfills and environmentally disastrous overseas disposal doesn't mean I'm willing to spend large amounts of time and effort to figure out what to do with them.
...Well, OK, there is one thing wrong with it: a few months ago I made the mistake of updating its operating system to iOS4, which drastically slowed its performance.
My phone's iOS4 performance problem is severe enough that I would be embarrassed to give this phone as a gift to anyone I know, or even to sell it directly to another party via Craigslist or eBay.
And it's toward the low end of the price range for what folks are asking for this phone on eBay today.
Frankly, if I had to deal with the hassles and risks of selling this phone myself via Craigslist or eBay, and also reverting it back to an older OS so it's bearably functional again to assuage my conscience, that iPhone would keep sitting on my dresser until the next electronics recycling drive.
Gazelle.com spokesperson Kristina Kennedy explained that the company, which buys over 20 categories of electronics products in addition to cell phones, ends up "finding new homes" for more than 90 percent of the used devices they buy.
But as soon as iPhone users knew when they could get their new model, trade-ins on the site soared to 1500 units per day for two weeks.
The Gazelle.com site did not ask me which operating system is on my iPhone 3G.
I asked Kennedy whether, given the widely reported troubles with iOS4 on the iPhone 3G, they'd start taking that into account into the price they offer on trade-ins.
