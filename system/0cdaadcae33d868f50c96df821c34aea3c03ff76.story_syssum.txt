San Diego, California (CNN) -- A U.S. District Court judge declined Friday to release the findings from authorities' search of accused gunman Jared Lee Loughner's family home because a federal investigation is still ongoing and a grand jury is preparing an indictment.
The marshals service attempt to release the two mug shots was based on a 6th Circuit Court ruling, and the judge said he would let media outlets in the 6th Circuit Court region -- Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennesse -- seek the release of the two mug shots.
Marshals Service planned to release them on February 7 under Freedom of Information Act requests made by 15 individuals, four of them within the 6th Circuit, according to court records and the judge.
The publishing company for the Arizona Republic newspaper and the Phoenix television station KPNX Broadcasting Co. were seeking to make public the results -- or returns -- of at least two search warrants executed in the Loughner case, one issued by a Pima County judge on the day of the shootings and another issued January 12.
Loughner had also faced two murder charges in the deaths of Roll and Zimmerman, but in a procedural maneuver last week, prosecutors temporarily dropped those two charges and plan to bring them back under a superseding indictment that is expected to include other charges as well.
Prosecutors intend to present a superseding indictment containing the murder charges at the next status hearing in the case on March 9, said Robbie Sherwood, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Phoenix.
Earlier last month, federal sources said that whether to support an out-of-state change of venue, a move that has happened rarely in recent years, appeared to be an ongoing point of disagreement within the Justice Department.
Federal sources said Silver -- if asked to move the trial -- would consult with officials of the 9th Circuit, the federal judicial region that comprises nine Western states.
