We even got to see them in action in the movie's first trailer, which was released the day after Thanksgiving.
Abrams teamed up with Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy to create a set of trading cards that are a callback to the ones issued with "Star Wars" debut in 1977.
His card acknowledges that he's "On the run," which might fuel speculation that Boyega's wearing Stormtrooper gear as a disguise.
In addition to those three, Abrams also revealed the name of the cloaked figure wielding that heavily debated new lightsaber: That character is Kylo Ren.
