Believe it or not, in our modern world, airplane tracking technology has yet to enter the 21st century.
Why don't all airliners stream their so-called black box data to satellites in real time?
• One satellite transceiver that could transmit and receive text messages and phone calls.
Despite this technology, the world lost track of the flight with the airline industry codename MH370.
Radar covers only about 2% or 3% of the planet's surface, experts say.
• Three minutes after the radio call, the plane's two transponders mysteriously cease transmitting.
All of these clues offer us only a few scraps of information that leave investigators with very little to go on.
In the wake of the tragedy, some called for airlines to modify their transponders to prevent anyone from being able to shut them off in flight.
We might know more about what happened to MH370 if air traffic controllers used orbiting satellites to track airliners, instead of radar.
There are numerous technical details that need to be worked out, but moving from spinning radar domes to orbiting satellites could eventually make blind spots in airliner tracking a thing of the past.
In the months since MH370 was lost, international aviation authorities have moved toward tracking airliners more closely.
They'll use satellite-based positioning technology to track flights at least every 15 minutes -- improving on the previous tracking rate of every 30 to 45 minutes, Airservices Australia said in a statement.
Although technology continues to shrink the planet in terms of communication, the tragedy offers a bitter reminder of how easy it still is to lose an entire airliner full of people.
