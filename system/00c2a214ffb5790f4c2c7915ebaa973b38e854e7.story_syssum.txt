LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britain's Prince Harry turned 25 Tuesday in the knowledge that he is now entitled to part of the multi-million dollar inheritance left to him by his late mother.
There had been fears that Harry, who is third in line to the throne, could become a target for Taliban militants.
He received a promotion to the rank of lieutenant in April last year and is now training to become a helicopter pilot with the British Army's Air Corps.
"It was a very stupid thing to do and I've learned my lesson, simple as that really," he said in an interview marking his 21st birthday.
