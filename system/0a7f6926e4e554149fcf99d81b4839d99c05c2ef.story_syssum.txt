LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Michael Jackson's ex-wife and the mother of his two oldest children, Debbie Rowe, has agreed not to challenge the singer's mother for custody of the children, according to a joint statement from lawyers for Rowe and Katherine Jackson.
Jackson's youngest child, 7, was carried by a surrogate mother, whose name has not yet been released.
"We were all united in our goals to do what is best for Michael's wonderful children, and both Mrs. Jackson and Debbie Rowe were on the exact same page," McMillan said.
Earlier this month, Beckloff granted temporary control to the executors named in his 2002 will: John Branca, Jackson's longtime personal attorney, and John McClain, a music industry executive and longtime friend.
He said the executors "have either denied Mrs. Jackson access to critical information or insisted on ... onerous and unreasonable restrictions" to information about deals they are making on behalf of the estate.
"I really tried to push the media to be responsible in how they try to handle this matter because there are three precious children involved."
Rowe gave up parental rights to Jackson in 2001, but she changed her mind more than two years later and sought temporary custody of the children.
