Two Brooklyn men who have spent the last 21 years in prison for three murders that DNA evidence suggests they did not commit were released Thursday on consent of the Brooklyn district attorney.
"Anybody looking at this evidence with an open mind would see that there is no chance in the world that Tony murdered his mother and these two little girls," Margulis-Ohuma said.
Yarbough was just 18, and Wilson only 15, when they were accused of murder.
Wilson was offered a deal by the district attorney's office for a nine-years-to-life sentence, but his case was disputed after he wrote Yarbough's family in 2005 saying that he had lied at the trial.
This case is part of a review of  Brooklyn killings from the 1980s and early 1990s.
Yarbough says he does not know what his next step will be.
"It was hard to keep my hopes up, but God is good now, I'm out now, I'm free, thank God," Yarbough said.
