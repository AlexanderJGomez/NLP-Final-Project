The entire school was to be put on lockdown.

In that presidential election year, the then-53-year-old businessman was running for the highest office in the country as the opposition candidate with the PAN, the National Action Party.
The party, formed in the wake of the bloody Mexican revolution that ended in 1917, had forged allegiances with unions, business sectors and power brokers so effectively that virtually no one in the country could move a finger without the PRI's blessing.
No restaurant would serve him and his people.
That year in July, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the PRI's candidate, won the presidency in one of the most controversial elections in Mexican history.
I was in Mexico this July as a CNN correspondent covering this year's presidential elections and, as far as I could see, the process was fair and transparent.
He only garnered 38% of the vote, less than the combined total of his three opponents, but that's the way elections work sometimes.
As far as I and an army of international observers and journalists could see, he's the legitimate winner.
Hope, rather than fear, was the driving factor as Mexicans went to the polls this year.
Enrique Pena Nieto's six-year presidency is an opportunity for him and a second chance for his party to take Mexico to the next level.
Will Mexico remain the country of untapped potential, being almost there, but never quite joining the First World?
