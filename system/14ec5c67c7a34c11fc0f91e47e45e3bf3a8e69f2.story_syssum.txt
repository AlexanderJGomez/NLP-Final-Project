(CNN) -- Nintendo announced a November release date for its next-generation Wii U on Thursday while looking to shore up two key constituencies -- those still puzzling over the console's "second screen" controller and hardcore gamers who still view the Wii as geared toward families and kids.
Players can play together, with one person using a TV screen and the other using the game pad, or a single player can get additional content on the GamePad that enhances the game on the big screen.
The company has trumpeted enhanced video and memory capabilities on the new system as a way to provide an experience that's at least on par with the rival Microsoft Xbox 360 and Sony Playstation consoles, which are preferred by many diehard gamers.
"Nintendo's presentation and vision is far more comprehensive and compelling than what they showed at the past two E3s," he said, referring to a summer video game conference.
The presentation made strides with the hardcore gaming crowd, but that key holes remain, he said, notably titles like "Bioshock: Infinite," "Tomb Raider" and "Grand Theft Auto V." Questions still remain about which, if any, of those titles will be coming after the launch period.
