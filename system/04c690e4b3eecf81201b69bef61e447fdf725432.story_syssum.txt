He took over Starbucks in 1987 with a vision of bringing Italian coffeehouse culture to the U.S. -- The Starbuck Experince, he called it.
Schultz: I think when you look at Starbucks as a business case what we've done and the way we do business is quite different than a classic consumer brand, and let me be specific.
We had no choice, we had to figure out a different way, but the point I want to make is that we built the brand by the experience and when you look back at history of starbucks we are the quintessential experiential brand built by what happens inside of our stores.
You have to find something that you really really love and I think you have to be willing to understand that this is hard to do, to build great enduring success and it takes personal sacrifice.
Schultz: But I would say something like this, that the success of the company is linked to the fact that the company really did try to have a conscience and a soul in everything it did and the success of the company was shared with its people, that would be enough for me.
