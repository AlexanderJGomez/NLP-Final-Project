"Well, we all know that the majority of the people that are coming to Arizona and trespassing are now becoming drug mules," Brewer said.
The drug cartels have taken control of the immigration.
"The simple truth is that the majority of human smuggling in our state is under the direction of the drug cartels, which are by definition smuggling drugs," Brewer's statement said, according to the Associated Press as reported in the Arizona Republic.
Brewer's statement is the center of a controversy over a recently passed law that requires law enforcement officials to ascertain the citizenship of the subject of any investigation if they have reason to believe their suspect is in this country illegally.
