But reading about Emily Bauer, a Texas high school student left brain-damaged after smoking "potpourri" she bought at a convenience store, really put him in her parents' shoes.
Bauer's tale set off warning bells for parents across the country: What is this drug?
Add in the statistics about the drug's popularity -- one in every nine U.S. high school seniors has admitted to smoking fake weed, according to a 2011 study -- and parents were alarmed.
"Honestly, if my child was seriously showing signs of wanting to smoke pot, or even just try it, I'd probably buy it for them myself and make them do it at home, in a safe environment, just to make sure they're responsible," commenter Rob Doerr wrote.
"My purpose is not to judge myself or judge others, but to get Emily well and help others learn from our mistakes, because obviously we did make a mistake, and I'll be the first to admit it."
While Bryant knows there will be critics and people out there questioning his parenting, he said he's just thankful to have more time with his daughter.
