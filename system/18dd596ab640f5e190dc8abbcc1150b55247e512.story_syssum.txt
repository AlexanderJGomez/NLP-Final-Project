In the space of one devastating week, natural disasters killed more people in Afghanistan than they did all last year.
"The scale of this landslide is absolutely devastating, with an entire village practically wiped away," said Richard Danziger, the chief of mission for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Afghanistan.
When residents from a nearby village rushed to the scene to help dig people out, the second landslide struck, sweeping away many of the rescuers.
The location, said Danzinger, makes it extremely challenging to transport heavy equipment and other supplies into the area.
"There have now been more Afghans killed through natural disasters in the past seven days than all of 2013," said Mark Bowden, U.N. Humanitarian coordinator in Afghanistan.
