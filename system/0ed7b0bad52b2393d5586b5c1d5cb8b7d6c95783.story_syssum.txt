Barcelona moved up to second with a 3-2 win at Villarreal in the late match, their first since the death of former coach Tito Vilanova this week.
Valencia, who are looking to overhaul a 2-0 deficit to Sevilla at the same stage of the Europa League, were also nearly at full strength and made a bright start against the league leaders.
Atletico's leading scorer Diego Costa had two good chances to make the game safe for Diego Simeone's men in the second half but they held out for a vital three points although losing Juanfran to a red card in stoppage time.
Sochaux remained four points from safety in 18th place despite the battling draw.
