We set Baltimore on fire this time.
We threw stones at policemen.
We let the violence stand for everything that's wrong with the things we already didn't like.
To which the only real answer can be: Stop kidding yourself.
I like to say we won the Second World War, we put a man on the moon, we invented the Internet, we gave the world jazz.
We cut Reconstruction short and made a mockery of equal citizenship.
About how slavery and its legacy are artifacts of a time past.
But there's another dimension of the story of "we" that matters as well.
Liberals gravitate on social media to commentaries or reactions that reinforce this frame, like the surprisingly astute comments from the Baltimore Orioles executive who spelled out why a long history of racial injustice and economic disenfranchisement made rioting nearly inevitable.
We cannot separate out the aspects of the problem that don't fit our preferred explanation -- not if we are sincere about solving the problem.
Whatever our political perspective, we need to open our eyes to what is actually happening in Baltimore and other cities in the United States in the second decade of the 21st century.
It's time to push each other out of our ideological and identity comfort zones and build unlikely coalitions to create more opportunity.
And there is no other "we" waiting in the wings.
