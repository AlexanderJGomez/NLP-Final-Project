After being introduced by Liverpool chairman Tom Werner, the 39-year-old Rodgers, who moves to Anfield from Swansea City, revealed that he had insisted that he would not work under a director of football.
"We might not be ready for the title now but the process begins today.," he added, a reference to the fact that Liverpool last won the title in 1990.
Rodgers spent a season in charge at Watford, in the second tier of English football, before moving to Reading in 2009, but he only lasted six months before he was sacked.
He took over at Swansea in 2010 and led the club into the Premier League at the first time of asking after a win in the playoff final against former club Reading.
Henderson will be hoping to add to the two international caps he has gained so far in his career.
