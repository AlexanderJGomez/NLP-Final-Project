CNN spoke with Schaefer to find out how Factory is facilitating start-ups and the burgeoning Berlin tech scene.
The big and important difference between other work spaces and us is that we're stage agnostic so we have later-stage companies or established companies like Mozilla, local heroes like Soundcloud or Wunderkinder, which are role models for younger founders to look up to.
And so I think not only do the founders of those companies invest and engage with early-stage companies, but also they still have to touch base with what they were like a few years ago.
And if it doesn't work at all, you'll hear from them when there's a lot of rent left to be paid.
So for anyone who wants to be part of that movement, it would make sense to be here.
