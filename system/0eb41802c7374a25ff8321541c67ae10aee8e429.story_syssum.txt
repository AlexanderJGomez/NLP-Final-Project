(CNN) -- "The Voice" crowned Texas teen Danielle Bradbery its new winner on Tuesday, proving to the country singer that she could do what she'd thought to be impossible.
The 16-year-old claimed the title during Tuesday's finale of the NBC singing competition, which was packed with performances from Cher, Bruno Mars and "Voice" coach Christina Aguilera, who will return to the series next season after a short hiatus.
Anybody who can sing like that, with almost no experience whatsoever coming into this thing, is very special.
But perhaps the updates will benefit "Idol" in the same way it's worked for "The Voice," which temporarily brought in Usher and Shakira as coaches this season in place of Aguilera and Cee Lo Green.
There's not a lot of great TV on network primetime that brings them all together.
