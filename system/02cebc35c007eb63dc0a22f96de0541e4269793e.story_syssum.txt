Describing a chaotic scene on the streets of the Thai capital Thursday night, Thomas Fuller of the International Herald Tribune described to CNN how Maj. Gen. Khattiya Sawasdipol was shot in the head as he was interviewing the opposition figure.
The United Front for Democracy (UDD) has turned the posh commercial center of Bangkok into a makeshift fortress, as they continue to demand that Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva dissolve the lower house of Parliament and call new elections.
Seh Daeng did not appear to be armed or have bodyguards but was dressed in camouflage jacket and a floppy hat, Fuller said.
Seh Daeng -- or Red Commander -- is a controversial public figure, even within the protest movement, Fuller said.
More than two dozen civilians and military personnel have died in police-protester clashes in the ongoing unrest.
