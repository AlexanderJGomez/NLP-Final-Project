But the guitar Dylan played on that mythic afternoon went missing for the next 47 years -- until recently, when a team of PBS researchers told New Jersey resident Dawn Peterson that she had it in her home.
The 1964 Stratocaster came with 13 pages of typed and handwritten song lyrics tucked inside its guitar case -- but host Wes Cowan was skeptical at first.
"Bob has possession of the electric guitar he played at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965," his attorney, Orin Snyder, said in a statement.
'A vast percentage of the stuff I get shown isn't real,' he says.
"I own a manuscript of 'Absolutely Sweet Marie,' and there's this line, 'the six white horses,' " Gold says.
If it's real, the guitar is estimated to be worth as much as $1 million -- but does Peterson legally own it?
"It's his guitar until he makes an affirmative act to give it to someone else or sell it," says lawyer Josh Grier, who represents artists including Wilco.
For now, Peterson is keeping the guitar in a secure, climate-controlled environment; she has not decided whether to sell it.
