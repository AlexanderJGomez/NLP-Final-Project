The Amnesty report said Chinese authorities declared martial law in some parts of the autonomous region in an apparent response to days of protests.
The students were marching toward the building that houses the regional government, shouting, "defend our land and defend our rights, according to the New York-based Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center.
