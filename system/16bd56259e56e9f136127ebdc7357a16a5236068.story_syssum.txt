Shanksville, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- First lady Michelle Obama and former first lady Laura Bush on Saturday led the commemoration for the victims of Flight 93, which crashed and burned as passengers and crew fought hijackers determined to strike the U.S. Capitol on September 11, 2001.
They agreed to the same bold plan," she said, referring to their decision to attack the hijackers.
Obama thanked her predecessor for helping the nation heal after the attack, and Bush praised her successor, saying she was pleased "to be here with the first lady who serves this country with such grace."
Speaking generally about 9/11, Bush praised the first responders in Shanksville, the rescuers at the Twin Towers in New York and the Pentagon, and the millions who took part in blood drives, vigils and memorial services.
As each name of the 40 victims were read, a bell was rung.
