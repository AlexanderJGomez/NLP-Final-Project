All four embraced as they received their gold medals, but Ryzhova and Gushchina were pictured kissing each other on the lips, prompting reports that it was a symbol of defiance in face of the controversial new laws.
They prompted a storm of international criticism, but Gushchina claimed Tuesday that she had not been aware of the controversy.
"I simply did not hear or read about it because I was totally focused on my performance at the championships," she told gathered reporters.
It has prompted calls for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Games and the 2018 FIFA World Cup, which is also to be staged in Russia.
