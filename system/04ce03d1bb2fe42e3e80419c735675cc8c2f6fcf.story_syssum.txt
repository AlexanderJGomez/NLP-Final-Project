Thanksgiving is a favorite day for football fans, close-knit families, families who can't stand each other, and of course, amateur competitive eaters.
We have all seen the "shopacalypse" on the evening news, which appears constrained only by the flimsy protection of a few Tensabarriers and some security guys.
Once a person steps onto private property, the law traditionally considered him one of the following: 1) trespasser; 2) licensee; or 3) invitee.
Deadly force can be used on an intruder in one's home, but that's based on defense of self, not defense of property.
You're not providing your pal any business benefit, other than emotional support for his team, and divesting him of his chips and salsa.
Historically, a landowner owed the invitee the highest duty of care, to inspect or warn of defects on the premises.
The bottom line is that stores will be liable if people are injured by known, unsafe and nonobvious conditions on their property on Black Friday, especially if stores take no special safety or security precautions, and treat the day like any other day.
No amount of security can prevent the unpredictable -- it's the same problem often encountered by stadiums when drunken sports fans attack.
If a Black Friday sale devolves into the running of the bulls in Pamplona, and the store knowingly allowed dangerous conditions on the property, it's likely that the store will be held liable for injuries on the premises.
So the next time you make fun of people who set out on Christmas Eve for the mall, remember this: The smattering of losers like me may have waited until the last minute to get our shopping done, but at least no one gets hurt in the process.
