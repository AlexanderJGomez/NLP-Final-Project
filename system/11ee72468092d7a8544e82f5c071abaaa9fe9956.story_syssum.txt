Lt. Gen. Mushtaq Ahmed Baig, the army surgeon-general, was among those killed in the blast in Rawalpindi, the officials said.
Plan's chief executive, Tom Miller, said the office immediately shut down as security teams looked into the incident.
Slater said 21 full-time and seven part-time employees work at the office, though it's unclear how many were present at the time of the attack.
The government promoted Baig to lieutenant general last January and he assumed his role as army surgeon-general the following month, according to a news release at the time.
It has, in recent months, experienced several suicide bomb attacks -- including the recent assassination of Benazir Bhutto.
Opposition leader and Pakistan's former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was killed at a rally in the city on December 27.
Two months before Bhutto's assassination, a suicide bomber detonated an explosive near the army headquarters -- which houses President Pervez Musharraf's office -- killing six people and wounding 10 others.
The other involved a suicide bomber who crashed his motorcycle into cars.
