For many of these families, fear of how their child will react to new situations -- and how others will react to them -- keeps them from gaining everyday experiences others get to have.
"If kids are not in the community, building their skills from very young ages, then there's no reason to expect them to be independent one day," Ross said.
Many Major League Baseball teams hold annual "autism awareness nights," when they take temporary measures such as lowering the volume on the public address system.
She armed all the Phillies game-day employees -- approximately 3,000 people -- with knowledge about autism and how to interact with individuals who have the disorder.
They are given a booklet with pictures illustrating each step of the game, from arrival and getting a hot dog to the seventh inning stretch.
Each family is also provided a clinician at the game who gives additional support if problems arise.
Ross hopes that this supported experience will give families the confidence to return on their own.
"The hope for Philadelphia is to make it the most autism-friendly city in the country," she said.
Ross also hopes that the tools she gives families can help them explore other settings on their own.
She believes this is just the beginning of their family's adventures.
