(CNN) -- The Sudanese president has vowed to "never give up" a disputed oil-rich region that has escalated tensions with South Sudan and sparked fears of the two neighbors' return to war.
"China again calls for the two countries to immediately stop hostility and respect each other's sovereignty," Liu Weiming, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a regular news briefing Thursday.
During the defiant speech, the Sudanese leader told citizens that "Heglig is in Kordofan," referring to a border state owned by the nation.
"If they do not understand, we will make them get it by force.
"We will hold this position," said Maj. Gen. Mangar Buong, a deputy commander for the South Sudanese military.
Unresolved issues include status of citizens, how much the landlocked South should pay to transport its oil through Sudan and the division of national debt, among others.
"The refugees coming in across the border have consistent stories of aerial bombardments and ground attacks" from Sudanese soldiers, he said.
