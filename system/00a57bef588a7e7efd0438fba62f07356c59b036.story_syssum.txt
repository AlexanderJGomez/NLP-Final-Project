Nearly 700 crew and passengers fell ill aboard the Royal Caribbean's Explorer of the Seas, the highest number of sick people reported on any cruise ship in two decades, CDC data show.
Norovirus is also suspected on board the Explorer of the Seas, though the cause of the illness there has not been confirmed.
CNN first learned of the stricken Princess ship from a Twitter post by the Houston Chronicle.
