After helping the Brooklyn Nets to relocate from New Jersey to his hometown borough this season, Jay-Z announced Friday that he will be selling his stake in the pro basketball team.
My sincerest thanks goes to Bruce Ratner, who first introduced the idea of moving the Nets to Brooklyn.
Our newest endeavor is committed to building the brands of professional athletes as we have done for some of today's top music artists.
Congratulations to The Nets on a great season and making the playoffs!
