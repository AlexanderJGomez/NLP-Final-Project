"While I believe that Rabbi Ralph Messer has good intentions during his message at New Birth, I understand that the ceremony he performed on Sunday, January 29th, caused harm to the Jewish community, for which I am deeply sorry," Long wrote.
Video from the ceremony showed Messer wrapping Long in the Torah scroll, which he said was recovered during the Holocaust.
He then directed four men to lift a seated Long in his chair and parade him before the New Birth congregation.
Rabbi Hillel Norry of Congregation Shearith Israel in Atlanta said last week the ceremony was "ridiculous."
He also doubts that the Torah scroll that Long was wrapped in is actually 312 years old, and had somehow escaped detection in a concentration camp.
At its peak, New Birth had around 25,000 members, and Long's sermons were broadcast around the globe.
