During Movember (the month formerly known as November), men around the globe grow mustaches (hence the name) while raising money for men's health issues.
Van Helden came to the United States two years ago for work and said he is just like any other guy.
There's not a whole lot out there in terms of support for men with charities.
The goal is to get your friends to donate money to your Movember cause, which is then donated to the Prostate Cancer Foundation, LiveStrong and other men's health research and awareness programs.
Worldwide, participants have raised $174 million, which, according to Movember, makes the group the largest nongovernment funder of prostate cancer research in the world.
First-time mustache grower Michael Erickson is excited about his friends' reaction to his new facial hair.
He has never grown a mustache and was prompted to join Movember by some Twitter buddies.
Like most men, he recognizes that he doesn't go for health screenings as often as he should.
The facial hair advocacy group has been around since 1965 and touts itself as "committed to battling a demonstrated discriminatory culture against people of mustached American heritage" by "promoting the growth, care and culture of the lower nose forest."
Instead, think about donating to their hairy cause or at least be inspired to get a health screening.
