Kano, Nigeria (CNN)Hundreds of Boko Haram gunmen on Sunday launched a predawn attack on the Nigerian city of Maiduguri and were locked in a fierce battle with government troops on the outskirts of the city, according to the military, residents and citizen vigilantes.
Both cities are tucked into the corner of the country, near the borders with Chad and Cameroon.
Boko Haram had been confined to the fishing town of Baga since its fighters seized it January 3, hesitant to move south towards Maiduguri because of the military presence in Monguno.
Shettima closed by asking the people of Borno to remain "optimistic and vigilant" and urged residents to keep close watch over their children and report any "strange person and movement" to authorities.
"All the residents of neighborhoods near Jintilo have fled into the city due to the ongoing battle between troops and Boko Haram gunmen who want to enter the city," said Modu Zannari, who lives nearby.
The hostages had been held in two Boko Haram enclaves since a January 6 raid on the village of Katarko, 20 kilometers from the state capital, Damaturu, in which 218 women and children were abducted, according to sources.
"They (Boko Haram) are still holding 26 young boys they abducted along with the released hostages in Katarko," said the politician, who asked not to be named for security reasons.
The attack was apparently in reprisal for a raid on a Boko Haram enclave by local hunters and vigilantes in Buni Yadi, 20 kilometers away, hours earlier.
