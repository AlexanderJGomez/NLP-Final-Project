A former prosecutor who declined to bring charges against Bill Cosby a decade ago said Wednesday that he wishes he could've nailed the comedian on an allegation that he drugged and molested a woman at his Pennsylvania home.
The terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but when journalist and publicist Joan Tarshis came forward with another similar story this weekend, Cosby attorney John Schmitt denied her claim and others', labeling them "decade-old, discredited allegations."
"I had a theory that Cosby had drugged the woman using something to make her sleepy and to make her defenseless or unable to recall what happened, but because of the delay, I couldn't check her blood," he said.
The case would have come down to she said, he said, and while Castor felt strongly that Constand was telling the truth, her statements alone were not going to be enough to convict Cosby, the ex-prosecutor said.
Castor released a statement on his office's website in 2005, saying that he found that "insufficient credible and admissible evidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could be sustained beyond a reasonable doubt."
Dickinson did not return a telephone call from CNN seeking comment, but Cosby has repeatedly said previous allegations are untrue.
His attorney, Martin Singer, addressed Dickinson's allegations specifically in a statement, calling them a "fabricated lie" and saying they contradicted what she wrote in her autobiography and what she said during a 2002 New York Observer interview.
"I woke up out of a very confused state not in my clothes," she said.
