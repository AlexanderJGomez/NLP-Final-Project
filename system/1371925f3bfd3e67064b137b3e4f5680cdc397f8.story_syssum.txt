Now London's historic River Thames has played host to a new generation of boat -- one which could revolutionize not just the future of nautical design, but scientific research on the high seas.
The $16 million vessel cut an impressive figure as it cruised beneath London's raised Tower Bridge, marking the end of an almost three-month scientific expedition along the Atlantic's warm Gulf Stream.
It continued to break the record books earlier this year when it made the fastest solar-powered crossing of the Atlantic -- traveling from Spain to the West Indies in 22 days and breaking its own previous record by four days.
"In fact, we were two miles off the coast of Monaco when some people called the police to say there was an airplane on the water."
It may also prove to be the beginnings of an epic adventure -- this time on the high seas.
