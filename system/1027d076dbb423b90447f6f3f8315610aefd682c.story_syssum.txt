Exactly 365 days have passed since the girls were snatched from their boarding school dormitories in the dead of night in Chibok, northeastern Nigeria.
Caught in the blinding glare of global attention, and facing a tide of questions about their bungled response to the kidnappings, the Nigerian government felt the weight of accountability and was spurred to take greater action; offers of assistance from the likes of the US, UK, France, and China were accepted.
My heart goes out to the grief-stricken loved ones of these missing girls on this painful anniversary.
We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.
Our common humanity compels us to do our part, to right this shameful wrong.
