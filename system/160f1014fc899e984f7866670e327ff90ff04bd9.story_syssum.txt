Heywood was found dead last November in his hotel room in the sprawling southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing.
He was married to a Chinese woman and had business interests in the country.
"Our embassy in Beijing and consulate general in Chongqing provided consular assistance to the family, as we would in any case involving a British national overseas," the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said.
He confirmed the dead man had business in China and said that for someone who supposedly died from an alcohol binge, in his experience Heywood was not a heavy drinker.
Heywood has been linked to the scandal and sacking of a man once seemingly destined for the heights of power in China.
In a country embracing capitalism, Bo cultivated an image as "redder than red."
The Wall Street Journal, quoting anonymous diplomatic sources close to the case, reports Wang clashed with Bo after raising his suspicions that Heywood had been poisoned.
After leaving the U.S. consulate, Wang was taken away by state police and has not seen or heard from since.
"This is a battle of the gods, not ordinary people," said one old man, who has seen leaders and revolution come and go.
And Heywood, found dead in a Chongqing hotel room, may still yet have a tale to tell.
