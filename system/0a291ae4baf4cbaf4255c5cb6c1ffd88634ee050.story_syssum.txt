BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Half of Iraq's registered voters turned out for peaceful provincial elections this weekend, the election commission said Sunday.
The highest turnout -- 65 percent -- was in the Salaheddin province in northern Iraq, the commission said.
CNN's Arwa Damon, who toured polling stations with U.N. observers, said she noticed an increased sense of awareness and optimism among voters, who said they felt their participation would have an impact on their lives and country.
Despite the heightened security, three mortars exploded near a polling station in central Tikrit, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of Baghdad, on Saturday morning, an official with the Interior Ministry told CNN.
In another incident in Tikrit, police detained four people wearing Iraqi police uniforms who they said had thrown stun grenades at voters outside a polling center.
