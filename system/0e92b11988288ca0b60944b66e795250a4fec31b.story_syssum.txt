Thomas says her brother "lives in survival mode" and nearly died after an altercation with a bouncer left him with a crushed sternum and broken foot, she says.
The group provides shelter, meals and other services daily to more than 400 homeless people in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
Thomas says Wolf has started on that path before.
About 13% of the adult homeless population are veterans.
Thomas says Wolf never saw combat; she suspects the life event that continues to haunt him was the sudden death of their mother.
When speaking of her brother, she seems quiet, respectful and a bit sad.
She says Wolf is a great guy, has always been a great guy, but he's never dealt with the reality of the havoc he's created.
"He's always sought attention, whether it's by telling a joke or leaving a cabinet door open while passing through the kitchen."
"My hope for him is to get clean and sober," she said, "then get help with his depression.
Have a simple conversation," she said.
