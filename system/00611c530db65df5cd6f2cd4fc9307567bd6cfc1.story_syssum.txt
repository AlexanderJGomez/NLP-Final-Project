The story started innocently enough before the bombshell was dropped by Christine R. Yano, an anthropologist at the University of Hawaii, who has delved more deeply than most into the Hello Kitty phenomenon.

For the record, Kitty's birthday is November 1, she likes baking and making pancakes, origami and eating apple pie.
She may have lost a few today.
