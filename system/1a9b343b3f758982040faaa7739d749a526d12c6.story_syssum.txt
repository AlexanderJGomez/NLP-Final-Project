(CNN) -- When it comes to the creatures most likely to be spotted swimming down London's River Thames, hippos will be far down the list.
Like several of Hofman's other pieces, "HippopoThames" was inspired by everyday objects -- in this case a children's book that the artist's parents gave him for their grandchild.
It's a process Hofman has used in the past, chiefly the enormous cuddly toys that formed his 2009 exhibition at The Hague and the ornament-like sparrow statues he created for Belgium's Rock Werchter music festival.
"I have a love of beautiful places -- both urban and rural, and I like to show them in their natural state," the artist explains.
Hofman claims an enormous yellow bunny he installed in the town of Orebro, Sweden, helped highlight a largely forgotten statue it was sited next to.
The West African country of Senegal also makes his list of favorites, as does the Swiss town of Bern, largely because of the way residents interact with its river in the summer.
"In those rare moments they enjoy life to the max and are more open to certain things.
Florentjin's own spare time on the sidelines of the London festival is likely to spent in one of the city's pubs, he says.
"After the rubber duck it was hard to come up with another water-related installation," he says.
