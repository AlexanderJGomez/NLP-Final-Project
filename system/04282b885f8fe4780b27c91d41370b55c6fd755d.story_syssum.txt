"As there is still a potential threat, even though reduced, a voluntary evacuation remains in place until the Army Corps of Engineers deems the lock stable and safe," the president and sheriff of St. Tammany Parish announced late Sunday morning.
But the waters were still rising Sunday afternoon.
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano visited the parish on Sunday, during a trip that also included stops in Mississippi where she met with that state's governor and other officials.
"Certainly, it helped some locations in our far eastern counties in Oklahoma, but there was very little beneficial rain," said Pete Snyder, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Tulsa.
But the northwestern city of Fayetteville, which is nearly 11 inches below its normal rainfall totals for the year, got just over an inch, Snyder said.
Officials were intentionally breaching levees in strategic areas in the parish, in hopes of getting "the bulk of this water out in five to seven days," Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser said Saturday.
Residents began returning home over the weekend in Helena, Mississippi, where National Guard troops rescued hundreds trapped by rising waters brought on by Isaac.
