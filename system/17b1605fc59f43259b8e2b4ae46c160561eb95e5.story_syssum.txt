LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Fires in central and southern California raged Saturday as triple-digit temperatures mixed with dry conditions continued to fuel the flames, torching thousands of acres and threatening scores of homes.
"Today what happened is what I called a perfect storm of fuels, weather and topography coming together ... essentially the fire burned at will," Mike Dietrich of the U.S. Forest Service said Saturday.
"Basically, all the homes that back up to the National Forest in the La Canada-Flintridge are in danger from the fire," Jorgensen said, adding that fire officials have told residents to be prepared for possible evacuation orders.
The blaze, called the Cottonwood fire, started Thursday afternoon about 10 miles from the southern California city of Hemet, officials reported.
Firefighters fully contained another fire that torched 230 acres about 20 miles southwest of downtown Los Angeles on Friday.
That fire was about 85 percent contained Friday evening, officials said.
