But at a press conference ahead of Chelsea's Champions League tie with Slovakian side MSK Zilina on Tuesday, Ancelotti said the rumors were "totally untrue".
"I have my contract until 2012 here in this club, I said a lot of times I would like to stay here, that I love this club, I love these players and have a lot of confidence in these players and this squad so there is no reason to change my idea.
"I said before my aim is to stay in this club, this country, this atmosphere for a long time.
"This moment is not so good on the pitch and we have to do better there, we have to stay in focus on this because this is the problem.
Sometimes the coach is in trouble because the team doesn't reach the results, but this is my life and I like this life."
