"Due to several consecutive years (the late '80s through the mid-'90s) of negligent and gross financial mismanagement, Dionne Warwick has realized the current necessity to file personal bankruptcy," Warwick publicist Kevin Sasaki said in a statement to CNN Tuesday.
"In light of the magnitude of her tax liabilities, Warwick has repeatedly attempted to offer repayment plans and proposals to the IRS and the California Franchise Tax Board for taxes owed," Sasaki said.
Her monthly income was listed at $20,950, although she is eligible for a pension from the SAG/AFTRA union, the filing said.
She has been touring in recent months, singing her hits for fans in Europe and South America, according to her website.
