The couple, who met through a Christian dating website, was enjoying an anniversary getaway and reportedly hiking in steep and rocky terrain when Toni Henthorn plunged 40 to 50 feet to her death, according to park officials and Toni Henthorn's family.
However, an autopsy showed Toni Henthorn died from multiple blunt force injuries after tumbling face first over a ledge "when she fell or was pushed down a cliff," the coroner wrote.
Henthorn was arrested outside his suburban Denver home without incident Thursday morning after dropping his daughter off at school, the culmination of a more than two-year investigation that involved the National Park Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Douglas County Sheriff's Office.
At that time, the couple was driving on a rural road about 10 miles outside Sedalia, Colorado, when Henthorn pulled over on a gravel shoulder to check a tire.
"We can only say that there is an open, active investigation into the death of his first wife," said Deborah Sherman, a spokeswoman for the Douglas County Sheriff's Office.
"I think if my sister had known the complete background on this guy, she never would have been with him," he added.
Bertolet questioned his sister's relationship with Henthorn, adding that he seemed like a very controlling person.
He is scheduled to be arraigned on the murder charge on November 12, which is also a detention hearing.
