According to the Chihuahua state attorney's office, the unidentified woman, with either hair dyed blond or wearing a blond wig, shot and killed a city bus driver identified as Jose Roberto Flores Carrera, 45, on August 28.
She reportedly says in the e-mails that her motive is retaliation against bus drivers who have raped vulnerable women, especially those who work in the "maquiladoras," or foreign assembly plants (mainly American) on the Mexican side of the border.
We're courageous and, if they don't show respect to us, we will make them respect us by our own means.
The slayings have terrorized many bus drivers, especially those operating Route 4, also known as the Yellow Route, which serves main thoroughfares and downtown Ciudad Juarez, a city of 1.5 million located across the border from El Paso, Texas.
"We're full of fear after learning this person killed two of our colleagues and nobody has any clue."
The victims, mainly young, single women, would disappear, their bodies later found in shallow graves in desert areas around the arid city.
