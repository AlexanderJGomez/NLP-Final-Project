(CNN) -- A severely disfigured woman received the nose, cheeks, upper jaw and facial tissue from a female cadaver in the first near-total face transplant in the United States, the woman's surgeon said Wednesday.

In the surgery, 80 percent of the woman's face was transplanted.
"Our hope is she should be able to smile again," said Dr. Frank A. Papay, chairman of the Dermatology and Plastic Surgery Institute at the Cleveland Clinic.
She said it has taken 20 years of research and four years to find the right patient who understood the risks involved.
The transplant recipient has to take immune-suppressing drugs for the rest of his or her life to prevent rejection of the donated tissue.
In the past three years, facial transplants have been completed in France and China, but these cases have raised medical and ethical questions.
In 2007, a French team performed the third partial facial transplant on a man who was disfigured by a genetic disorder that created large tumors on his face.
The facial transplants in France and China generated much controversy as questions arose about whether the patients were adequately vetted and informed about the risks.
Bioethicist Dr. Arthur Caplan, chairman of the University of Pennsylvania's Medical Ethics Department, said Wednesday on CNN's "American Morning" that he initially had similar qualms about the facial transplant, which improves the quality of a life rather than saving it, but was gradually convinced.
At the news conference Wednesday, Kodish said the transplant had "abundant moral justification": the face as a personal embodiment as self.
"She gave a thumbs up, first indication she was comfortable," said Dr. Chad Gordon, a fellow at the clinic's department of plastic surgery.
