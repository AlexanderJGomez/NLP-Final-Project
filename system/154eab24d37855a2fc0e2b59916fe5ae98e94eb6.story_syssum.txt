(CNN) -- Cyprus has become the latest eurozone nation to apply for a bailout amid a financial crisis linked to debt defaults in Greece.
When a struggling Greece was allowed to let some of its private bond holders take a loss -- a "haircut" -- Cypriot banks lost money and needed refinancing.
Under the original Eurogroup proposal on March 16, all holders of bank accounts in Cyprus -- both residents and non-residents -- would have been required to pay a one-off tax on their existing deposits.
A government spokesman later said Cyprus' president had "fought hard" to exclude deposits of under â‚¬100,000 from the levy "which was imposed in order to blackmail Cyprus by those who are today trying to justify their own decisions."
In trying to convince Cypriots to support the EU deal, President Nicos Anastasiades warned that the alternative --- bankruptcy, exit from the euro and devaluation -- would be even more painful.
CNNMoney said developments are being closely watched because of the potential to destabilize financial markets in Europe; there are also concerns that other financially weak nations might fear similar bailout provisions in the future.
In 2001, the IMF released a report on bank debit taxes that had been imposed in Latin America -- however, these taxes were on financial transactions not an outright grab as is being proposed in Cyprus.
He said failure to agree to the package would "lead to disorderly bankruptcy as a result of the decision of the European Central Bank to immediately discontinue the provision of emergency assistance to preserve the liquidity of the two large banks."
This would mean depositors will lose access to their deposits, and a large number will face significant losses, he said.
CNN's Ratlisa Vassileva said Russia's government was angry not to have been consulted on the proposal and its finance minister had said the issue would factor in any decision the country made on restructuring its multi-billion dollar loan to Cyprus.
