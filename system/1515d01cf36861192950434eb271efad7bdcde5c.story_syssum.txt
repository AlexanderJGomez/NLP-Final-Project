(CNN) -- The Las Conchas fire in New Mexico swelled to 92,735 acres burned Thursday, and strong winds threatened to be firefighters' greatest challenge moving in to the fifth day battling the flames.
"What I witnessed today was an incredibly professional job by men and women who are risking their lives to save our community and this laboratory," Charles McMillan, the lab director, said Wednesday.
If the fire should get too close to the drums, firefighters were ready to use foam to ensure that nothing would be released into the environment, he said.
The Las Conchas Fire touches the south border of the lab's 40-square-mile facility, and comes close to the west border, according to Tucker.
Susana Martinez warned citizens to avoid using fireworks on the July Fourth holiday and the rest of the season.
The Pacheco Fire continues to burn in the Pecos Wilderness, two miles north of the Santa Fe Ski Basin.
