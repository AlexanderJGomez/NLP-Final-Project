The reunions of about 100 people from each country are scheduled to take place between February 20 and 25, the South Korean unification ministry said Wednesday, following face-to-face talks between the two sides.
If they go ahead, the meetings of divided Korean families would be the first to take place since 2010.
The drills infuriate North Korea, which says it sees them as a prelude to an invasion.
This month's planned reunions are scheduled to take place at the site where previous ones were held: Mount Kumgang, a resort on the North Korean side of the border that used to be jointly operated by both sides.
