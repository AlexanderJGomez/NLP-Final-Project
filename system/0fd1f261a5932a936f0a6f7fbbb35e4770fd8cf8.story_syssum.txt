Today, Luna and Bernal's on-screen chemistry has once again grabbed the public's attention, this time in Mexico, where their latest film "Rudo y Cursi" made box-office history.
It was written written and directed by Carlos Cuaron, and is the first release from groundbreaking new production venture Cha Cha Cha films.
Cuaron also cast Bernal and Luna -- best friends since childhood in Mexico City who were so keen to do the film the signed up before they saw a script -- against type and against their wishes.
Both had originally wanted to play the opposite character: Bernal the abrasive Rudo, and Luna the romantic Cursi.
The venture formalizes a working relationship del Toro, Innaritu and Alfonso Cuaron have had for years, but they freely admit they spend little time together.
For del Toro, the company will extend the influence of Mexican cinema not diminish it: "We want to give Mexican cinema, if you want to call it that, the credentials and right to exist in world cinema.
The bittersweet drama has played to big laughs all over Mexico and the U.S., but for its makers, it is not simply a comedy.
Failure though, is not an issue overly burdening Cha Cha Cha's "three amigos," -- their second film, "Biutiful," set in Barcelona, directed by Inarritu and starring Javier Bardem is currently being edited in Spain.
"No, not my mother," says the director.
