Tairee, a student at the University of Ghana, is proud to wear traditional beads.
"People can actually wear them on their necks and as parts of their clothing.
"There's a culture of 'sankofa:' Go back and retrieve what you've left behind," said bead-shop owner Ernestina Anafu.
He told CNN that beads were once exchanged for slaves, alcoholic drinks, and textiles.
The Ghanaian government has recognized the potential of the bead industry as a tourist attraction and in foreign trade.
But the new-found popularity of beads isn't just about giving old materials a new lease of life -- it's about breathing new life into traditional ideas.
Where I'm from, if you wear something like blue it's purity, white is fertility, gold is wealth.
