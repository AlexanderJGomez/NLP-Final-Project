And it led me, after all these years, to the legendary Barbara Hearn.
Oddly, his voice is not heard out in the restaurant itself.
The other night I was eating at the restaurant and, of course, Elvis was singing in the men's room.
She was Elvis's hometown girlfriend in Memphis at the beginning of 1956, just before his career hit the stratosphere.
A closer inspection of the handwriting revealed that she was saying she had dined at another BrickTop's, in Nashville, Tennessee.
I did -- at the Holly Tree Manor Bed and Breakfast in Trenton, Tennessee, which she and her husband of 50 years, Jim Smith, own and run.
He told me he'd had copies made of the photo, and ordered that they be put in nice frames and hung in the men's and women's restrooms of all his restaurants.
He said that the nonstop Elvis songs do not discriminate by gender: They are in the women's rooms as well as in the men's rooms.
But back to Barbara Hearn: She said she first met Elvis when she was working at Goldsmith's Department Store in Memphis with a friend named Dixie Locke, who was dating Presley.
There is a famous photograph, taken by Alfred Wertheimer inside the home on Audubon Drive in Memphis that Presley shared with his parents (this was pre-Graceland).
I was dressed to go out with him for the evening, all gussied up.
And what we're doing is, he had just taken the train back from New York, where he had recorded some new songs for RCA Victor.
Soon enough he went to Hollywood; by the end of that year, he would be bringing Natalie Wood to Memphis to meet his parents.
And now, more than half a century later, there they are, in the restaurant restrooms, accompanied by the sound of his voice.
