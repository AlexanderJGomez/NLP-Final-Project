Few women hold land titles, and as a result, many don't have the necessary collateral to secure funding from a bank.
Like many of the women she helps, Kisyombe struggled to get financing when first starting out.
If a woman could have a cow like I had, she could have an asset that could generate income, then we could go around the problem of not being able to access financing."
By offering loans to women in a range of industries, SELFINA is effecting change throughout Tanzania, though Kisyombe envisions the women she supports will have a global impact.
Ultimately, she sees SELFINA encouraging women in a broader context than business.
The key to empowerment, Kisyombe believes, is education, and to that end, she raised money to build the Mukuza Girl's Secondary School in Dar Es Salaam.
