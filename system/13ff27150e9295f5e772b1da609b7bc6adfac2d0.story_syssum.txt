Phillips' longtime kidney issues plagued his run on "Idol," causing him excruciating pain and preventing him from participating in various "Idol" duties, like the weekly Ford music video shoots.
In March, Phillips, who suffers a congenital kidney condition, underwent a surgical procedure to have a stent implanted into his kidney to prevent blockage -- thereby assuring he could remain a competing contestant.
Phillips was reportedly scheduled to go under the knife last week, but due to a fever and sinus infection, the surgery had to be delayed.
Our get-well-soon wishes go out to Phillip; he's got a whole lot of fans hoping to hear him sing again soon.
