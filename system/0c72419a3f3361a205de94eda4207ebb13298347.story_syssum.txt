Travolta testified for the second time in a case against paramedic Tarino Lightbourne and former Bahamian Sen.
In earlier testimony, one of Travolta's lawyers, Allyson Maynard-Gibson, said Bridgewater approached her in the days after the January 2 death of Jett, saying she had a legal client who had a document Travolta might want.
In testimony last week, Travolta said a nanny found Jett unresponsive at the home on the island of Grand Bahamas, where the family was spending their New Year's holiday.
The paramedic, however, asked Travolta to sign a statement releasing the ambulance company from liability.
Travolta said that while he and his wife were riding in the ambulance with their son, they decided to divert to the hospital.
One of the actor's attorneys, Michael McDermott, took the witness stand Wednesday afternoon and began testimony about a videotaped meeting between him and one of the defendants.
