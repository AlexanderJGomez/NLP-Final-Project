New York (CNN) -- The first 13 rules of basketball sold Friday for more than $4 million, setting a record for the highest sales price for sports memorabilia, according to Sotheby's, which conducted the auction.
The first game was played with nine players on each team and a soccer ball they lobbed into peach baskets secured about 10 feet off the floor on either end of a gymnasium.
"As soon as they create a venue to house it and persuade us that they will maintain it, we will give them the papers," said Booth, who has an undergraduate degree from the school.
"It is an incredibly important document," he said.
At Kansas, Allen, in turn, coached other legendary basketballers: Dean Smith, head coach at the University of North Carolina for 36 years, and Adolph Rupp, head coach at the University of Kentucky for 42 years.
After Naismith's death in 1939, the family held onto the 13 rules of the game in a safe deposit box at various locations.
The family has always been involved in the game of basketball, but after many offers, it is "time to move forward," said Naismith, now living outside Chicago.
The proceeds from the auction will go to the James Naismith International Basketball Foundation.
