Video of Glenn Taylor shoving the huge rock off a slender pedestal where its rested for millions of years went viral online and prompted media scrutiny.
The attention has led to revelations that Taylor filed a personal-injury lawsuit in September, claiming he had suffered "serious, permanent and debilitating injuries" from a 4-year-old car crash.
"But instead, they think no one will ever see it or repercussions will ever come of it," Cevallos said.
Some little kid was about ready to walk down here and die and Glenn saved his life by getting the boulder out of the way.
"Obviously, we're very concerned and upset that somebody would come and destroy this natural wonder that took millions of years to be formed," he told KUTV.
"I wish we would have been smart enough to go get a ranger 'cause it was wrong of us to be vigilantes, and I'm sorry I did that," he told CNN affiliate KSTU.
There seems to be a lot of happiness and joy with the individuals doing this, and it's not right.
