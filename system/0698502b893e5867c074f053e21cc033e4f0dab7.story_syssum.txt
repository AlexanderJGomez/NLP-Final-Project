Those who are born into this family don't want to leave this tradition so we just keep growing and growing," he says with a smile.
Ziona's father, Chana, founded the Christian sect in Baktwang village that promotes polygamy as God's will.
The main room is a giant hall where the family cooks, eats and prays.
Without much fuss, while some women of the house cook, others set the table, still others serve and clean.
Like a well-oiled machine, everyone carries out their individual chore, so dinner for 160 is ready within an hour and utensils are washed and put away within minutes.
"No fighting, never, we are all one family, there's no other people here so we don't fight," says sixth grandson Hmingthamzauva, one of the few in the household who speaks English.
There is no rule or tradition as such that we have to follow polygamy, for me it's actually unbearable," Hmingtahmzauva says.
"My father is the greatest god that we can have in this world, he has done so much for us," says his eldest son Nunparliana, who has two wives and 14 children.
The family is not listed in the Guinness Book of World Records because Ziona says he doesn't want the publicity.
But as word gets out, Baktwang village and Ziona's family may not remain so isolated.
