(CNN)  -- She had come alone to the Richmond High School homecoming dance, gorgeous in a sparkling purple dress and faux diamond baubles.
According to police, she had been gang raped and beaten for almost 2Â½ hours and left unconscious under a bench shortly before midnight Saturday night.
"The officers -- not only did they not check the IDs of those students or men sitting outside of of our campus, but the security officers who are employed here did no ... checking either.
Baker took the podium with her younger sister, Barbie, a freshman at the school, who had spent a chunk of Saturday evening with the rape victim.
Cody Ray Smith, described by the court as over 14 years old, pleaded not guilty to charges of rape with a foreign object and rape by force.
Another adult who was arrested has a different court date.
The victim was released from a hospital Wednesday, police said.
