Unlike a lava flow that is currently destroying homes in Hawaii, however, the lava in Iceland is flowing in an uninhabited area and has only provided stunning visual effects that have been captured by many photographers.
So far, however, the eruption has not caused any problems from ash clouds because it is erupting beyond the ice cap.
There are hundreds of metres of ice within the caldera, so any eruption would lead to the production of ash, once it melts its way through the ice cap; melting ice interacts with the magma, turning to steam and exploding the magma into fragments of ash.
This means that aircraft are now allowed to fly in areas containing low particle concentrations, and various efforts such as a collaboration of 26 European institutes called FUTUREVOLC, mean that models of ash concentration have been much improved since 2010.
The weather at the time also conspired against civil air authorities and travellers, with dry air and consistent northerly winds causing the ash to spread deep into Europe.
Taken overall, there remains a possibility of a significant ash eruption in Iceland that may well impact some flights.
However, despite all the risks, it is still unlikely we will witness a repeat of the travel chaos that brought European airspace to a standstill in 2010.
