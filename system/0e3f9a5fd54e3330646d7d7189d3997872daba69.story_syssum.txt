Amid the traffic and blast of our horns, the sound of Rena's struggle to breathe was clear.
The bullet had entered her mouth cleanly but had torn up the other side of her mouth.
Dar Al'Shifa is in rebel territory where medical supplies are exhausted and hard to replenish.
In Rena's case, she could not get the surgery on her face she clearly needed there, so the doctors dared to think the unthinkable, and sent her across the front lines to the better equipped government hospital.
These buildings are inside rebel territory, but snipers -- particularly those working for the infamous pro-government militia known as the Shabeeha -- are thought to work inside rebel-held areas, and few could explain why the Free Syrian Army would shoot into areas that were sympathetic to it.
