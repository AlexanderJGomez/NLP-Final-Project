Flanked by a heavy police presence, the Chinese demonstrators marching past the embassy were vocal but orderly, shouting that the disputed islands belong to China.
Meanwhile, on the disputed islands, two Japanese men carried out a small-scale protest of their own Tuesday when they jumped from a fishing boat and swam to shore, spending a short amount of time on land, the Japanese Coast Guard reported.
China reasserted that claim last week, sending ships to patrol the area after the Japanese government announced it would buy several of the islands from a Japanese family.
And the ocean floor may hold as much as 100 billion barrels of oil, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, as well abundant natural gas reserves that the Chinese are already seeking to tap.
A total of 11 Chinese government ships were near the islands on Tuesday afternoon, the Japanese Coast Guard said, adding that it had warned the vessels not to enter Japanese territorial waters.
Washington is Japan's leading military ally and China's leading trade partner, and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has called on both sides to resolve the dispute peacefully during a visit to the region this week.
A public initiative begun in April this year by the outspoken governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, to raise money to acquire the islands for the city authorities set off a new cycle of tensions that included civilian protesters from both sides landing on the islands to stake their nations' claims.
But by Saturday night, China's state-run media had started appealing for restraint, running commentaries that condemned violence and lectured the public on the expression of patriotism.
