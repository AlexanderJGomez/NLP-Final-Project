A Michigan referee of an adult-league soccer match died Tuesday, two days after being punched in the head by a player, authorities said.
"John Bieniewicz was a man who lived life to the fullest," friends wrote on a website dedicated to his memory.
The investigation is ongoing and authorities "anticipate the criminal charges to be modified as a result of Mr. Bieniewicz's death," police said.
"He also took a particular interest in all the children he worked with Monday thru Friday at the pediatric dialysis center at Mott, and reveled in their improvement and happiness," the site said.
A judge ordered the teenager, who was not named publicly, to keep a picture of Portillo in his cell for the remainder of his time in juvenile jail.
