"House of Cards," which helped establish Netflix as an original programmer -- rather than those folks who send you DVDs in red envelopes -- returns Friday for its second season.
It's a long way from the beginning of the first season, when Underwood was denied his desired job as secretary of state.
As Underwood noted in the very first episode as he put a wounded dog out of its misery, "I have no patience for useless things."
The writer and producer observes that one of the character's models is Lyndon Johnson, known for his shrewd knowledge of the legislative process both as a senator and as president.
Naturally, Willimon and his stars have been tight-lipped about how far Underwood will take things in a show The Kansas City Star nicknamed "Mr. Macbeth Goes to Washington."
There's a suggestion that Underwood could be implicated in a murder investigation.
In the first season's early episodes, she seemed more troubled by unethical behavior than her husband; after all, she was a lobbyist for environmental issues.
In return, the show was nominated for eight Emmy awards last fall, winning three, and Netflix's subscriber base and stock price have both hit new highs.
"There are people who don't like the level of darkness, who find the characters unsympathetic," he told the Times Magazine.
