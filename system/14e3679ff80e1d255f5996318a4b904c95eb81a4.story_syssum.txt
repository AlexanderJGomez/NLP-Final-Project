When doctors told him he had five tennis rackets in his hotel room, he couldn't say why.
When they showed him photos of himself with others, he didn't recognize them, or himself.
Today, the 61-year-old man says he has come to terms with the name "Michael Boatwright," but only because doctors told him he should.
Among the IDs police discovered on him was one from the Department of Veterans Affairs.
In an essay he wrote for the site, he mentioned he worked as an English instructor in Japan for 10 years, and that he was married to a Japanese woman.
Photos found with Boatwright in the motel room showed a young man living in what looked like a European city, not Asia.
Boatwright often used the screen name 'korstemplar' and listed himself as a Swede living and teaching in China.
They either went to voice mail or no one picked up, the newspaper said.
He doesn't have any independent knowledge of his life before he woke up in the hospital.
That would certainly explain the five rackets in his hotel room.
The relatively rare disorder often goes away on its own, but it can take several months.
"They said he was getting depressed because he wasn't able to communicate," said Linda Kosvic, chairman of the Vasa Order of America chapter in San Jacinto, California.
The hospital would like to discharge Boatwright, but they have no place to send him, said Richard Ramhoff, a spokesman for Desert Regional Medical Center.
