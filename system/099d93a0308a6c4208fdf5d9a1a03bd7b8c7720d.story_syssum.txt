(CNN) -- The fourteenth suspicious fire in a month's time hit a small community near Philadelphia before dawn Sunday.
In a statement, Coatesville City Manager Harry Walker said the declaration would allow him to "promulgate whatever special rules and regulations necessary to protect" citizens.
Standing outside the latest blaze early Sunday, resident Janet Jackson said it had broken out just behind her house.
"Must have been like 15-foot flames or higher," he said.
Referring to suggestions that the fires may be the result of gang activity, Rivera said, "If it's a gang, please stop, and find something else to do.
"I never thought Coatesville would be on the map for something like this," she added.
The fires do not appear to follow a clear pattern, she said.
Coatesville, about 45 miles west of Philadelphia, has about 11,000 residents, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
