Russia had looked set for a second successive victory that would have sealed their place in the last eight, thanks to Alan Dzagoev's third goal of the tournament.
The Czechs, needing a response following their 4-1 defeat to Russia, got off to a remarkably fast start.
Either way, as it had been in their first game against Poland, Greece's first-half luck was completely out.
The victory means Bilak's Czech side now have three points from two Group A games, but leaves Greece knowing that only a win against Russia in their final group game will give them any chance of reaching the knockout stages.
The co-hosts made a lively start and the impressive Robert Lewandowski saw a crisp left-foot strike fly just over before Eugen Polanski had a goal disallowed for offside.
Malafeev had no chance with that strike but rescued his side on three other occasions to ensure that Russia stay top of Group A -- but with everything to play for in Saturday's final round of group matches.
