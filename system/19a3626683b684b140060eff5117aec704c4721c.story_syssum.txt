(CNN) -- Andre and Korisha Shipley were still mourning the death of their 17-year-old son, Jesse, when two months after his funeral, they received shocking news from students of the same Staten Island, New York, high school Jesse had attended.
The couple are now suing the city for the emotional distress caused by the handling of their son's remains.
He says it is common practice for medical examiners in the U.S. to save the brain and certain other organs when they think it's important.
Weedn says the brain is preserved for at least two weeks in a formula that firms the matter enough for the coroner to examine it, a process necessary to rule out suspicion and to maintain evidence for cases when the death is determined to be the result of criminal activity.
He says most people recognize the duty of medical examiners to rule out crime, but that does not justify keeping organs.
He says in situations where an autopsy has been performed and a bereaved family is concerned whether all the remains have been returned, it is usually up to the family to ask.
Still, Weedn says, in some circumstances it is not beneficial to ask family, because the person of you ask permission could potentially be connected to the cause of death.
Perhaps what's most extraordinary in the Jesse Shipley case is that the family did find out through the serendipitous field trip students from Jesse's high school took the morgue.
Dr. Cyril H. Wecht, a forensic pathologist and attorney who reviews cases like these but is not involved in the Shipley case, says the medical examiner was right to take out the brain for investigation but was wrong to openly display Shipley's name on it.
"For them, whenever they remember their child, part of their memory is holding a jar of organs in their hands that they never should have known existed," he explains.
