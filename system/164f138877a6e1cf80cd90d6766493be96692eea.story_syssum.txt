Bamako, Mali (CNN) -- Islamists in control of northern Mali said they forced a man and a woman into two holes and stoned them to death for committing adultery in the lawless region.
The stoning Sunday is the first reported Sharia killing since al Qaeda-linked Islamists took control of the north.
Ethnic Tuareg rebels and Islamist militants have taken advantage of the chaos to seize control of the northern portion of the country.
"The fact that we are building a new country on the base of Sharia is just something the people living here will have to accept."
Two months prior, elderly men kept watch over the main library after Islamists burned a different tomb in another attack in the same town.
