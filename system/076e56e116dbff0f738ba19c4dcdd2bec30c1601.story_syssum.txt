"Maybe sometimes people might think it's a good idea (for a celebrity's image) ... but most of the time it's a genuine interest," Krim said.
I'm a lawyer and ... in 2003 I met a lot of celebrities and reality stars in social circles who were wanting to give back but didn't know how ...
Maybe sometimes people might thing it's a good idea (for their image) ... but most of the time it's a genuine interest... in fact, there's a lot of celebrities who do charity work who don't even want cameras around.
But then again, I have just as much respect for those who want to promote it because they set an example for other celebrities.
I think it's great, (top celebrities like) Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Angelina Jolie, do amazing work ... but I think it's important to highlight other great things by young Hollywood, Sophia Bush from "One Tree Hill" ... Serinda Swan from "Breakout Kings," Ian Somerhalder from the "Vampire Diaries" cast ... people might not realize it's not just the A-listers who are philanthropic, it's everyone from young Hollywood.
Krim: I would say the best example of that might be Soulja Boy, who has gotten a lot of flak (he was recently arrested for gun and drug charges) ... he just came to my Children's Miracle Network event... he loves kids and he's all about giving back.
It's a win-win and there' s nothing better than seeing a smile on a kid's face... when you surprise them with their favorite celebrity.
