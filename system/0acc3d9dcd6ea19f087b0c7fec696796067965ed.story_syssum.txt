Chesapeake Cares Food Pantry, located 30 miles from the political impasse in Washington that resulted in the shutdown, put together a food giveaway tailored to affected workers not at their jobs and not being paid.
Robert Hahn, the head End Hunger in Calvert County, a consortium of food pantries in the area.
Men and women were on both sides of the help on Monday in Calvert County -- those receiving and those distributing food.
Those helping out included one person who works for the Department of Justice and another employed by the Navy.
"They're here contributing and giving back to the community and I think that shows the kind of spirit that we have among all kinds of federal workers all across the country, people who dedicate their lives to public service," Obama said.
Hahn, who has worked for Chesapeake Church for 20 years, said many of the men and women he saw collect food on Monday were new faces who had never sought their help in the past.
"I would say this to the president and Congress, your job is to solve problems, not to create problems," Hahn said.
