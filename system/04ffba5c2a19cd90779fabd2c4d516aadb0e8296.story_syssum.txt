The Affordable Care Act strengthened the Medicare system that this growing senior population relies on.
A vital home care work force has developed to meet these needs, and its interests are inextricably bound to the future of health care.
The work force can barely meet the current need for care, supports and services, let alone what's to come.
Of course, the Supreme Court justices have lifetime appointments that include access to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, one of the largest insurance pools in the country, which ensures the jurists aren't subject to the sorts of limits for pre-existing conditions and inflated premiums that most insured Americans have long faced.
With our senior population growing by the second, or every eight seconds to be exact, we need to move forward quickly toward more improvements, not roll back the ones we've made.
But if the justices would just think of themselves as senior citizens and soon-to-be-seniors, they would uphold the Affordable Care Act for the sake of older Americans, care workers and our shared future.
