The screen diva -- dubbed the Julia Roberts of Africa -- has starred in dozens of films, enchanting millions of movie fans across the continent.
CNN's Pedro Pinto caught up with Nnaji before her latest movie premiere in London to discuss fame and her passion for Nigeria.
GN: I like that as Nigerians we have some sort of neighborly love that we don't understand.
I can work anywhere else but in terms of living, I'm used to Lagos.
I don't think I saw myself there but somehow...here we are, I am an actor.
GN: Thanks to Oprah (Winfrey), it's very, very flattering, I mean not just because I'm compared to (Roberts) but because of who compared me to her.
GN: I want to be further challenged in my career, I don't think I have reached my peak necessarily so I hope for other opportunities, greater opportunities to express myself.
