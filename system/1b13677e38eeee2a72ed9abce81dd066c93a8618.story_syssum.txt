A second defendant, Mounir Rarmoul-Bouhadjar, has pleaded guilty to one count of possessing a document that could be used in a terror attack, also on an SD card hidden between an iPhone and its case.
Incedal and Bouhadjar communicated via email and Skype using code words and aliases to refer to the words "Kalashnikov" and "Mumbai style," the prosecution said.
More than 160 people were killed in November 2008 when 10 Pakistani gunmen associated with the terror group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba stormed buildings in Mumbai, India.
