(CNN) -- Nearly one in four people worldwide is Muslim -- and they are not necessarily where you might think, according to an extensive new study that aims to map the global Muslim population.
The Middle East and north Africa, which together are home to about one in five of the world's Muslims, trail a very distant second.
"When it comes to issues of outreach to the Muslim world, these numbers will indicate that outreach cannot be focused so narrowly on the Middle East," he said.
"If the goal is to create better understanding between the United States and the Muslim world, our focus should be on south and southeast Asia, not the Middle East," he said.
"There are these countries that we don't think of as Muslim at all, and yet they have very sizable numbers of Muslims," said Alan Cooperman, the associate director of research for the Pew Forum, naming India, Russia and China.
The Pew researchers concluded that Nigeria is just over half Muslim, making it the sixth most populous Muslim country in the world.
They warned they were less confident of those numbers than of the general population figures because sectarian data is harder to come by.
One in three of the world's Shiite Muslims lives in Iran, which is one of only four countries with a Shiite majority, he said.
"This is no way reflects the religiosity of people, only their self-identification," Grim said.
