Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The failed computer system that caused flight delays across the country has been restored, the Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday.
Carmen McDonald was among those passengers inconvenienced by flight delays when the computerized system that airlines use to file flight plans failed for several hours Thursday in Atlanta, Georgia, and Salt Lake City, Utah.

At Indianapolis International Airport, most morning flights left on time with little impact from the computer glitch, but inbound flights from large hubs are expected to be delayed Thursday and possibly into Friday, said spokeswoman Susan Sullivan.
The FAA said the information in the network is data required to launch planes expeditiously.
