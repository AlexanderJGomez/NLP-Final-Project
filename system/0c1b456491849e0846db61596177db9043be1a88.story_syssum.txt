In a statement aired on a private Libyan television channel, one of the three main Zintan groups in Tripoli said that at least two members of the force defending positions at the airport were killed in a rocket attack.
Still the government on Tuesday called for an immediate halt to the fighting and for the militias to withdraw within a week at least 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the airport.
A resident who lives near the airport told CNN families in the area are fearful they will be killed or injured by what appears to them as indiscriminate shelling.
The damage to the planes, many of which belong to the two national airlines, is in the hundreds of millions of dollars, the government said.
The United Nations, which stood by the Libyan people in their revolution in 2011, will not abandon them as they seek to build a democratic state."
All flights in and out of the airport have been suspended.
The international community has largely agreed that the key to resolving Libya's crisis is national dialogue.
"We affirm our support for Libya's democratic transition and urge the seating of the new Council of Representatives as soon as possible," the statement added.
