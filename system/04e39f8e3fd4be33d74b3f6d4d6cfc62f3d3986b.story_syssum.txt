The police dashcam video, released Friday, shows Cottonwood Police approaching the group of eight people -- all identified as members of the Gaver family -- around a large SUV in a Walmart parking lot on March 21.
On the video, an officer tells the group that they "need to separate these folks and talk to them."
Police say pepper spray was deployed and that at least three shots were fired in an apparent struggle for an officer's gun.
At least three members of the family are reportedly in a Christian band named "Matthew 24 Now," which is a Bible verse that refers to the end times, according to CNN affiliate KPHO.
