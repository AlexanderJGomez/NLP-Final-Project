And for his literary team, there is the painful dilemma of what to do with an unpublished manuscript.
The idea that "The Labyrinth of Osiris" could be his last book is all the more poignant, because reviewers and editors alike say it's his best -- even Sussman agreed.
Promoting a book without an author presents unique challenges -- especially because Sussman took such an active role in publicizing his work.
"In some ironic way, it (his death) got a little bit more attention for the book in the UK," says Morgan Entrekin, president of Grove/Atlantic, Sussman's U.S. publisher, "as people wrote about the tragedy of his death and the fact that this was going to be his last book."
She says she yearns to talk to him each time she finds one of the inside jokes he scatters throughout "The Labyrinth of Osiris."
She then makes a gruesome discovery when she loses her footing and falls down a shaft.
She tells him about his two sons, ages 5 and 3, and what she's up to around their London home.
She has a treasure trove of material that she can turn to when she wants to remember his voice.
It's the story of a 100-year-old man who decides to kill himself, because he thinks he's lived long enough.
His literary team also worries that introducing a new work too soon after his latest crime thriller's release could distract readers from the marketing campaign around his existing books.
The adjunct associate professor at Columbia Business School finds plenty of upsides to bringing out new material from an author who has passed away.
As they mull over sharing his unpublished work with the world, his colleagues and friends find that Sussman lives on through his books.
She says she would also be keen to publish her husband's early manuscript -- in time.
