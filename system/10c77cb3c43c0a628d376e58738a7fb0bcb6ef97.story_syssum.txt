"The New York Wheel will be an attraction unlike any other in New York City -- even unlike any other on the planet," Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an enthusiastic advocate, said in a news release.
The wheel passed one of its final hurdles before it can begin construction when the New York City Planning Commission voted unanimously Wednesday for its approval.
When opened, both wheels would best Asia's "Singapore Flyer," which at 541 feet is the largest wheel in operation.
Marin tells CNN the designer of his wheel is working on an even bigger one in Dubai.
