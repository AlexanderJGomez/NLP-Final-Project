(CNN)In the gentle yet fiercely warm surrounds of the southern Ugandan countryside, Mwanja Banuli looks on as farmhands fill his truck with sugar cane.
This particular batch is headed for Kakira Sugar Limited -- one of the country's oldest and largest factories.
"What you see in the background is the first mill that was installed in 1930 to crush only 150 tons of cane," explains Kenneth Barungi, assistant general manager of Kakira at the site of the company's nearby factory.
The often erratic Amin praised Hitler and said the German dictator "was right to burn six million Jews."
After almost 50 years, the Madhvanis were no longer welcome in Uganda.
Even if you imported the machinery you didn't have technical expertise here to run such industries."
"There was no longer a sugar plantation, the houses were occupied by anybody.
The Madhvanis quickly borrowed money from the World Bank and the African Development Bank and set about rebuilding their business.
They farm the lands neighboring the plantations and are contracted to Kakira, supplying 70% of its sugarcane needs.
"I used to work as a casual laborer for other people in the community digging in their gardens to get some income.
The excess can go and work in other industries in the country," Barungi said.
