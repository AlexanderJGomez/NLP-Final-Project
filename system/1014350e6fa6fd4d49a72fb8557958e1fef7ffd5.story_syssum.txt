The Benham brothers were the planned stars of the HGTV show "Flip It Forward," set to premiere in October, in which they would have helped families purchase homes they otherwise could not afford.
An April press release described the planned show this way: "After a decade of flipping houses for profit, brothers David Benham and Jason Benham now help families buy the homes they never thought they could afford.
"We've been running a successful real estate company for the last 11 years and we help all people.
And that's really what the point of this is -- is that there is an agenda that is seeking to silence the voices of men and women of faith," he added.
Our faith is the fundamental calling in our lives, and the centerpiece of who we are.
"Over the last decade, we've sold thousands of homes with the guiding principle of producing value and breathing life into each family that has crossed our path, and we do not, nor will we ever discriminate against people who do not share our views.
The organization Faith Driven Consumer, which started a campaign in support of Phil Robertson of "Duck Dynasty," has launched #FlipThisDecision, a petition aimed at reinstating the HGTV show.
