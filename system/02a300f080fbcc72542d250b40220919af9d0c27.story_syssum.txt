Shaker Masri, a 28-year old U.S. citizen, pleaded guilty to attempting to provide material support for Al-Shabaab, a group he knew the United States had designated as a foreign terrorist organization, according to prosecutors.
Masri explained that they would be traveling to a part of southern Somalia that was controlled by Al-Shabaab and said "he expected that they would be placed with a brigade of al-Shabaab's militia comprised of foreign fighters."
Masri also told his associate that he needed to get rid of his laptop because it had information that could be incriminating, and buy a new one.
Earlier in his case Masri also was charged with attempting or conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction outside the United States.
