Washington (CNN) -- Investigators have uncovered no evidence to suggest a Maryland man taken in custody after allegedly threatening his workplace had acquired weapons illegally, a law enforcement official said Saturday.
Police say the suspect in last Friday's shooting inside a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, where the film was being shown, identified himself afterward to police as "the Joker."
"An individual who was in the process of being fired was involved in two separate conversations with his supervisor," Prince George's County Police Chief Mark Magaw told reporters.
Magaw said that, given Pitney Bowes' status as a federal contractor, the man could be subject to federal charges.
