It's crazy -- she was slim, but that was her natural physique," Monjack told PEOPLE.
During a sometimes tear-filled interview, an exhausted Monjack, 39, who hasn't slept since his mother-in-law found his wife collapsed in the bathroom early Sunday, said all he knows is what doctors told him at the hospital: She died of cardiac arrest, but they won't know details until after an autopsy.
"She was on herbal remedies that wouldn't speed up her heart," Monjack said.
Asked point-blank if a drug overdose was a possible cause of death, Monjack replied, "I can get rid of that one right now," he said.
"One of the saddest things is that Clara has looked everywhere for Brittany and can't find her," said Monjack.
"So many people have their views of us, but they never met us or sat down with us," he said.
Her big dream next year was to have a child, and we talked about how he or she would look.
I wish I could show all the receipts from the take out restaurants," he said.
"I know there was a disparity in how we looked and I'm no movie star, but she always saw the person."
"I don't know if she will ever recover, and I know when she reads all this nonsense about her son-in-law and her deceased daughter, her heart is breaking.
I hope she stays -- I can't imagine my life without Sharon -- she's my link to Brittany."
