The Movement for Democratic Change nominated Bennett to be deputy minister of agriculture in a national unity government with President Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF party, which has ruled the country since independence in 1980.
Bennett will appear in the Mutare magistrate's court on Monday, his lawyer Trust Maanda told CNN.
The swearing-in eventually took place but was delayed, the MDC said, because Mugabe and his ZANU-PF party wanted to appoint more ministers than they were allowed in the new government.
The stalemate lasted for more than an hour, until Mugabe's party agreed that only 17 of their proposed ministers take office.
