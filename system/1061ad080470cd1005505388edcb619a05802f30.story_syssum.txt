NEW YORK (CNN) -- Ben Folds didn't realize how great his music was until he heard a bunch of college students singing it.
And to give the music a "field recording" feel, he kept the process simple: Each performance was recorded using six wide-range microphones, and most of the groups got it down in one or two takes.
"It was really difficult because we were doing my tracks from the bottom up," he says.
Ben Folds spoke to CNN about his youthful-sounding new release, why being married four times isn't much of a drama and why he faked an album leak.
I mean these guys, they'd just do a live take and they just don't know that the pros don't do it that way.
Folds: We kept them in what I would say is their natural habitat.
When you start messing with it and putting everyone on separate tracks you've lost the event and you've gained some sense of maybe perfection, but when it comes to the human voice, even-tempered piano tuning sounds incorrect to me.
I remember when everybody was talking about the possibility of downloading, and I was already having kids walk up with CDs they had burned for me to sign.
And it also has to do with people's general take on music and how it's framed.
So we wrote and recorded six songs in a day, mixed that day while we played our gig that night.
I think things were kind of cool.
... Everyone's life is different and I think the pace at which I've lived and the way that I tend to take a risk all contributes to the way that I write.
Folds: I have to work more quickly and more efficiently.
I wouldn't know about that with my (jokingly flexes muscles) -- it doesn't really occur to me, those things.
