Rye, New York (CNN) -- What was meant to be a celebration marking the end of Ramadan turned into a melee at an amusement park on Tuesday when a group of Muslim women were told they weren't allowed on certain rides with their headscarves.
Police shut down the park for several hours during the incident.
"Maybe there was a level of frustration that went around across the board," Ramadan said.
"Then you have the parks people who are trying to explain this and do their job."
He said park officials told the Muslim organizers about the headgear ban but that information wasn't relayed to the group of visitors.
"We repeatedly told him, because we knew this group would have religious headgear," Tartaglia insisted adding that a refund booth was set up in case anyone objected to the policy, which he said is posted prominently in the park.
"Hats must be secured, and jackets/sweaters must be worn properly and not around the waist while on a ride.
