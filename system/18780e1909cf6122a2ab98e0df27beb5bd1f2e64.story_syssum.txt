WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Obama unveiled his administration's blueprint for a new national network of high-speed passenger rail lines Thursday, saying such an investment is necessary to reduce traffic congestion, cut dependence on foreign oil and improve the environment.
We must start developing clean, energy-efficient transportation that will define our regions for centuries to come," Obama said at an event near the White House.
Obama has also proposed a separate five-year, $5 billion investment in high-speed rail as part of the administration's suggested fiscal year 2010 budget.
During the 2008 presidential campaign, Obama pledged to support a national network of faster passenger trains.
