Dunn, 47, who is white, was convicted of first-degree murder this month for shooting into an SUV full of African-American teenagers at a Jacksonville, Florida, gas station after an argument over loud music from the teens' vehicle.
Zimmerman, who maintained that he acted in self-defense, was acquitted last year by a Florida jury.
"We may have in this state 'stand your ground' laws but that doesn't allow you as a citizen, when you have a chance to diffuse a situation, for you to be so aggressive," he told CNN by phone on Friday.
"I want the Davis family to know I truly regret what happened," he said.
Davis' parents, Davis and Lucia McBath, made emotional statements at the hearing, which was attended by some of the jurors who convicted Dunn.
For me, there will be no future generation."
"My life as I had known it was shattered on November 23, 2012," he told the court.
After the longest hour of my life, the hospital confirmed that Jordan Russell Davis was deceased in the emergency room.
There wasn't a tear in his eyes, no tremble in his voice.
Dunn has said he shot at the vehicle because he thought Davis had a weapon and feared for his life, but the prosecution said Dunn was the aggressor and pointed out that he kept firing even after the teens fled.
Dunn was convicted in February on one count of shooting into a vehicle and three counts of attempted second-degree murder -- one each for Davis' friends, Leland Brunson, Tommie Stornes and Tevin Thompson, who were in the Dodge Durango with Davis.
