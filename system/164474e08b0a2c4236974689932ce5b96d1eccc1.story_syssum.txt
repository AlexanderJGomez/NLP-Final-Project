(CNN) -- Golf's governing bodies have ruled that the use of controversial anchored putters will be banned from 2016, following several months of consultation that drew strong U.S. opposition to the planned change.
"The essence of the traditional method of golf stroke involves the player swinging the club with both the club and the gripping hands being held away from the body.
1 Tiger Woods had also backed the ban, with the 14-time major winner calling for the ruling to be implemented "as soon as possible."
That will mean nine automatic places are on offer through qualifying results, as opposed to the 10 under his predecessor Jose Maria Olazabal last year.
U.S. captain Tom Watson reduced his wildcard selections from four to three earlier this year.
