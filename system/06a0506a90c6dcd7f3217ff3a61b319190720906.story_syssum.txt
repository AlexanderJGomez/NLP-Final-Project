Airing Sunday nights, the zombie apocalypse show picked up 20.2 million viewers for its Season Four premiere, a number that breaks records for nonsports telecasts on cable.
Nicotero, who still runs KNB, has now become involved in the theme park business by acting as a consultant for Universal Studios Orlando's "Walking Dead" attraction at their Halloween Horror Nights event.
Greg Nicotero: I appreciate you saying that because every season when I watch the show, I'm constantly looking at what I feel people responded to and what people like, and what I thought was successful or could be refined.
That's a really neat idea because, for background stuff, you don't need to worry about putting teeth into all of them.
The fact that viewers have responded very positively is rewarding because we fought very hard to make sure the show continues every season to raise the bar.
I don't know if "pressure" is the right word, but we feel an obligation to continue to make the show great.
Nicotero: I'm not there on a day-to-day basis, but I have interacted and consulted with Mike Aiello and his creative team in regards to all of the sculptures.
In a few instances, like with Michonne's pets, I sent them actual prosthetic pieces used on the show so their sculptors could duplicate, as close as possible, the work we did on the show.
They're going to connect themselves to the experience, and they now know what it's like to be on the set of "The Walking Dead."
Nicotero: That's a great question, and I'm very glad you asked that.
Before 1968 (when "Night of the Living Dead" came out), zombies were strictly referred to as a voodoo character, not even an undead but under a spell.
When I get to direct episodes now, what's fun is I throw little tributes in there.
The thing I love the most is I've been doing this 30 years, and every day I come to work and still learn more.
It really is the ultimate position, creatively, for me.
