And if you're looking for a way to welcome the season of flowers, the National Cherry Blossom Festival is a good place to start.
Also on April 13, Sakura Matsuri, a Japanese street festival, runs nearly a mile through downtown Washington and features traditional and Japanese pop musical performances, an arts and culture section, martial arts demonstrations and Japanese products, plus more than two dozen food vendors and two Kirin Ichiban beer gardens.
Enjoy a lunch cruise for $57 or a dinner cruise for $107 with Spirit Cruises, or just go for a 45-minute sightseeing cruise on the Capital Elite yacht for $26.
The Blossom Kite Festival, from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. March 30 on the Washington Monument grounds, showcases kite ballets and demonstrations by pros, but it also gives kids and families a chance to build and fly their own kites.
Plus, guests can sip complimentary sake at the evening wine hour from 5 to 6 p.m.
The Willard's Very Cherry Blossom Package for two is available through April 14, and includes valet parking, breakfast for two and two Old Town Trolley tour tickets.
