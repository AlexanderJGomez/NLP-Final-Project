On Sunday, the Yankees will play their last game before the stadium is torn down.
The Yankees had scheduled an afternoon workout, but I was so excited that I couldn't sleep and I drove in from my parents' house in New Jersey at 7 in the morning.
After introducing myself to a skeptical guard, he led me down two flights of stairs and through a hallway, where I was greeted by the clubhouse man Pete Sheehy (who died in 1985 and for whom the room is now named).
I asked Pete if this was the same room that Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig and all those guys used.
He pointed to a locker across the room where he used to bring "a bi-carb and coffee" each day to the Babe.
Looking up at the three tiers of stands was like being in the Roman Coliseum.
My big chance came on May 7, 1962, in the second game of a double-header against the Washington Senators, in front of a real crowd that included my Mom and Dad, my brothers and a whole bunch of neighbors from New Jersey.
My next pitch was a little bit high and manager Ralph Houk stepped out of the dugout - either to calm me down or remove me from the premises.
After the game Houk said to me, "any more shutouts like that and we're going to need a new bullpen."
That's the year I kept a diary that became Ball Four -- a book that also mentioned Mantle hitting a home run with a hangover -- which got me banned from Old Timers Day at Yankee Stadium for 28 years.
My eventual return to Yankee Stadium came after my son Michael wrote a letter to the New York Times, saying the Yankees should let bygones be bygones and invite me back.
Everything was painted blue and white -- the Yankee colors, get it?
If you check the current standings, you'll see this may already be happening.
