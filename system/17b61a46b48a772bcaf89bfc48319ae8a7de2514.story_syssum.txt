The calendar says May 1, but it might as well be winter across the front range of the Rockies where 5 inches or more of snow will be the norm from Cheyenne south to Denver.
Even with the late snow, the Colorado Department of Transportation will be out in force, with some 60 to 80 plows clearing roadways.
The average date for the last snow of the season in Denver is April 26, but the record for the latest snowfall ever was set June 12, 1947, according to the National Weather Service.
The 90-degree temperatures will last another day across New Mexico and western Texas, with daytime highs plummeting to the 50s on Thursday.
