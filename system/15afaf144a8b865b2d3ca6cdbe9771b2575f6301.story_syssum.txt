(CNN) -- South Korean president Lee Myung-bak apologized to his country for what he called "shameful incidents" involving his family and inner circle on Tuesday.
His brother, Lee Sang-deuk is a former six-term lawmaker and has widely been considered the major force behind Lee's presidential election in 2007.
In his address to the nation, Lee said he felt pain and regret over the scandals.
Lee's brother is not the first relative of a South Korean president to face criminal charges.
Former President Kim Dae-jung's three sons were also imprisoned for corruption by the end of his presidential term.
