The decision Tuesday is a blow for several states, the Obama administration and environmental groups, which had sought to prevent "upwind states" from emitting possibly unhealthy levels of contaminants across state borders, a requirement known as the "good neighbor" policy.
Kavanaugh described a "Catch-22" scenario that would make it hard for states to comply with federal rules.
Less stringent rules set up by the Bush administration will now go into place until the rules are rewritten.
"The result is an unsettling of the consistent precedent of this court strictly enforcing jurisdictional limits, a redesign of Congress's vision of cooperative federalism between the states and the federal government in implementing the CAA based on the court's own notions of absurdity and logic that are unsupported by a factual record, and a trampling on this court's precedent on which the (EPA) was entitled to rely in developing the Transport Rule rather than be blindsided by arguments raised for the first time in this court," wrote Rogers, a Clinton appointee to the appeals court.
"This rule would have prevented thousands of premature deaths and saved tens of billions of dollars a year in health costs, but two judges blocked that from happening and forced EPA to further delay long overdue health safeguards for Americans."
That move was praised by environmentalists but criticized by others, who predict lost jobs and a strain on the nation's power grid.
