Obama focused on the three priorities of the budget he will present to Congress later this week: energy, health care and education.
The president touted the $787 billion stimulus plan he signed into law last week, saying it will invest in areas critical to the country's economic recovery.
Obama predicted that because of the recovery plan, the United States will double its supply of renewable energy in the next three years.
Obama also said his budget will pay for more soldiers and Marines, increase their pay and expand veterans health care and benefits.
"A surplus became an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in our future," Obama said.
And all the while, critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time on some other day."
"We are now carefully reviewing our policies in both wars, and I will soon announce a way forward in Iraq that leaves Iraq to its people and responsibly ends this war," he said.
Because Obama's presidency is just a month old, the speech is not technically considered a State of the Union address.
