"She's pretty cut up," said a performer who saw the violence at the "Gathering of the Juggalos" in rural Hardin County, Illinois.
Tequila eventually escaped, but only after windows in her SUV were smashed, he said.
"I went onstage and immediately, before I even got on stage, dudes were throwing huge stone rocks in my face, beer bottles that slit my eye open, almost burnt my hair ... cuz they threw fire crackers on stage," she wrote.
The rocks and bottles flew harder and faster when Tequila bared her breasts, he said.
This was not  the only violent incident at the festival early Saturday, Seiner said.
A 49-year-old Georgia man was arrested for allegedly stabbing another man in the abdomen just hours earlier, he said.
