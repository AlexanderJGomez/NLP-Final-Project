But despite his menagerie of ceremonial credits, the consummate entertainer admits that it's the Tony Awards -- which Harris is hosting for the third time on Sunday, June 10, on CBS -- that hold the dearest spot in his heart.
Most everyone is a) thrilled to be there, b) even more thrilled to be nominated but c) and I think most importantly, they all know and are supportive of each other, so you end up with this great evening where it's not a lot of sour grapes."
"The more content I end up doing, then the less time everyone gets to spend watching performances, and really, in addition to doling out awards, that's the reason you watch," says Harris, who last year sang a duet with Hugh Jackman, a group performance with the New York Philharmonic cast of "Company" and a full opening and closing number.
As we count down the days until we can see what NPH has up his sleeve at the Tony Awards, we'll just have to make do with his opening number from last year.
