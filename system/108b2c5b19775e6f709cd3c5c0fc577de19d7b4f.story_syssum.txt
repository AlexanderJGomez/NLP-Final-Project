And like many times before, there is not much Washington or anyone else can do about it.
At the end of February, North Korea made an agreement with Washington to stop all missile tests and uranium enrichment in exchange for the United States to deliver 240,000 tons of food.
It is claiming that launching a satellite into space is not a military test, so it does not violate the international agreement; rather, the event was meant to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of its founder and "Eternal President," Kim Il Sung.
The U.S. says it will not deliver the food aid agreed to in February, but that further punishes a population living in misery.
Since North Korea tested its first nuclear weapon in 2006, the country has become more of a threat to the region and the world.
South Korea, a strong ally of the United States, responded with a trade embargo.
North Korea's nuclear and missile tests have also put Japan on edge more than once.
In 2008, videos of North Korean workers inside a mysterious plant in Syria added to suspicions and helped convince Israel that Syria was building a nuclear reactor to produce weapons-grade plutonium.
For the rest of the world, it should serve as a reminder of how dangerous it would be to allow more nuclear weapons anywhere, but especially in the Middle East, the most unstable region on earth.
