The children -- brothers -- were playing when the vehicle drove by carrying the four police officials, who had attended a funeral in eastern Falluja and were returning home when it detonated, police said.
The report of the blast came after bombings in three Iraqi cities over the previous day killed five people and wounded several others, police told CNN.
On Tuesday night, three people were killed in Baghdad when a car bomb exploded on a commercial street in the southwestern Saydiya neighborhood.
This came after a bloody Sunday, when 17 bombs exploded across Baghdad, killing at least 19 people and wounding more than 80, Iraqi authorities said.
Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said he plans to meet this month with Iraqi political leaders to discuss whether to ask that U.S. troops remain in Iraq beyond the January 1, 2012, withdrawal deadline.
