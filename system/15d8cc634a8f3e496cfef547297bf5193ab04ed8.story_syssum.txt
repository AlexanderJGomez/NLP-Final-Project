Leung, the Hong Kong leader whose resignation has become a rallying cry for the protesters that have filled the city's streets this week, was a relative unknown before he took the top job in 2012.
"He wanted to present himself as someone from the grassroots, not linked to the tycoons... but people have been terribly disappointed," says Joseph Cheng, a professor of political science at City University of Hong Kong.
"He is in daily communication with Beijing," says Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
The moniker sounds similar in Cantonese to his family name but also suggests a cunning political operator.
"C.Y., despite his pantomime villain appearance, hasn't really turned out to be all that cartoonable," he told CNN.
Leung has only appeared in public three times; twice for press conferences and once for a National Day flag-raising ceremony attended by dignitaries.
"Beijing would ... lose face if they were to sack Leung in the near future," says Lam at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
