Holt faces state charges of first degree murder, kidnapping, extortion, and intent to inflict death or serious bodily harm, the spokesman said.
The FBI won't reveal the suspected motive or why agents believe it was Holt who left a uniquely signed ransom note demanding money two days after Wiles disappeared.
Holt is described as an employee who, at least at one time, had a supervisory role at the company.
Without disclosing details, agents said the investigation led them back to Holt and his whereabouts the day Wiles disappeared.
They are said to be in seclusion after being notified about Holt's arrest.
And they can just go and live their life, and we just want him back."
