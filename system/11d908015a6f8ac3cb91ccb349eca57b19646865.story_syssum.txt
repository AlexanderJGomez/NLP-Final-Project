New York (CNN) -- Jorge Munoz is a bus driver in New York City who started feeding the hungry in Queens five years ago, using food that would otherwise have been thrown away.
But then I realized it was like a mission from God for my family.
But it was good food and I asked them about it, if they could give it to me because I knew someone would want it.
So in Jackson Heights I saw people waiting on the corner, and I asked them what they were doing and they said they had no money for food.
And the first week it was eight guys, and the next week 24 and so on.
For the last few months, every piece of bread I get I bring in the morning with soda or water that I buy.
And this time of the year, on the website, I ask for coat donations.
If you hand a meal to someone who hasn't eaten anything in the last 20 hours and they smile, you know you did something good.
One example, there was a teacher in Afghanistan and she e-mailed me saying she wanted to start a small meal program in their town because of my story.
And there was a little girl in Texas, I think she's 8, after CNN Heroes, she saw the show and the next weekend she went out with her friends and family and sold brownies and lemonade and made $25 and sent it to me with a note saying she was touched by my efforts.
Today President Barack Obama wants to shake your hand and tell you not to give up your mission.
Munoz: If you share, share anything you have you're not using like clothes, toys, share it to make other people happy.
People in this country cook more than they need and two days later it goes from the refrigerator to the garbage.
And imagine if everyone around the world got together to change the lives of the hungry.
So share, it's a beautiful thing.
