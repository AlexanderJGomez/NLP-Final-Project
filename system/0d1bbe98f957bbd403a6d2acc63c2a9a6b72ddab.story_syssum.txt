LONDON, England (CNN) -- Blake Mycoskie is the founder and "chief shoe giver" of TOMS Shoes, a company that matches every pair of shoes it sells with a free pair to an impoverished child.
Mycoskie: I decided to go back to some of the places that my sister and I had visited on "The Amazing Race."
I started thinking, what if I started a business where every time I sold a pair of shoes, I would guarantee that customer that I would give another pair to someone who does not have shoes?
There were a lot of really cool styles of shoes in Argentina that we did not have in the United States so I picked one of them, the alpargata, and I started figuring out how to make shoes.
This could be a real business and it could be a real player in the fashion industry and it could really set a tone for how fashion companies could give back.
Mycoskie: A big part of our business that has changed over the past year is that now we also have a travel organization that takes volunteers all over the world on these trips and [they] get the experience of giving away the shoes.
One of the things we have always done with all of our factories is I personally visit them and we actually show our documentary film about what we do.
I mean I have no desire to start any other company for as long as I live because this is the perfect blend of business and philanthropy to me.
