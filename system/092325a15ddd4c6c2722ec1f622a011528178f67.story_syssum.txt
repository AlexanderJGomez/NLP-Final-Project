But Butler's daughter is one of thousands on waiting lists for the 49,000 Head Start classrooms around the country - a list that might get shorter after an investigation into allegations of fraud by some applicants and Head Start workers.
The investigation began two years ago, after whistleblowers called the GAO's tip line and alleged that Head Start workers in the Midwest and Texas admitted families that made too much money to qualify.
In some cases, according to the GAO, workers may have lied or manipulated documents so their programs appeared to be within mandated enrollment targets.
To investigate the complaints, Kutz sent staff members armed with hidden cameras to pose as parents interested in Head Start enrollment.
The investigators' documents showed they made too much money to enroll, but at eight of the 15 Head Start centers they approached, staff members pretended they hadn't seen the income levels, or they urged parents to lie.
The problem, Kutz said, is that Head Start workers only have to sign a statement that they've seen proof of parents' incomes.
"In always maintaining copies of proof of income in our files, that's enabled us to ensure that the families that deserve to be in the program are the ones who are getting into the program."
"We know that what went on the tape, [that the worker] engaged in some fraudulent behavior," she said.
A new Health and Human Services tip line lets workers report fraud to the department, which oversees Head Start, instead of going straight to the GAO.
"The time we spend together has meant the world to me, but the things I've taught her are only things I know," Butler said.
