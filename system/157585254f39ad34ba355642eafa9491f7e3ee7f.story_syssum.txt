They got the gas cans, and Anthony put the gas in her car herself, he testified.
"I'm probably the one who put that on" the gas can, George Anthony said, adding that at the time, after Caylee was reported missing, he and his wife were "running on fumes.
He said that when his daughter returned the gas cans to him, there was no tape on them.
In addition to capital murder in Caylee's death, Casey Anthony, now 25, faces six other charges, including aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter of a child and providing false information to authorities.
George Anthony testified Tuesday and was re-called to the stand Thursday for part of the morning session.
He said that after June 10, he never saw Caylee again, but he saw Anthony on July 1 and again on July 15, when she picked him up at the airport after he had vacationed in Puerto Rico.
Morales was one of numerous people, including Lazzaro, his roommates and other acquaintances, who said Anthony did not mention Caylee's disappearance between June 16, 2008, the day the little girl was last seen, until the evening of July 15, when Anthony's mother, Cindy, reported her missing to authorities.
Asked by Baez whether he found it shocking that he wouldn't notice a change in her behavior after the little girl disappeared, Salati said yes.
Two women who worked as "shot girls" selling alcoholic shots to club patrons there testified Wednesday that Anthony was a sort of overseer, telling them where to be and making sure they weren't harmed.
One friend of Anthony's, Matthew Crisp, testified that he met her for lunch on July 7 and asked about Caylee.
Baez, in his opening statement Tuesday, dropped bombshell allegations, telling jurors that Caylee was not murdered at all, but drowned in the Anthonys' pool on June 16.
In his earlier testimony, George Anthony denied ever sexually abusing his daughter or that he found Caylee dead in his pool.
