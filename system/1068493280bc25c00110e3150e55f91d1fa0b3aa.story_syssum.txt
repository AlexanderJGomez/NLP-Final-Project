Washington (CNN) -- An envelope that tested positive for the deadly poison ricin was intercepted Tuesday afternoon at the U.S. Capitol's off-site mail facility in Washington, congressional and law enforcement sources tell CNN.
Sen. Claire McCaskill told reporters after a briefing for lawmakers that a suspect has already been identified in the incident, but a knowledgeable source said no one was in custody Tuesday night.
A previous ricin scare hit the Capitol in 2004, when tests identified a letter in a Senate mailroom that served then-Majority Leader Bill Frist's office.
The discovery forced 16 employees to go through decontamination procedures, but no one reported any ill effects afterward, Frist said.
But experts say it is more effective on individuals than as a weapon of mass destruction.
He was then elected to the seat in 2008 and won re-election in 2012 to a second term.
