(CNN) -- Opening statements are set to begin Tuesday in the trial of self-help author and speaker James Arthur Ray, who is charged with three counts of reckless manslaughter in the death of three people at an Arizona sweat lodge.
Prosecutors claim Ray, 53, was reckless and that the lodge -- made of willow trees and branches, and covered with tarpaulins and blankets -- was heated to a perilously high temperature, causing the participants to suffer dehydration and heat stroke.
Ray also encouraged participants to hydrate throughout the retreat and warned them the sweat lodge would be very hot, his attorney has said.
While they were not prevented from leaving, participants have said they were encouraged to wait until the breaks between rounds.
The sweat lodge, 5 feet tall and 23 feet wide, was built to accommodate up to 75 people.
Li wrote in the 2009 letter that Ray "did not lead or pressure participants into making a choice they otherwise would not have made.
