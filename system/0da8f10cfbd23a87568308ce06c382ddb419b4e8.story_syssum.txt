A one hectare research initiative known as the Sahara Forest Project -- modest in size, but not in ambition -- has produced a harvest of barley, cucumbers and arugula in the last few months using a mix of ingredients not usually associated with successful agriculture: seawater and Qatar's ample supply of heat.
"Qatar is one of the most challenging climates in the world to work in for this kind of thing," says Dr. Virginia Corless, the science and development manager.
The facility features a concentrated solar power plant, which turns heat into steam, then, with turbines and generators, into electricity, which in turn pumps seawater to the site, where it is used to cool the greenhouses.
Lastly, the saltwater is also used to cultivate algae, which can be used for large-scale bio-energy production -- though currently the algae plant is still in the research phase.
"The biggest issues right now are climate change and water resources globally, and these simple technologies can tackle both," he says.
"With the same funding, you could restore ecosystems and help people more effectively through community-based natural resource management," says Patrick Gonzalez, a forest ecologist who has conducted research in the Sahel region of North Africa with the University of California, Berkeley.
"It helps when people can see it on the ground, and taste the cucumbers and see that this is real," he says.
