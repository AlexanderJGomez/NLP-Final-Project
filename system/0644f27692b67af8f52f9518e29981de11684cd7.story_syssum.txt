at the Bollywood Movie Awards in Long Island about filmmaking in India and America and her adaptation of Jhumpa Lahiri's novel about loss and family, "The Namesake."
It was at that state of mourning that I picked up this novel, and in it Jhumpa writes really acutely of a loss of a parent in a foreign country, and I thought I had been understood by someone.
It's a tale of millions of us that have left one home for another, and tried to find out who we are through these places.
It is also equally a love story between two people who come from a culture who don't send roses and diamonds for love; who sit at a kitchen table and look at each other.
He came to my office and auditioned and he was just so appealing, and so much the real thing, that I cast him as Gogol.
we really made for the children on the streets and the kids who really love that Bollywood stuff, and also with "Deeply Alternative," which ran for 27 weeks.
Nair: In India it is more about orchestrating chaos, and it's about sifting the chaos, but I get especially excited about the throb and chaos on the streets and so on, and in America it's about paying for the chaos, you know every head has to be placed there and paid for.
I live actively in three continents and I've done that for most of my life, so I just make films as I see the world, and that happens to speak to people.
That's what I hope to do when I make a film -- to get under your skin and really make you think about something, and have a transporting time that takes you somewhere.
