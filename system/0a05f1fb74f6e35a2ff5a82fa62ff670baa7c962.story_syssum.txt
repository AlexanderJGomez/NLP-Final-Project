London (CNN) -- Police in London were on Friday questioning a suspected rogue trader arrested after Swiss banking giant UBS discovered an estimated $2 billion worth of unauthorised deals.
Brokers tell CNN the unauthorized trade in question at UBS was likely on an exchange traded fund (ETF) -- a structured instrument based on one or more underlying assets -- that is sold as a fund but trades like a stock.
Its review of UBS will focus on "ongoing weaknesses in the group's risk management and controls" as revealed by the reported loss, Moody's said in a statement.

Lex van Dam, a former trader who is now a partner at Hampstead Capital in London, said chaos in the markets could have put more pressure on a trader desperate to hang onto his job.
UBS said no client positions were affected by the loss, which is still being investigated.
The loss would potentially be among the largest costs ever to a bank in unauthorized trading.
There is a "much higher chance that this bank will now be broken up" into a wealth managament firm and an investment bank to reduce clients' exposure to investment banking losses, he said.
UBS made a pre-tax profit of about $1.9 billion in the second quarter of this year, it announced in July, down from about $2.5 billion the quarter before that.
