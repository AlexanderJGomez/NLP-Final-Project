During a news conference, 68-year-old Barry Clifford said that the remains of the possible ship off the coast of Haiti probably hold "a great deal of cultural material" but that he and his team of divers can tell that thieves have disrupted the wreck and taken things.
A CNN team was in Haiti on Wednesday and asked the senior adviser to the country's prime minister about Clifford's claims.
His assertion that he's probably found the Santa Maria is tied to a shipwreck he and his team investigated in 2003.
But some items, including the cannon, had been looted from the ship in the intervening years, Clifford said.
The ship was found in the exact area where Columbus said the Santa Maria ran aground more than 500 years ago, Clifford said.
The voyage aimed to find a westward route to China, India and the gold and spice islands of the East.
Some planks and provisions from the wrecked ship, which was about 117 feet (36 meters) long, were used by the garrison at the fort, according to Encyclopaedia Britannica.
