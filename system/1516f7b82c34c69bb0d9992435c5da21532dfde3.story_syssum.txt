"I don't know why, but a lot of the time I don't realize that I'm doing it.
And in the music video for her peppy song "Dance Anthem of The '80s" she gets her face so close to the camera that at times you think she's going to gobble it up.
She talked about the floppiness of the '80s and what it's like to be a songwriter who never writes anything down.
The following is an edited version of the interview.
It's like the teleprompter inside my head just goes off and I can't remember anything.
Spektor: Yeah, I think because I spent all the '80s in the Soviet Union, my '80s were the '90s...even the beginning of 2000 actually.
Even though artistically it was really a fun decade, I think economically it was a very dangerous decade.
It was a time of big, fast spenders and people who just didn't really think about the consequences of their greed.
I don't know why everybody wants things to be cohesive in the first place.
I just sort of play it over and over again until it's cemented in my head.
Spektor: Yeah and some of the bad ones stick, and some of the good ones get forgotten.
I've actually gotten better because I used to just have to hold the songs in my head until the next time I would record them.
I think it's really cool that musicians get to make music videos because it's our chance to learn about cameras and cinematography and this whole other world that goes on.
We kind of incubate and make a lot of art together, share ideas.
How did that happen?
