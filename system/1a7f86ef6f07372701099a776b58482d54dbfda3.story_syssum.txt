At the same time, he noted the police officer still has not been formally charged, much less convicted and sentenced.
According to a medical report, Nowarah was pronounced dead in a hospital less than two hours later, having suffered a single bullet wound that entered his chest and passed out his back.
However, Khadder's camera shows that less than 15 seconds after one of these gunshots, Palestinians were already racing to put the fatally wounded Nowarah in the ambulance.
It was not immediately clear what connection, if any, this soldier had to the arrested border police officer.
And experts were able to "calculate the firing angle from which the shot was taken" based on where the bullets entered and left the teenager's body, according to the human rights advocate.
