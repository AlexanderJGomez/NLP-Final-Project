Roland Martin says there's an assumption the word "qualified" needs to be used for women, minorities.
Give me the most unqualified person to sit on the highest court in the land!
Why do we as a society feel the need to say it's important to have "qualified" women or minorities?
Part of the issue is that a lot of folks have bought into the notion that any minority has gotten a job based on their skin color or a woman is hired because of her gender, so therefore, we better emphasize the need for a "qualified" person.
Then I would look at some of the most incompetent white men and women who worked for her and ask myself, "I wonder if they passed the qualified test?"
In the 17 years I've been a professional journalist, I've seen unqualified white men, white women and, yes, minorities hired and promoted, and affirmative action had nothing to do with it.
It's simply time that when it comes to women or minorities, we should retire the use of word "qualified."
