A high-level Venezuelan military source with knowledge of the situation told CNN en Español the mayor was taken into custody because of his alleged involvement in a plot to overthrow the government an accusation Maduro leveled last week.
The mayor's office told CNN en Español that more than 150 intelligence agents participated in Thursday's raid.
Richard Blanco, an opposition Venezuelan lawmaker whose office is also in the building, said he witnessed Ledezma's arrest.
Word of his detention spread rapidly on social media after a Twitter post from the mayor's account Thursday evening said his office had been surrounded by police.
In his national broadcast Thursday night, Maduro repeated accusations that his government had blocked a U.S.-backed opposition coup plot that included plans to attack the presidential palace with a military jet.
The accusations and the Caracas mayor's arrest come as opposition protesters mark the one-year anniversary of a wave of anti-government demonstrations that rocked Venezuela and led to the arrest of opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez.
