The murders have received a lot of international attention because the bodies were found with handwritten messages claiming that the couple had been killed for snitching on the cartels via the Internet.
It is not clear whether the couple was killed for actually posting something online or whether their murder was used as an opportunity to scare people away from social media.
Social media open new opportunities for empowering the disenfranchised, but they also create big new challenges -- some so big that people's lives might hang in the balance.
The American media are in a privileged position to report safely on what is happening in Mexico.
My hope is that the fascination for social media communication will drive better coverage of systemic issues at the core of the conflict, such as debates on decriminalization, arms and human trafficking.
