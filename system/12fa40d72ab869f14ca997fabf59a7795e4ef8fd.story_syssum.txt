Oak Creek, Wisconsin (CNN) -- Members of the Sikh temple where six people died in a weekend rampage swept, scrubbed and painted over damage to their building Thursday after investigators allowed them back inside.
But standing with the relatives of other victims, Amardeep Kaleka, the son of the congregation's slain leader, called the killings an act of cowardice.
In addition to the six dead, three people -- two temple members and a police officer who responded to Sunday's attack -- remained hospitalized Thursday.
"There is evidence he also may have subsequently suffered a stroke," the hospital said in a statement, adding that he was on a ventilator in critical condition.
The incident occurred slightly more than two weeks after a shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, left 12 people dead and 58 wounded.
Those numbers are identical to where they were in 2011, and the number who support major restrictions or a complete ban has remained in the 48%-to-50% range for more than a decade.
