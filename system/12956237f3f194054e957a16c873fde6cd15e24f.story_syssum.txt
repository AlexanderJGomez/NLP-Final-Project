The judge ruled that even though the 5-year-old child was injured in a swimming pool accident this week, it was not an emergency or crisis situation requiring that Usher's two children be taken from him.
And Ms. Oden did impress me as a capable caregiver," Fulton County Superior Court Judge John Goger said, referring to the boy's aunt, Rena Oden, who was caring for the child at the time of the accident.
Foster Raymond also said Usher does not keep her informed about who is taking of their children or the doings in the children's lives.
In reference to their other son jumping into the pool to help Usher V, Foster Raymond testified: "He can't even swim, he was trying to save his brother.
He said he tells Foster Raymond about doctors' visits, summer camps, or travel, including the aliases used to book hotel rooms, in the rare event he travels with the kids.
The aunt also said she knows CPR, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, though she needs to be recertified.
Usher, won primary custody of the couple's two children, Usher V and 4-year-old Naviyd, last year after a bitter court fight in which Foster Raymond accused the singer of being an absentee father.
That case hadn't been heard by the time the swimming pool accident happened Monday, so Foster Raymond filed Tuesday for an emergency hearing on the matter.
