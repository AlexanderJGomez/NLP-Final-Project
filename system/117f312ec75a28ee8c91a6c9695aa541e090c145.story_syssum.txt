Anderson,  whose real name is Christina Walsh, appeared with her attorney  on  ABC's "Good Morning America" Monday to speak out about an alleged  violent  encounter she had with Sheen at the hotel.
Davidson defended his client's  right to receive compensation "for the damage to her body, to her  emotional state, and to her purse," but wouldn't go into details about  whether there had been any talk of a financial settlement.
She also  accused Sheen of "snorting a white, powdery substance."
Sheen spent several hours in a New York hospital in October after police responded to an early morning call about "an emotionally disturbed person" at The Plaza Hotel, a law enforcement source said.
