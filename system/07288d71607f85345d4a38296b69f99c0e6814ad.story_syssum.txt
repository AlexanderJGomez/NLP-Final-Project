That's 14% above the original's opening gross of $43.7 million from 2010.
The re-imagined fairy tale, which didn't score too high with critics but resonated with moviegoers, now has a three-week cume of $163.5 million.
It earned an estimated $15.7 million for a 10-day total of $81.7 million.
That said, the real test will come next weekend when distributor A24 expands the film nationwide.
How to Train Your Dragon 2 â€” $50 million
Despite this being only the fourth time the box office has had two films grossing more than $50 million in their debuts, the overall yield was down 7% compared to the same weekend last year, when Man of Steel had a $116.6M debut and This is the End bowed to $20.7M.
