Joe Dinardo, left, and Clark Dever will be spending only 12 hours in each city before going to their next stop.
Dever, who was recently saving up money to be a professional photographer, quit his job, and Dinardo decided to use all of his accumulated vacation time from his job to take the trip.
They plan to interview fellow fliers to get the skinny on the best places to go in hopes of taking the "local's tour" of a city as opposed to a generic tourist trip for their Web site twelvehoursinacity.com.
JetBlue suspended the deal two days early, saying they were sold out, though the company declined to specify how many people bought them.
Given JetBlue's hub structure, many travelers found a slight hiccup: If they were in the Midwest, they might have to travel all the way back to New York to travel to the West Coast.
The couple will be spending a large chunk of their trip in South America and the Caribbean and will be doing video interviews with entrepreneurs around the world for Will Dearman's Web site, TheStrategyBlog.com.
"No matter what happens, there will certainly be a story that comes out of this trip," Dever said.
