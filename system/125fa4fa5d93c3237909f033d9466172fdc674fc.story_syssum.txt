Neuroimaging results for the patients with Alzheimer's disease were as expected, according to the study, which was published online in the journal Radiology.
More than 50 percent of the brains in the MCI group showed atrophy similar to the Alzheimer's disease patients.
They found that patients who earlier had mild cognitive impairment plus signs of atrophy were getting worse.
The rest of the patients were stable and their symptoms had not increased," McEvoy said.
In addition, researchers hope that within the next few years patients could regularly be tested by their physicians to determine their risk of developing  Alzheimer's.
"If nothing else it would be good information for their family members to have early on, to be better prepared for the future."
