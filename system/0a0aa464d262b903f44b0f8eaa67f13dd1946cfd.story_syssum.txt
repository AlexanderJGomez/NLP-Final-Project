Across the country, math geeks in museums, schools, private groups and elsewhere gather to celebrate the number pi, approximately 3.14.
Even that many digits are more than most people would need for everyday use, but some folks have been inspired to memorize thousands of digits of pi, or even use the digits to create poetry or music.
In countries where the day is written before the month, Friday is 14-3, which looks less like pi.
"And so Pi Day is an acquired taste," mathematician Jonathan Borwein, at the University of Newcastle in Australia, said in an e-mail.
If you want to go where the day is said to be "invented," look no further than San Francisco's Exploratorium.
For those who can't attend in person, the Exploratorium has a Second Life Pi Day event that includes "irrational exhibits, fireworks, cheerleaders, music, and dancing."
The "brainiac town" residents "love this event because it's a way for them to celebrate how quirky they are," said Mimi Omiecinski, owner of the Princeton Tour Company, who started Princeton Pi Day in 2009.
"A lot of them get super into it."
Even the Salvador Dali Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, will celebrate the day, as "Dali loved the irrational numbers Pi and Phi, often using them and other mathematical principles in his art," according to the museum.
Blatner says that Pi Day has become a hit for the same reason the new "Cosmos" TV show is getting so much attention.
That's because pi to four digits after the decimal is 3.1415, and we're unlikely to survive until 2115 to see that second instance of pi perfection.
