The 27-year-old woman, who is 5 months' pregnant, was last seen around 8 p.m. local time Sunday at her sister's home in Haiku.
"We are asking anyone who is assisting in the search to call the (police) department if they find any suspicious items, however, please do not touch, move or recover the item as it may be evidence in this case or another case that the department is investigating," the police said.
The ex-boyfriend claimed that he'd assisted in searches for Scott, though her family had become "hostile" to him lately.
Frustrated."
