In recent interviews with about a half-dozen prominent evangelicals, no one listed opposition to gay marriage as their top priority.
"There is a recognition that while the fight should not be given up on upholding the several thousand-year-old definition of marriage, the courts are probably very quickly going to undo that," said Erick Erickson, a conservative pundit and editor of RedState.com.
Evangelicals are an influential bloc of the party and if the community eases its opposition to same-sex marriage, that could make it easier for candidates to do the same.
"There's not been enough standing up for marriage especially in the wake of what is essentially a constitutional crisis."
"If we don't recognize (the culture shift), we're clueless as to what is happening," Moore said in an interview.
He went to a conference sponsored by Moore's group in October and was surprised that even his staunchest critics constructively interacted with him.
The generational split is even more pronounced among the GOP: nearly two-thirds of Republicans under 30 favor same sex marriage compared to 39% of all Republicans, according to the Pew Research Center survey.
Hoover runs the American Unity PAC, which spent more than $4 million in the 2014 cycle to support pro-gay marriage and LGBT rights Republican candidates, according to the group's pre-election Federal Elections Commission filing.
