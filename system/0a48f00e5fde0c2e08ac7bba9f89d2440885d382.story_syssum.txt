After celebrity gossip site TMZ released footage of Baldwin shouting profanity at an aggressive videographer (with muffled audio that may or may not have contained a gay slur), Baldwin published a bitter "goodbye to public life" essay in New York Magazine.
Upon first reading of Baldwin's tirade, you might have missed the solution (after all, the piece is rather long and, at times, tiresome).
Why not take one with you when you go in public, thus ensuring the public can always see your side of the story?
Does that sound like too much trouble?
Go about your daily life, but have a trusted and well-paid photographer at your side, documenting just how rude, invasive, and aggressive the celebrity chasers can be.
As USA Today reported earlier this month, police departments are outfitting their officers with wearable cameras to protect both police and citizens against unfair accusations.
Baldwin said in his diatribe, "You're out there in a world where if you do make a mistake, it echoes in a digital canyon forever."
If you do, the celebrity gossip sites will win.
