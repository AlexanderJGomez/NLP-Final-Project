McCullough is a citizen scientist -- a do-goodery term for volunteers who help collect data about the natural world -- who uses the photo-sharing site Flickr to catalog photos of whales.
This can be used to tell one whale from another, much the way fingerprints work for humans.
Last year, for example, McCullough -- a spry, gray-haired woman who wears tinted glasses that nearly cover her face and an orange jacket bright enough to make onlookers wish they had tinted lenses of their own -- did a casual Flickr search and noticed that a particular humpback whale, No.
That migration route was longer than any that had been recorded for a single humpback, according to a journal article that cited the finding.
If you upload the photos to a public photo-sharing website -- Flickr is just one of many -- and tag them with a date and location, then scientists may be able to use that photo to track the whale on its journeys through the ocean.
Taking a photo of a whale can be the start of a lifelong learning experience, she said.
