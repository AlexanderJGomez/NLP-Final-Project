(CNN) -- Luis Suarez may have been the villain of Liverpool's 2011-12 season, but the Uruguay striker is doing his best to make amends in another difficult start to this English Premier League campaign.
While Liverpool couldn't capitalize on that advantage, Rodgers was grateful for another virtuoso show from Suarez -- who also scored in last weekend's Merseyside derby draw with Everton, when he had a late winner wrongly ruled out for offside.
It was, however, Liverpool's fifth draw this season and followed a humiliating 3-1 midweek League Cup defeat at home to Rodgers' former club Swansea -- when Suarez also scored.
In Italy's Serie A, Napoli failed to capitalize on Juventus' first defeat in 50 matches, being held 1-1 at home by Torino on Sunday despite a sixth-minute goal from Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani.
Werder Bremen beat Mainz 2-1 in Sunday's other Bundesliga fixture, with two goals from Aaron Hunt lifting his team to seventh place and above the visitors on goal difference.
Deportivo la Coruna joined Sociedad and Celta Vigo on 10 points from 10 games after beating Mallorca 1-0, while Athletic Bilbao moved above that group to 14th with a 2-1 win at Grenada thanks to two goals from Aritz Aduriz.
