(CNN) -- Octuplets mom Nadya Suleman pleaded not guilty Friday to welfare fraud charges relating to allegations that she did not report money that she earned as a topless dancer and adult film actress, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office.
"This is not a new career for her," her rep, Gina Rodriguez, told CNN in June when asked about her stripping gig.
Suleman, who collected food stamps to feed her 14 young children, filed for bankruptcy in May, but the case was tossed out of court because of paperwork issues.
Suleman faces up to five years, eight months in prison if convicted, the prosecutor said.
