A little more than a week ago, Osama's father, former President Mohamed Morsy, was forcibly ousted by the Egyptian military and swiftly replaced with a civilian transitional government.
The defense minister is essentially saying to the millions that voted in presidential elections and on the constitutional referendum, 'you don't know what is best for you.
For the millions of Egyptians who packed the streets in a nationwide revolt on June 30 and screamed "Leave!"
Because there is no revolution in the world that brings military rule.
With a 48-hour deadline imposed by the military looming, Mohamed Morsy spoke to his son for the last time before addressing the country on state television on July 2.
The green-eyed father of two had refused to speak in his broken English until the moment he was asked whether he tried to contact his father in custody.
The January 25 revolution of 2011 led to the ouster of longtime President Hosni Mubarak.
Hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood supporters remain in detention, and the public prosecutor has issued dozens of arrest warrants for top leadership, but the younger Morsy chose to meet in broad daylight at one of the most recognizable mosques in Cairo.
Over and over again, the 30-year-old judge repeated the well-being of his father is secondary to the principles of democracy and the demands of thousands of pro-Morsy supporters staging a sit-in just outside the window.
Despite his bold resilience, Osama longed to reach out to his missing father.
