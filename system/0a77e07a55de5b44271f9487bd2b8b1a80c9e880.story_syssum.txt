If she prevails in a potential challenge, Murkowski would become the second person to ever win a write-in bid for the U.S. Senate.
However, 8,153 of Murkowski's votes have been contested by the Miller campaign.
"You can see that the numbers just won't add up," Sweeney told CNN, referring to Miller's hopes of pulling out a win despite the rising tide against him.
He said he may request a recount, that he wants to ensure that some military ballots were mailed out, and that the difference between his votes and Murkowski's may shift if a "consistent standard" for evaluating the write-in ballots is applied.
Palin endorsed Miller over Murkowski for the state's GOP Senate primary, and the national Tea Party group followed suit.
Shortly after, Murkowski launched a write-in bid to retain her seat.
