Davies is one of the few characters on the show who has the ability to shake one of the central figures: the unshakeable agent Ari Gold.
CNN talked to Belfi, who's also in the movie "Surrogates" (opening Friday), about his experiences on the show and his inspiration for the role.
Belfi: Adam Davies has become ... one of the few characters on the show that really knows how to get under Ari's skin and push his buttons.
And I get that response from a lot of the fans of the show.
Belfi: I started way back on season one in the beginning of the show.
So a lot of the inspiration came from meetings I had when I was starting out -- you know, behavior I experienced from agents and other industry people when I was starting out.
... [But] we haven't gotten to see any of the personal life of Adam Davies.
So in that respect, it seems like he's someone you'd want on your side.
So you're either best friends or mortal enemies when you share that much in common with somebody.
And it was maybe more prominent in the first couple of seasons than it is now because it's evolved slightly.
CNN: Of course, our diehard "Entourage" fans would love to get some scoop on the coming story lines.
But in terms of the really exciting stuff between Adam Davies and Ari, I guess I'll say this: At the end of season two, when Ari is trying to form his coup, to break up the agency, and Adam is the one who rats him out and gets him fired and humiliated and causes that whole thing ...
In the amazing way that Doug has constructed it, all that stuff from the end of season two comes full circle.
