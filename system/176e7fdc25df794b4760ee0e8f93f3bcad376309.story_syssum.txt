If its projected performance figures prove to be true, this radical electric concept car -- the brainchild of an award-winning young Croatian designer -- could accelerate faster than all but two of the fastest supercars on earth.
Mate Rimac says that he has always been motivated by the desire to demonstrate the superiority of electric over petrol-powered cars: "I have two passions; cars and technology," Rimac says.
Not just city cars for boring stuff, but to show people that the future will be interesting -- that one day when petrol is gone and you only have electric cars in the world, you won't have to compromise in terms of performance, speed or (how) far (it can go)."
The car is still recognized in the Guinness Book of World Records for the fastest quarter mile by an electric vehicle.
Preliminary impressions from the automotive press have been generally positive, although many, such as GTspirit.com, said that they approached the concept of a vehicle that has "no sound, no downshift and no smell of burnt petrol" with trepidation.
When Rimac releases a production car into the wild in the not-too-distant future, the eyes of the world will certainly be watching.
