New York (CNN) -- A New York college student died of head injuries last week during a fraternity ritual held in Pennsylvania, the local coroner's office said Monday.
The objective was for Deng, who was blindfolded and wearing a backpack filled with a 20-pound bag of sand, to navigate toward someone who was calling for him "while other fraternity brothers physically prevent that from happening," witnesses said, according to the affidavit.
Physicians determined Deng had suffered major brain trauma, and he was put on life support, according to the district attorney's office.
Baruch College has a "zero tolerance policy regarding hazing," according to the statement.
