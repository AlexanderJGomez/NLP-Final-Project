(CNN) -- Negotiations aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions may have stalled in Switzerland this weekend, but the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency is optimistic about a new agreement struck with Tehran.
He said the deal would take a step by step approach to solving problems, bearing in mind the complications in dealing with the Iranian nuclear issue.
The IAEA chief has reason to be optimistic, given that this is his first agreement with Iran in years, said Joseph Cirincione, president of Ploughshares Fund, a public grant-making foundation focused on nuclear weapons policy and conflict resolution.
"This is for real, these guys are not playing a con game," Cirincione said.
On Tuesday, the U.S. State Department also sounded upbeat, saying significant progress was made in Geneva.
Iran's refusal to stop enriching uranium has led to crippling sanctions that have stunted its economy, slashed its crude oil exports and triggered widespread inflation at home.
The State Department said Kerry would make it clear that putting new sanctions in place would be a mistake.
It may take a few more weeks, but it is crystal clear, the majority of P5+1 believe a deal is in our best interest."
