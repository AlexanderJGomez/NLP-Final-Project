(CNN) -- Anti-China protesters gathered Saturday in Tokyo and six other major cities in Japan to rally against what it calls an invasion of disputed islands that both claim are part of their territories.
Beijing and Tokyo have been clashing over the arrest of a Chinese fishing captain by Japan off the disputed islands.
China should apologize and pay for the repair of the vessel because the captain was in Japan's territory when the accident happened, according to Fukumoto.
Beijing has sought an apology and compensation over the arrest, which Tokyo has rejected.
