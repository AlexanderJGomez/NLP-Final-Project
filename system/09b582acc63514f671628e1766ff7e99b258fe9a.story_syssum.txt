Woodward, an associate editor of The Washington Post, says in "The War Within: A Secret White House History 2006-2008" that the assassination program, not the 2007 increase in U.S. forces in the war zone known as "the surge," is primarily responsible for the reduction of violence in Iraq.
But by and large, to suggest that anything like this being done now has been the major reason for the decline in violence is a bit rich.
Then when America put 100,000-plus insurgents on the U.S. government payroll, including members of al Qaeda, that not only took them out of the field, but it also let them run their own assassination programs against the Iranian-backed militias.
But the key to the downturn in violence that we're seeing now is not so much the surge of 30,000 troops in itself.
So if there's new teams out there with new technology, great.
