"I looked around and I saw this huge whale coming out of the water and smashing against the side of the boat," Werner told CNN.
And while the masts need replacing, Werner said the steel structure of the boat was undamaged.
Werner said she had spoken to a local marine mammal expert who had told her that the incident was a "freak accident."
Werner said the whale appeared to be unhurt by the experience: "We saw it afterwards and there was no blood or anything.
Obviously it's a bonus if you see a whale but we didn't quite count on having one on top of the boat."
