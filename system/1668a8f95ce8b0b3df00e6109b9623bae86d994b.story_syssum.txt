"I need support, I need help because I'm representing Afghanistan -- especially disabled people," says Malek, who more than anything, wants to swim for his country at the 2012 Paralympic Games in London.
Malek's younger brother, Samandar, beams with pride as he watches his sibling swim the length of the pool.
"I don't have any coach or any trainer to teach me how to swim, how to prepare for the games, so I'm doing by myself, because I love swimming," says Malek.
Nikpai, who was swimming in the same pool as Malek when we visited, is keenly aware how difficult it is to excel in athletics in Afghanistan.
That is why we are not hesitating and making every possible effort to compete on the worldwide scale."
Malek has others encouraging him to chase his Olympic dream.
As Malek waits to find out if he's earned a spot at the games, he remains optimistic.
Malek knows that whatever happens, in a sense, he's already won.
