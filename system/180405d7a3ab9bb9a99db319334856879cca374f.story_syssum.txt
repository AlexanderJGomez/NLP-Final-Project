(CNN) -- German medical groups joined the French health ministry Friday in recommending that women seek removal of breast implants made by a French company, saying they need not hurry but the devices could pose eventual health problems.
In Britain, David Nicholson, chief executive of the National Health Service, said an advisory medical group found there was no evidence to support routine removal of the implants or suggestions that they could increase the risk of cancer.
Women who paid for cosmetic implants from private clinics would not be eligible for government funded care in most cases, the NHS said.
The implants are not approved for use in the United States.
