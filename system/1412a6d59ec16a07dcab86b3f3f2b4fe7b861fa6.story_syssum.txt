(CNN) -- Shareholders of the Olympus Corp. approved a new board Friday despite objections from a vocal minority of shareholders seeking new management that can distance the company from the $1.7 billion cover-up that rocked Japan Inc.
The report blasted the culture of the company that allowed the losses to be disguised in dubious fees and overvalued payments for companies, as well as the tight control of ex-Chairman Tusyoshi Kikukawa.
Woodford also questioned Sasa's experience to lead Olympus out from under the shadow of the scandal.
I would like to ask about the reason of my dismissal," Woodford told Japanese media before entering today's meeting.
Meeting with the press yesterday in Tokyo, Woodford said he wanted to shine light on corporate governance in Japan.
Olympus shares lost nearly 80% of its market value in the weeks after Woodford went public with his allegations.
