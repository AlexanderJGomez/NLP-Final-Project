In this excerpt from his memoir Measure of a Man, Greenfield describes how an encounter with an SS guard at Auschwitz led him to pick up a needle and thread for the first time, and how tragedy taught him the power of clothes.
The soldiers asked if we knew any trades, like masonry, carpentry, medicineâ€”that kind of thing.
It was his way of marking me for the Germans as a Jew whose skills they could exploit, as one not to be burned.
I then did something I should not have done, something stupid: I ran.
I snapped my head back over my shoulder and saw the dog closing in.
He snarled and gnashed violently as I struggled to pry him loose.
The two soldiers tromped over to retrieve the dog and make sure he was uninjured.
Whether they wanted me first to perform a simpler task than mechanical work, or whether this was a punishment for trying to flee, I do not know.
But after my sprinting stunt, I was eager to show the Germans I was a hard worker who could be of use.
The face of the pacing soldier at my station flushed red.
He gave me a needle and thread and taught me how to sew a simple stitch.
To this day I still don't know why, but when I got up the courage, I slipped the soldier's shirt on and wore it under my striped prisoner uniform.
They wanted to please the Germans, so some of them would be hard on us so the Germans would not punish them.
When I had my soldier shirt on, however, that did not happen.
The day I first wore that shirt was the day I learned clothes possess power.
Looking back, though, that moment in the camps marked the beginning of the rest of my life.
