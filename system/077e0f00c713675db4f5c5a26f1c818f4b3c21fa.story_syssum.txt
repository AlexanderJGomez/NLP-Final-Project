On the other side of the window, two-year-old Wang Yue -- affectionately known as Yueyue -- lay almost lifeless in bed inside the intensive care unit, with netting around her head and a respirator covering her small face.
Gruesome security camera footage of the accidents and the girl, lying in her own blood, ignored by more than a dozen passersby in a busy market has outraged the nation, stirring an emotional debate on the state of morality in a fast-changing society.
Chen Xianmei, a 58-year-old scavenger who was seen in the video moving Wang to safety, became an instant symbol of understated decency in a nation that many netizens say has become obsessed with climbing up the economic ladder.
"I went to the closest store and asked a young man there if she was his child, but he said no," the newspaper quoted her as saying.
Wang's mother said in tears that she still couldn't comprehend the behavior of the passersby but wanted to focus on the positive.
Despite rising concerns over China's declining morality after the story broke, humanity now shines at the Guangzhou hospital where Wang is being treated.
