Jones, whose real name is Sarah, told the local Stourbridge News that she was stunned by her newfound fame.
I was in the doctor's and people were coming up to me, and at the supermarket and even when I went to fill up with petrol.
The Stourbridge News reported that Jones was a professional dancer in her youth.
From there, the routine becomes even more physical and ends when Nico flips Jones upside down and over his shoulder, drawing a standing ovation from the judges and the crowd.
Before finding fame, the unmarried 48-year-old lived in a modest home in a small town in Scotland with her pet cat.
