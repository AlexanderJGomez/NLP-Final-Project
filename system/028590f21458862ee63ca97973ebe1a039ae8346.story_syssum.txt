Roll's service came a day after a memorial was held for Christina Green, 9, the youngest victim of the mass shooting.
President Barack Obama described Roll as "the hardest-working judge" within the 9th Circuit in a speech Wednesday night at a public memorial at the University of Arizona.
Chief Justice John Roberts said Roll was "a wise jurist who selflessly served Arizona and the nation with great distinction, as attorney and judge, for more than 35 years," McCain said.
The jurist also received criticism recently when he asked to delay bringing felons to trial in Tucson, citing a judicial emergency.
Police said Loughner targeted Giffords and had complained about the lawmaker for years after apparently getting a response he didn't like to a question he asked her at a 2007 event.
All of them passed under a giant American flag that was recovered in the aftermath of the terror attacks in New York on September 11, 2001 -- the day Christina was born.
"All of us -- we should do everything we can do to make sure this country lives up to our children's expectations."
