He could be 78, his beard gray, body frail and his face a leathery road map that traces the unimaginable horrors his family has endured.
Their son Ali -- 19 and a week away from his wedding -- was working on the family stall when one of Baghdad's ubiquitous car bombs targeted the market area.
As the politicians play politics, and the insurgents deal in death, it is people like this who suffer the fallout, as they always do in war.
Together they had three children: a son, also called Ali, now aged three, and daughters Rukkaya, four, and Narjis, eight months.
Today, the walls by the old watermelon stand are scarred by shrapnel.
"We tell them he has gone to paradise and is watching over them, but Ali especially cannot comprehend," says Abu Ali.
His sister seems happy enough, playing on a sofa with her cousin and a tattered doll.
Ali sits nearby, his head dipping and swaying, as it's done ever since his father died.
The family has a fourth son, Ammar, but after the second explosion he fell apart emotionally and was certain that one day he too would die.
They are seven months behind on the rent for their tiny three-room house on a muddy side street.
"They supported us, now I have no income, I have to now sell belongings.
I have lost three sons and the fourth fled and no one cares about us."
We leave Abu Ali and Umm Ali and the grandchildren they now raise and they thank us for telling their story to the world.
