It's usually something presentable, comfortable and preferably in a bright "TV" color that makes my cameraman Rajesh happy.
I did not expect to see people cleaning human waste from the roads right in the heart of Mumbai, a booming financial capital and the face of modern India.
It's called manual scavenging -- the removal of human waste or "night soil" from sites where there is no flush system.
Shinde carries a broom, while his colleague carries a tin plate.
According to various studies, nearly 50% of India's population doesn't have access to toilets -- which leaves them with no choice but to go outdoors.
Another manual scavenger, Sunil Chavan, who works in a different part of Mumbai says he would throw up every day when he started working.
A pair of old sandals leave his feet covered in muck.
Those who clean gutters use bamboo sticks to clear jams, while standing in the middle of waste matter that can come as high as their chest.
Standing next to Shinde while he worked was hard enough -- the smell was repulsive and overwhelming.
According to the Mumbai based research organization Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), 80% of the manual scavengers die before they turn 60 because of health problems.
"They are the most vulnerable section of our society," explains Milind Ranade, a labor activist fighting for the rights of manual scavengers.
A few small tea vendors will serve him a cup of tea provided he stands on the road and does not enter their premises.
His wife jumps in to answer, her eyes brimming with tears.
India's current prime minister, Narendra Modi, hopes to change the future not just for Shinde's daughter but for millions of Indians who are forced to live with unsanitary and unhygienic conditions every day.
Lets hope he delivers on this promise.
