Clough, one of the legends of the British game, had been denied an FA Cup Final with Forest a year earlier, when his side lost to Liverpool at the same stage of the competition and at the same venue.
The match had not long started when the first signs of a major problem surfaced.
Through it hundreds of Liverpool fans had attempted to make their way without realizing the two caged pens it led to were already overcrowded.

They did it in 1989, beating Forest when the semifinal was later replayed, then going on to defeat city rivals Everton after extra time at Wembley.
