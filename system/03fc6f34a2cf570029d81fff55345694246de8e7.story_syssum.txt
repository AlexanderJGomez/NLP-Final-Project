Though they thrived on Earth for more than 360 million years, one in three of the 6,000 recognized amphibian species are now at risk of extinction and as many as 122 species have gone extinct since 1980, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's amphibian specialist group.
"Many have an arsenal of compounds stored in their skin that have the potential to address a multitude of human diseases."
Andrew Blaustein, who began documenting amphibian declines two decades ago, said the loss of species was part of an overall biodiversity crisis.
"The long-term ecological repercussions of their decline could be profound, and we have to do something about it."
