The initial picture released on Tuesday shows a couple of orange-tinged blobs: Pluto and its largest moon, Charon.
"In an unprecedented flyby this July, our knowledge of what the Pluto system is really like will expand exponentially, and I have no doubt there will be exciting discoveries," said John Grunsfeld, an astronaut and associate administrator of the NASA Science Mission Directorate.
By discovering more about Pluto and its moons, New Horizons will shed light on a little-known third zone of the solar system, beyond the rocky planets and the gas giants.
It will also be on the lookout for rings and other satellites.
