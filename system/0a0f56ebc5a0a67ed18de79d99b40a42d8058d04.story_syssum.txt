The man, whose name was not released, had been seriously injured in the crash Thursday in the town of Apeldoorn, about 45 miles east of Amsterdam, police said.
Crowds had lined the streets to see Queen Beatrix and her family ride by in an open-top bus during the Netherlands' annual holiday.
The crowds were behind barriers off the road, but security officials and journalists, including many cameramen, were in the road as the car went by.
Members of the royal family saw the crash and gasped, then quickly sat down as the bus continued driving.
And will we continue to see the members of the royal family cycling through the canals of Amsterdam or hunting for bargains in the Bijenkorf in The Hague?"
Queen's Day is known for its free market all over the country, where anybody is allowed to sell things in the streets.
The day is marked with the color orange all over the country as a reference to the colors of the royal family, who come from the House of Orange-Nassau.
