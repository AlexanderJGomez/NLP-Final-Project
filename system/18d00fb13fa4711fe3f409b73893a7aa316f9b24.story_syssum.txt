The Wiggles, an Australian band, impart lessons through their songs and performances that some mothers happily admit have helped shape their little ones' views on life.
Three of the four founding members of the Wiggles met one another at the Macquarie University Institute for Early Childhood Studies in Sydney.
Live shows are an important part of Wiggles culture; Brendan Lane has been to 41 shows.
Cato says that because of her daughter's disabilities, Catie "doesn't really show a lot of preference for things.
Catie, who is 16, has met the Wiggles several times because of the band's practice of holding personal meet-and-greets with disabled or sick children.
It's understandable that children developed such an attachment to Page; he was the voice of the Wiggles for so long.
By many accounts, though, Page's replacement Sam Moran seems to be holding up well as the Wiggles new lead man.
Some would say that Wiggles mania has reached fever pitch.
"And then to see them perform at Madison Square Garden, it was amazing."
