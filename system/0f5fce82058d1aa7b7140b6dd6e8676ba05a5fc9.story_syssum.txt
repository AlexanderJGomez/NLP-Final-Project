The United States is making a deal with a country in the eastern Africa region to hold and try pirates captured by the U.S.-led Combined Task Force 151, a new maritime anti-piracy mission started earlier this month.
As of mid-January, the attack numbers are already at the average of the past three months, according to Gortney.
Pirates attacked nearly 100 vessels and hijacked as many as 40 in the waters off the coast of Somalia in 2008, according to the International Maritime Bureau.
Additionally, pirates are able to get away with the crimes because of the lack of government and overall lawlessness in the country.
