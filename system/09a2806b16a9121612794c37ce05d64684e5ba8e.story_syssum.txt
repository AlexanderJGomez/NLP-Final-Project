The Republican/tea party spokesperson said yes, arguing that labor unions were behind it (in fact the labor unions did not join until this week).
The average salary for the rank-and-file American worker, however, is about the same as it was in 1980.
Did our CEOs really get 5 times better than they were in 1980 and our workers remain just ho-hum average?
While President Obama has not done things perfectly, he has injected some fairness and balance into the economy to spur growth and job creation.
This week, we see banks tacking on extra fees -- which, contrary to what they argue, would lead them to 13% more in profits than they were making before the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act went into effect.
And to add insult to injury, Republican legislators and the GOP presidential candidates want to eliminate the protections the middle class gained from the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act passed by Democrats and signed by Obama.
It's no wonder Republicans want less government accountability and more tax giveaways for billionaires and giant companies -- that's what their corporate donors demand.
The second question I was asked this week was whether the demonstrators had a "candidate" in the race.
He knows times are tough and he continues to fight to restore some much-needed protections for exactly the people in that crowd at Wall Street.
It is now time to stand up and fight for fairness for the middle class and a balanced approach for working-class families, who have labored just as hard as America's top CEOs but have not had the same kind of increases in salary.
The majority of job creation comes from our small businesses, none of which are raking in the salaries of the top 1% of wealthy Americans.
With all this taken together, is it any wonder that our masses could be giving rise to our own "spring"?
