The exhibit, called "Ciudad Juarez es the .1," is the work of local artist Abel Saucedo, 24, a recent arts graduate of the University of Texas in El Paso.
The collection, which Saucedo describes as post modern conceptualism, contains four individual pi√±ata sculptures in the shape of cartoon heads a bit larger than life size.
I also filled the pressure gun with red paint so it would drip down the face," Saucedo said.
El Paso Library spokesman Jack Galindo said the library had only one official complaint -- a man said he was "very offended" by the pieces.
Enrique Torres, spokesman for the Mexican state of Chihuahua's Joint Operation said the violence is as brutal as ever.
They used to operate in high profile vehicles and large caliber weapons, now they use low caliber weapons and older model compact vehicles which are harder to detect," said Torres.
