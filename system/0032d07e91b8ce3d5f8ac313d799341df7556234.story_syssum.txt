Mather asks her online agency, Cheapoair.com, for a refund, but more than six months later, she's still out $879.
When we arrived in Mexico City, Aviacsa Airlines representatives told us that Cheapoair hadn't paid for the last leg of our trip.
A: You shouldn't have to pay twice for your airline tickets.
A lot can go wrong when you're dealing with a flight schedule that involves multiple carriers.
I guess offering a toll-free number around the clock doesn't necessarily mean your questions will be answered quickly, but you can't blame me if I'm left with that impression.
You could have avoided a lengthy dance with Cheapoair by taking this up with Aviacsa either when you were flying to Tapachula or returning home.
An airline representative told Cheapoair it would have to speak to the agent who was working at the ticket counter when you checked in, which was impossible.
