Several other verification items also confirmed it, including a tweet from the official Barack Obama Twitter account and a photo on Reddit of the president seated at a plain wooden desk, staring into an Apple laptop in front of a single lamp.
In roughly 30 minutes, Obama waded through hundreds of questions, answering only 10 on a wide range of topics including balancing life and family, and protecting Internet freedom.
Redditors, as they are known in the online community, seemed mostly welcoming.
Others wondered how he came to the decision to participate in an Ask Me Anything or AMA.
User mimicthefrench posted how funny it is to imagine "President Obama sitting in the oval office giggling and looking at photos of cats."
And while they may have allowed the president to get away with not answering a few hundred questions, they did not allow him to get away with incorrect grammar -- he used "their" instead of "there" in one post.
In his last update, Obama thanked everyone for participating while also urging them to vote in November.
