Foreign Policy magazine said in September that Caracas tops the list of five murder capitals of the world, with an official tally of 130 homicides per 100,000 residents.
Foreign Policy is owned by The Washington Post Co. and published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
Still, the rate in Caracas comes in far ahead of the following four murderous capitals.
"It's doubly sad because, primarily, the deaths occur almost exclusively in the poor sectors, and, secondarily, it's among youth under 30 years old."

Welsch lays much of the blame on the 10-year-old government of socialist President Hugo Chavez.
The magazine lists, in descending order, Caracas; Cape Town, South Africa; New Orleans; Moscow, Russia; and Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, as the top five murder capitals in the world.
