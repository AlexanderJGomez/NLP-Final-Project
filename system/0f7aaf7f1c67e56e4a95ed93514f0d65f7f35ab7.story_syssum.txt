The North American Aerospace Defense Command weather department says the streak of light that caused consternation from many most likely was part of a meteor shower.
And someone even claimed on YouTube that he captured footage of the streak of light.
It's just in the middle of nowhere in a totally dark area where there's no houses or anything where anyone would shoot fireworks.
These meteors are generally the most visible in the first half of November, the American Meteor Society says.
