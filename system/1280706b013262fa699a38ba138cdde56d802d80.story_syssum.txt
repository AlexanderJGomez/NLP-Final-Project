Marlon Jackson smiles for photographers at the 8th Annual BMI Urban Awards in September 2008.
Jackson: It was May 14 at a family gathering.
He was getting ready to go into rehearsals for his tour.
Jackson: May 14 was the last time I spoke with him.
Jackson: I've been trying to get a hold of my mom.
I said, "I'm calling them right now to see if it's true."
I talked to him the first time and he was at the house and my mom was in the background crying, and she was just upset.
People are at the hospital, at the Jackson family home in Gary, Indiana, at his star on the Walk of Fame.
Jackson: I never knew the effect the Jackson 5 had on people until I began traveling with a major broadcasting network, and people would say our songs were the reason for them getting married.
Michael was known all over the world, and that's why people care, and it's nice to see that people care.
I know it's very soon after the death of Michael, but should something like Graceland be established so the next generation is aware of Michael's impact?
I want people to concentrate on those things that he did for people.
Jackson: And that's the way we saw him, as a younger brother.
It's like when anyone else loses their family member.
