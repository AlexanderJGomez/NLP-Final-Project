Now, actress Florence Henderson, otherwise known as Mrs. Brady, has a new mission: Helping older adults learn to use technology.
Her new business, Floh Club, is a "telephone-based technical support service" focusing on people who didn't grow up with computers -- especially grandparents who want to stay in touch with family but are intimidated by webcams, Facebook, instant messaging or even e-mail.
And so, a few months ago I decided that if I felt that way, there must be a lot of older adults that feel the same way, or maybe even some younger ones.
I'm taking photos off my camera and actually putting them on the computer.
They are all very patient and very caring, and they will access your computer remotely, and they will talk you through any problem you may be having.
CNN: The plans and services range from $25 to up to $250 for an entire year.
That's one of the most exciting things for me is to be able to videoconference because I have a son and his wife and two children that live in St. Louis.
And so I'm encouraging older adults to really stay connected and use your brain.
But you, 35 years after the show technically ended, you have stayed out there as an icon.
I've always kind of felt that my career was my vocation, and I love staying on top of things.
Henderson: The real story is that he always had a crush on me and he asked me to go on a date with him.
And his brother had to bring him to my hotel, and then he could drive my car, you know, he had a permit.
