(CNN) -- The first day of voting in Egypt's presidential election was relatively quiet, state media reported Monday, though one man connected to a campaign was shot to death.
Public service ads, media campaigns and the electoral ads of the el-Sisi campaign stressed that voting is a patriotic duty.
Abdul Mawgoud Dardery, a spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood, criticized the election: "What you have in Egypt now is not democracy but a militacracy.
A number of people hurled Molotov cocktails at the headquarters of el-Sisi's campaign in the town of Hosh Issa.
"The day has sadly witnessed many violations observed, documented and announced by the campaign, led by banning Sabahy delegates from entering polling centers, collective voting, physical assaults against delegates and lawyers, let alone some cases of intervention by police and army forces," it said in a statement.
