If we could see off camera, we might see Bieber's attorney subtly shaking his head in frustration.
To those luckily unfamiliar with depositions, it may have looked simply like Bieber was being a defiant celebrity in an interview.
A deposition, on the other hand, is the other side's only opportunity to find out what's in your mind, lock your story in writing, and have it ready to bash you over the head with if you testify inconsistently at trial.
An argumentative witness like Bieber is a dream come true for his opponent.
But watch the oozing hostility on the video, and his dramatic "I don't recall" might play to a jury as "I am conveniently forgetting negative evidence."
A witness should only answer the question asked, lest he volunteer information to help the other side.
Depositions are not soapboxes:  At a deposition, you will never "show up" the other side's lawyers.
After hearing this story, I think we're on the wrong side of justice here.
Objection to the objection: Bieber can be heard warning the lawyer not to ask about sensitive subjects, like his possible relationship with other celebrities.
Bieber may not like the questions, but he takes his chances with the judge if he refuses to answer.
Bieber's opponent benefits from each additional word Bieber says, because that's part of another sentence the singer needs to testify consistently with at trial.
In text form, sarcasm doesn't read like sarcasm:  Sarcasm is using words to indicate (sarcastically) the opposite of what you really want to say.
Without the benefit of the voice and visual elements of sarcasm, on paper someone just admitted to shooting the sheriff, when maybe they wanted to be sarcastic.
Of course, some questions are so outside the realm of relevance or civility that the attorney has to intervene.
Bieber appears on the video to really think about the meaning of the questions and his answers.
