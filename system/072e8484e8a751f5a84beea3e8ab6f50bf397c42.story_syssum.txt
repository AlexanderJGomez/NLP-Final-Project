(CNN) -- It seems like the opposite of what you'd expect, but my cancer diagnosis -- a staggering Stage IV colon cancer diagnosis, delivered to me at the age of 28 -- gave me a new lease on life.
I believed that my will to survive, to thrive, to love and laugh and enjoy my life -- would carry me through any physical challenge.
And I will continue to fight until cancer gives up, because there's no way I will.
I manage stress levels and I make sure I always get enough sleep.
By far, the best part of my cancer-killing adventures has been becoming a part of a community of cancer warriors and their loved ones.
My best friend in the cancer world, a fellow warrior and a phenomenal woman named Annette, passed away at the end of last year.
A simple but revolutionary initiative that sees every penny donated going to cutting-edge research that I hope will get us to the cure for colon cancer in under 10 years.
Several months ago, I asked my doctor -- a world-renowned oncologist and researcher at USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center named Heinz-Josef Lenz -- a series of simple questions.
Lenz and his dream team -- scientists and researchers from the United States and abroad -- are sure that they can find the cure for colon cancer if they have the funds to do the necessary large-scale research and drug development that the team has long been known for.
It's my job to start something unprecedented, a global uprising against cancer, focused solely on supporting the groundbreaking research necessary to change the face of cancer forever -- for all of us.
And I will make sure that we seize this opportunity.
And through The Wunder Project, I know it will be.
