Rausing looked frail as he appeared in the courtroom, the news agency said.
"Hans and Marit Rausing and their families are mourning the death of their son's beloved wife, Eva.
The death of his 48-year-old wife remains unexplained pending further tests, police said Friday, but the heiress's previous problems with drugs are well documented.
Kemeny said the best way to remember his daughter would be to carry on her efforts to help those battling addiction, especially women.
"The Kemeny family hopes this tribute will be used to draw attention to the tragedy of drug addiction and to generate awareness and financial support for this cause in the future."
They benefited thousands of lives through their personal involvement and philanthropic activities," Kemeny wrote.
