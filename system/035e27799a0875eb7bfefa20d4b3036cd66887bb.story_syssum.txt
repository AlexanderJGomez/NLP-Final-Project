My-Linh Bui, American Airlines spokeswoman, said the problem was apparently a bird strike.
Bird strike is the term used for incidents in which planes collide with birds.
Considering how small they are compared to a plane, they can cause big problems.
On January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 left LaGuardia Airport and ran into a flock of geese that damaged both engines, forcing the crew to make an emergency landing in the frigid Hudson River.
Rescuers quickly reached the aircraft and found passengers standing on its wings.
