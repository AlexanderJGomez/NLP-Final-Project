Miami (CNN) -- For a war vet from South Florida, a leisurely road trip to a seaside vacation came to an abrupt end in Mexico, where he has languished behind bars for four months, sometimes chained to a bed.
But he also took one item that quickly became troublesome: an antique shotgun handed down from his great-grandfather.
But after he drove his Winnebago a few feet farther to the Mexican side, authorities arrested him, saying the weapon did not comply with their gun laws.
Mexican officials said that the files on the case were not immediately available because the arrest happened so long ago.
U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat from Florida, stepped in on Hammar's behalf, speaking to Mexico's ambassador to the United States.
The Hammars recently turned to their U.S. congresswoman, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who heads the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
"Jonny, we're going to get you out of there," Olivia Hammar said to her son by phone Friday.
Hammar's parents now fear they could lose him just across the border, if they wait too much longer.
