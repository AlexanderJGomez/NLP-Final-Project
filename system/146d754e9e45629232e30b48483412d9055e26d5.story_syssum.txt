Cink, the world number 34, was a surprise winner of the Claret Jug last season, beating veteran Tom Watson in a play-off to land his first major title.
Ranked 33 at the time and with only one previous top-10 finish at the championship, Cink says he was inspired by fellow American Lucas Glover, who shocked better-known rivals to land the U.S. Open title last year.
Cink will playing at a St Andrews Open for the third time and thinks he knows the secret to success on the Old Course.
While Watson will be making another bid for his sixth title at St Andrews, another of the sport's legends won't be there.
Norman has been replaced in the field by his fellow Australian Jason Day, who won the Byron Nelson Championship in May at the age of 22.
