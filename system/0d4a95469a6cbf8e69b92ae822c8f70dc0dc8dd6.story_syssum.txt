At a ceremony at the national stadium, survivors of the genocide recounted their memories of the killings and of their survival.
The events also bore reminders of festering anger as a diplomatic dispute broke out over renewed allegations from Kigali of French complicity in the genocide.
The French Foreign Ministry said that France was "surprised by the recent accusations made by the Rwandan president" and that Justice Minister Christiane Taubira, who had been due to travel to Kigali on Monday, would no longer attend the commemoration.
The killer, Sekamana Musa, served 10 years in prison for that murder and other crimes during the genocide.
Recently, the two men and others went to a spot where Musa believes Rafiki's father was buried.
The violence was triggered by the death of President Juvenal Habyarimana, an ethnic Hutu, in a plane crash April 6, 1994.
Last month, a Paris court sentenced former Rwandan spy chief Pascal Simbikangwa to 25 years in jail for his role in the genocide, the first such conviction in France.
