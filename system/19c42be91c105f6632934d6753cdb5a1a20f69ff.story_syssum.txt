Obama received the five Kennedy Center honorees at the White House before the annual gala that honored this year Tom Hanks, Sting, Al Green, Lily Tomlin and ballerina Patricia McBride.
Sting, however, later said on the red carpet he was "not so sure" his name is cooler than the President's moniker.
There she is, looking radiant, next to the President, which I assume means she has no future plans to run for office," Colbert quipped.
Earlier in the evening Obama also honored Hanks and his cult roles in movies like "Big" -- which Obama said he watched Saturday night -- "Apollo 13" and "Forrest Gump," in which Hanks' character gives another U.S. President, Lyndon B. Johnson, a look at his wounded behind in the movie.
