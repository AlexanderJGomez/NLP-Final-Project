(CNN) -- Before middle-aged men started singing "Viva Viagra" in TV ads, before former Sen. Bob Dole appeared in its commercials in the '90s, before the blue pill with a funny name entered the public lexicon, impotence was hush-hush.
The pill helped more than 25 million men get their groove back and blasted the topic of erectile dysfunction into the open.
"We lamented the fact that the men had so much shame about erectile dysfunction, how rarely anyone came for medical attention," said Dr. Abraham Morgentaler, an associate clinical professor of urology at Harvard Medical School.
Viagra increases blood flow to the penis, enabling a man to have an erection.
Urologists heard from patients who had tried the pill that Viagra made them feel as if they were 20-year-olds again.
Since Viagra's appearance on the market, the dialogue about sexual dysfunctions has helped doctors identify other health problems in their patients, doctors say.
The man's penis is like "the tip of the iceberg" or "the canary in the mines," which serve as an indicator of overall health, Morgentaler said.
Despite the deluge of attention, Viagra doesn't work for about 25 percent to 35 percent of men with erectile dysfunction.
Eating food decreases the potency of Viagra, and some say the pill forces them to go on a schedule.
Even when Viagra is effective, some men realize that it's not the magic bullet that solves their problems with intimacy, doctors said.
"A typical example is a couple where there's been problems over the years and they can't deal with the problems on a verbal level, so they start withdrawing from one another.
Sex, it turns out, is part of a bigger web of relationship issues.
