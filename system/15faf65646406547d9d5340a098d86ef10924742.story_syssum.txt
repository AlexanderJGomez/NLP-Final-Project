(CNN) -- Note to self: When soliciting for drugs on Twitter, try a direct message.
The police forwarded the tweet to an account for a man listed on the board of directors for the repair shop chain.
"Never knew weed smokers are more wanted in society than shooters & rapists.
Since the tweeter named the company, Mr. Lube, and the intersection where his shop was, the chain got involved.
The York Regional Police explained in a later tweet, "If you shouted on a busy street corner about illegal activity & we drove by, we'd intervene.
Think of Twitter as a virtual street corner."
