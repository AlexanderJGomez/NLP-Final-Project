Enter Jason Segel as Sydney Fife, whom Rudd's character, Peter Klaven, pursues on several "man-dates" that end up threatening his relationship with his fianc√©e (Rashida Jones).
But don't call the film a "bromance" in the presence of Rudd and Segel.
Segel has also been in Apatow projects -- including last year's "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" -- and he stars in the TV series "How I Met Your Mother," which finds plenty of humor in male bonding.
"It was a real treat for me, to be honest for a minute, to play this character, because I've played sort of a puppy dog guy in 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall,' and on ['Mother'] I play a husband, you know, a loving husband," he said.
"So to get to play a character who is a bit more of a man of mystery was very exciting for me."
But he quickly turns serious and maintains that "I Love You, Man" does have a message to go along with its comedy.
"Sometimes buddies hold a mirror up to the way you behave in ways that relationships with the opposite sex don't," Rudd said.
"I think that we've all been kind of drawn to real stories, you know, characters that hopefully people can relate to and what's funny about just certain insecurites and just certain things in life.
"Just less fart jokes."
