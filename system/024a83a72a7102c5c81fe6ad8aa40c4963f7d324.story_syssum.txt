Hong Kong (CNN) -- As the attention of the rugby world is drawn to Hong Kong this weekend for the Rugby Sevens, corporations are looking to capitalize on a sport that soon will become an Olympic event.
Even as the bank is cutting tens of thousands of jobs worldwide, HSBC is investing in rugby ahead of the sport's inclusion in the 2016 Summer Olympic Games.
The HK Sevens is a very popular tournament but was much more standalone than it is now," said Giles Morgan, HSBC Group head of Sponsorship and Events.
Morgan quickly defends HSBC's sponsorship as a calculated strategy.
Morgan declined to comment on how much HSBC actually invests in sponsoring this year's Hong Kong Sevens but he says the bank aims for a three-to-one return on sponsorship investment.
Not only that, companies may pay a prestige premium that comes with being a title sponsor for high-profile sporting events because there are so few of them.
"We're looking for sponsorships that really help build Hong Kong and help bring people in to make the city a tourist destination," says Camilla Taylor, Cathay Pacific's Marketing Manager-Events.
While HSBC, Cathay Pacific and other sponsors refuse to divulge their investment or returns, Hong Kong gladly throws its books wide open.
Companies are counting that as thousands descend on the city, more spectators may notice that DHL ad on the Jumbotron in Hong Kong's Central bar district, notice the Cathay Pacific billboard streak by on a Citybus, or notice that red-and-white HSBC banner flutter in the Sevens stadium breeze.
