Scottish side Celtic went into the final qualifying round with a superb 2-0 away win over Dinamo Moscow earlier this week, overturning a 1-0 deficit from the first leg.
A total of 10 pairings were drawn with the prize for the winners a place in the lucrative group stages of the world's most prestigious club competition.
European governing body UEFA effectively ring fenced five places in the group stages for these sides by separating them in the draw from teams from stronger leagues such as England, Italy and Spain.
Shakhtar won the UEFA Cup last season and will now be able to defend their title under the guise of the revamped Europa League.
