Ralph Steinman, a biologist with Rockefeller University, was named a winner Monday of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
"The events that have occurred are unique and, to the best of our knowledge, are unprecedented in the history of the Nobel Prize," the Nobel Assembly said in a statement, announcing that Steinman will remain a Nobel laureate.
In 1996, William Vickrey died days after the announcement that he had won the Nobel Prize in economics.
Monday's announcement about the winners kicked off a week of awards that will also honor achievements in physics, chemistry, literature, peace and economics.
On Tuesday, the committee will announce its award for achievement in physics.
Since 1901, the committee has handed out the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 101 times.
