Six days after Boston's Marathon was rocked by the bombing which killed three people and injured more than 180, the world will be turning its gaze to London's premier race.
In another act of solidarity, for every competitor who crosses the finishing line, race organizers plan to donate $3 to The One Fund Boston, set up to raise money for victims of the blasts.
"It's important to see on mass that we're in it together," said 36-year-old asset management worker, Ed Lucas, who will be running his first ever marathon on Sunday.
"We've no reason to think people are any less safe than they were before the terrible events in Boston," he added.
"You will know from London 2012 last year, this country has a great deal of experience of ensuring our sporting events go well and that security is at the heart of the planning process.
"When you are running and you are thinking something like that can happen, you can't concentrate," the Kenyan told Athletics Weekly.
