On the steep flank of the mountain, a man was bent low to the basalt scree, laboring upward.
Perhaps because his home was getting a little breezy and running low on appliances, he eventually gathered some tools and wood and knocked up the world's very first volcano board, later to belt down the same volcano with more success.
Ahead, a 20-strong scrambling chain of fellow volcano boarders heading to the summit is a shock of orange against the dark basalt -- we're all donned in convict-style luminous jump suits.
hollers Jessie, our dreadlocked guide from Quebec, as she motions to a mass of pale rocks, beneath which steam leaks out into the thick air.
Neither too large nor too small for careering down (roughly 1,500 feet from peak to base), the smooth, denuded conditions on Cerro Negro make it the ideal place for such madness.
A smudge, jet black, covers the eastern side of the mountain -- a cooled lava flow from the 1999 eruption -- while most of the surrounding land is a sultry and baked expanse, so hot it dances.
The city of Leon is below too, the country's largest after the capital, and launching point for tours like this by Bigfoot.
The girl and board crawl off with a sound of wood crunching rock, then momentum builds and she's soon just a soft orange mote chased by a smoky scar, like a jet trail.
Basalt has little in common with other surfaces where you might encounter a board with a thrill-seeker on top -- snow and sand, for example.
I see the spill coming in plenty of time though, and I pull the volcano boarding equivalent of the ejector seat, hurling myself sideways.
A few crash, but nobody stays a crumpled heap or shouts in anything but elation.
On the ride back to Leon I give silent thanks to the inspired people of the world: the ones whose minds run off on all manner of daring tangents, like the flanks of Cerro Negro.
