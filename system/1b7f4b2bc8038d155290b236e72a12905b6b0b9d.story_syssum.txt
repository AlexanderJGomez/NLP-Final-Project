Responding to a question from California Democratic Rep. Judy Chu about his interest in migrant workers, Colbert became uncharacteristically serious , even invoking the words of Jesus, who said that "whatsoever you did for the least of my brothers, you did it to me" (Matthew 25:40).
Christians take Jesus' words as a call to show justice and mercy to those at the very bottom of the social hierarchy.
In the past year, we have held numerous meetings with members of Congress and with White House officials, and we have conducted forums, news conferences and other public events.
While some agricultural operations have become highly mechanized, growing fruits and vegetables is still labor intensive.
So each year, growers hire tens of thousands of undocumented workers to do some of the most backbreaking jobs in America.
(Undocumented immigrants, of course, pay sales taxes, and many pay Social Security and income taxes, though they are ineligible for most public benefits.)
They include securing our borders, fixing our broken legal immigration system and providing an equitable pathway to earned legal status for the currently undocumented.
By mischaracterizing immigration reform as amnesty and open borders (nothing could be further from the truth), pandering to voters' fears and prejudices, and putting short-term political gain ahead of the national interest, they have lost legitimacy in the minds of many.
