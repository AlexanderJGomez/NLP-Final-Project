Officials from the weather service identified at least 45 separate tornadoes in last week's deadly outbreak across the Midwest and South.
The strongest tornado appears to be the one that hit Henryville, Indiana, with maximum winds at 175 mph.
The twister rated EF-4 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, which weather service officials use to measure the intensity of tornadoes and the damage they are likely to cause.
The EF-3 tornado that struck the small town of West Liberty, Kentucky, packed winds of 140 mph and stuck to the earth for 95 miles -- 60 miles in Kentucky and 35 miles into West Virginia.
Just 20 miles south of West Liberty, another long-track EF-3 tornado swept through Salyersville, Kentucky, packing 160 mph winds.
The 45 twisters confirmed by the weather service were among 144 reports of tornadoes, which may include multiple reports of the same tornado, in last week's outbreak, which started Friday.
The tornado with the longest recorded path in U.S. history was the Tri-State Tornado of 1925, which was rated an F-5 on the Fujita scale -- the previous model for tornado intensity -- and was on the ground for 219 miles over a 3Â½-hour period.
