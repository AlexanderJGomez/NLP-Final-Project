"For 20 years, I've been looking through a microscope, and every time I see things I haven't seen before," said van Egmond, who has had 19 images recognized as finalists in the competition over the past decade.
The view through the microscope was like "exploring a different world, or exploring space, with these strange unknown organisms," he said.
He had long been intrigued by the Chaetoceros debilis, a plant-like plankton with a corkscrew form and bristles.
Previous entries in the contest, now in its 39th year, have included a mosquito's heart, a flea's head, and a pregnant aphid.
