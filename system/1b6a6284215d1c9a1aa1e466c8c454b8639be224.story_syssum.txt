Oranjestad, Aruba (CNN) -- Aruban prosecutors plan to release Tuesday the results of tests conducted on a jawbone found on an island beach and disclose whether it belongs to missing U.S. teenager Natalee Holloway, officials said.
Holloway's dental records were sent to the forensic institute last week, according to the FBI.
Part of a jawbone with a tooth was found earlier this month by an American tourist near the Phoenix Hotel, a large resort on the western side of the island, Aruban prosecutor Peter Blanken said.
However, "it does not appear to be human," said Richard Roy, general manager of the Westin Hotel.
He is now awaiting trial in Lima, Peru, on a murder charge in the death of Peruvian student Stephany Flores.
A surveillance camera captured images of the two entering the room .
