The 29-year-old allegedly choreographed an attack intended to blind Bolshoi artistic director Sergei Filin, the man who put him in the roles of Ivan the Terrible and Swan Lake's evil genius.
Two alleged co-conspirators have been detained: Alleged hit man Yuri Zarutsky -- a burly, bearded Russian who was previously convicted of beating someone to death -- and Andrey Lipatov, who allegedly drove the getaway car after Zarutksy's battery acid attack on Filin.
Filin, 42, was promoted to the Bolshoi Theatre's coveted post in March 2011, shortly after the deputy ballet director, Gennady Yanin, who was widely seen as a favorite for the artistic director post, resigned when pornographic pictures of him surfaced online.
RIA Novosti reported that before the attack, Filin suffered months of intimidation, including threatening phone calls.
As Filin entered the security code at the door of his Moscow apartment, authorities say, Zarutsky confronted him and tossed the sulfuric acid into his face.
The three men faced a judge Thursday, who ordered that they be kept in police custody until the investigation is over.
She says she's going to follow Filin's plans and she believes the dancers will now be united by greater respect and care for each other.
His colleagues are now working to ensure his artistic vision isn't lost.
