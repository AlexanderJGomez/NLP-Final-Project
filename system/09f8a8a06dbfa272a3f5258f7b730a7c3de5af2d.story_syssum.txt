While it is considered a delicacy in Japan and some other countries, meat from whale -- an endangered species -- cannot be sold legally in the United States.
Armed with a hidden camera, the two women captured the waitress serving them whale and horse meat and identifying them as such, a federal criminal complaint said.
The women snuck pieces of the meat into a napkin and later sent them for examination to a researcher at Oregon State University.
Fish and Wildlife Services and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration observed the activists asking for "kujira" or whale meat.
"Someone should not be able to walk into a restaurant and order a plate of an endangered species," said U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr.
In the early 1980s, the International Whaling Commission determined that there should be a moratorium on commercial whale hunting.
Critics say that Japan's research is actually a pretext for retrieving whale meat to be sold in markets and restaurants.
