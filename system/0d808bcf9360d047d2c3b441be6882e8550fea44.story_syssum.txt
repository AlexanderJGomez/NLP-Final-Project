Images of six-pack abs and neon sports bras from the Zumba infomercials she had watched flashed through her mind.
Zumba is a Latin-inspired dance fitness class that blends booty shaking with international music and an intense calorie burn.
Tomsche was an overweight child, but it wasn't until her best friend committed suicide when she was 16 that she started packing on the pounds.
Every time she binged on junk food, she felt sick and swore she'd never do it again.
Instead she came home right after work to snack in front of the TV.
"She would go and sit down about a third (of the) way into class," Venegas says.
Venegas teaches seven Zumba classes a week in Arkansas City in addition to working as an office manager and professional photographer.
Tomsche loves Zumba so much she didn't even realize at first she was losing weight.
Giving up junk food has been hard, but she splurges occasionally on thin-crust pizza or Nutella on whole wheat waffles.
I'm not out of breath when I walk up and down the halls at work, and even sleeping is easier since I don't have all that excess weight pressing down on me."
"I never thought coming from a town of 12,000 (people) that I would be an inspiration for anyone," she says.
