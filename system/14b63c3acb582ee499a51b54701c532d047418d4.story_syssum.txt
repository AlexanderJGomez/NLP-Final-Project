Give your mom something she really needs -- the gift of good health.
"Offer to be your mom's health buddy," says Philadelphia-based women's health expert Dr. Marie Savard, author of several books, including Ask Dr. Marie: Straight Talk and Reassuring Answers to Your Most Private Questions.
"Promise to be there for any and all doctor's visits whether a mammogram or routine appointment," she said.
"Nutritionists can really tailor their advice to whatever issues mom is having with her diet, including losing weight or learning how to eat to reduce her risk of certain diseases such as breast cancer or osteoporosis," Greene says.
Greene also suggests subscribing to a healthy-cooking magazine to keep your mom in the healthy-eating mindset all year.
"Put a folder together of test results and vital information so it is all in one place," she said.
Make sure to include a list of all of her medications and what times she takes them.
"We know that restorative sleep is critical to our immune system and heart health."
Instead of a gourmet gift basket filled with cheese and crackers or sweets, make your own healthy gift basket for your mom, suggests Savard.
"A pedometer, some arm weights, and maybe a tape measure can also be part of this gift," Savard says.
"When your mom gets the gift, she will be notified that it will benefit the chosen charity," Kassan said.
"We have a few breast cancer charities on the site and they all do well on Mother's Day."
"This way you can satisfy her sweet tooth and benefit her heart," she said.
