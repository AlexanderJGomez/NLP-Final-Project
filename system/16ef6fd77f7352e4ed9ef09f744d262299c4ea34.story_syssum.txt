Attorney McGregor Scott admitted it has been a difficult transition for Dugard and her two children -- who police say were fathered by her captor -- given her captivity spanned more than half her life and was the only world she knew for so long.
Scott also said that because of Phillip Garrido's previous criminal history, which includes a kidnapping and rape charge for which he was registered as a sex offender, Garrido would automatically receive a sentence of 25 years to life if he were found guilty on only one felony charge.
Scott said Dugard's daughters, who police said never went to school or a doctor, were receiving tutoring.
He also said they had received donations of more than $100,000 from the public, which would help the girls as they get older.
"To watch the interaction between Jaycee and her mother ... after 18 years is remarkable," Scott said.
