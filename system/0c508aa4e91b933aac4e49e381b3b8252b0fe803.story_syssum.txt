The state-run Antara News Agency had said that two people were reportedly killed when a 12-bus convoy carrying employees of PT Freeport was attacked by unidentified gunmen in the country's eastern-most province.
"No shots were fired at the PT-FI bus convoy as earlier reported," the company said.
They have criticized the environmental impact of the mining operations and the small share of revenues the province receives.
Analysis of their DNA matched those obtained from a homemade explosive found in a room at the Marriott where they had checked in, police said.
