At one point, Jobs turned toward the audience and seemed to ask a question of one of his technical directors: "Got any suggestions?"
Many tech bloggers and writers have called for Apple to open the iPhone to other networks, including Verizon Wireless.
But, if nothing else, they do symbolize the growing frustration some phone consumers have over the lack of choice among wireless carriers.
Analysts said Jobs was having trouble connecting to a Wi-Fi network during his presentation, not AT&T's troubled 3G network.
In a joking yet stern tone, he asked reporters and conference attendees to stop using Wi-Fi networks so that he could finish the presentation.
If the attendees didn't comply, he said, he would simply not be able to show off the rest of the iPhone 4's new features, including its higher-resolution screen, improved camera and video chat functionality -- which, by the way, is only available over Wi-Fi.
