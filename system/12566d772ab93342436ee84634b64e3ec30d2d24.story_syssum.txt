Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Reeva Steenkamp told Oscar Pistorius she was afraid of him and his temper less than three weeks before he shot and killed her, the judge in his murder trial was told Monday.
She reached the exit before he did, she wrote, adding: "I didn't think you would criticize me for doing that, especially so loudly that others could hear....
Moller's testimony came after a neighbor of Pistorius said on the witness stand that she heard "terrified, terrified screaming" the morning the Olympian killed his girlfriend.
Stipp described hearing a series of three shots, a woman screaming, also a man screaming, and then three more shots before the screaming stopped.
Pistorius first achieved global fame as an outstanding double amputee sprinter who ran with special prostheses that earned him the nickname "Blade Runner."
Pistorius also could get five years for each of two unrelated gun indictments and 15 years for a firearms charge he also faces.
The sentence for culpable homicide is at the judge's discretion.
