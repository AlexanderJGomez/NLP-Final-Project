If you use an Android smartphone, you are now 2.5 times more likely to encounter malware (malicious software) than you were six months ago.
Whether you opt to pay for mobile security, use a free service or manage it yourself, you should be aware of the risks and use basic mobile safety skills.
Furthermore, mobile malware and spyware can pull sensitive data from your phone -- such as your credit card numbers, online banking or e-mail account login credentials or your contacts list.
On the bright side, Android's openness has made it easier for vendors to offer cheaper smartphones (especially without costly two-year contracts) to a much broader consumer market.
But the closed nature of those platforms does make it harder for cybercriminals to infiltrate those devices with malware.
"We've observed that most mobile users are far more trusting about how they download and install software on their phone, compared to their computer," he said.
"Personal computers have lots of power -- both energy and processing capacity -- so it's easy to run security analyses in that environment.
This concept formed the genesis of Lookout's Mobile Threat Network, which provides mobile device security through an online platform that aggregates and constantly scans anonymized data gathered from over 700,000 mobile apps.
Because of this complexity, on many phones system updates lag behind -- sometimes far behind -- the latest "flavor" of Android (currently 2.3 "Gingerbread" for phones).
So some cheaper phones simply are not able to run the latest version of Android well, or at all.
Malware can cause a lot of surreptitious activity on your phone, so battery performance might be a clue.
