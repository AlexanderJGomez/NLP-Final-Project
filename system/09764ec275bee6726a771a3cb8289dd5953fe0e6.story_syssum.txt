New York (CNN) -- About a half-dozen bikers accused of beating an SUV driver last weekend used their helmets to attack him and kicked his head and body as he lay on the ground, New York police said.
The driver of the SUV suffered two black eyes and cuts on his face and side, requiring stitches, the criminal complaint said.
He said Chance and Mieses are also victims in the case, and he urged prosecutors to call a grand jury to investigate Lien.
Lien was in his Range Rover on his way back from an outing to celebrate his wedding anniversary with his wife and their 2-year-old daughter.
Lien stepped on the gas, plowing into three more bikers, including Mieses, who was critically injured.
A biker, who police identify as Chance, smashed the driver's side window with his helmet.
Afterward, some of the bikers dragged Lien from the vehicle and beat him, police said.
He has hired a lawyer and is being investigated by the New York Police Department's internal affairs unit.
They arrested Cruz, 28, the biker who abruptly slowed in front of the Range Rover.
A second biker, who was in custody, was released Wednesday, when authorities determined that he may have been trying to help.
The NYPD released photos Sunday of two other men they want to find and question as part of the investigation and asked for the public's help in identifying them.
"My husband was forced under the circumstances to take the actions that he did in order to protect the lives of our entire family," his wife said.
"That wasn't fear, that was aggression -- he ran over three bikes," a man who identified himself as Jose told reporters Thursday night.
"We are not here to blame anyone, we are not here to point any fingers," Albert Elkerson said.
