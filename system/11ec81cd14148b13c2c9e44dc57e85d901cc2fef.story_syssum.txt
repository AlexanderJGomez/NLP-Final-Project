The Swiss Federal Council says it doesn't necessarily want to end the country's liberal laws, which allow someone to assist a suicide as long as they are not motivated by their own interests.
Recent cases have drawn more attention to "suicide tourism," in which people who can't legally seek assisted suicide in their home countries travel to Switzerland, where it is allowed.
Purdy, who has said she wants the option of assisted suicide if her condition deteriorates, wanted to know at what point her husband might be prosecuted if he accompanied her to an assisted suicide clinic.
The first option would ensure that the person committing suicide is doing it of their own free will, and that the person assisting them is not driven by personal gain.
For those with chronic or mental illnesses, the council said it supports "comprehensive treatment, care and support, in the sense of palliative medicine" rather than suicide.
"This option rests on the belief that individuals working in assisted suicide organizations are never actually motivated by purely altruistic reasons, and may develop a close relationship with the suicidal person," the council says.
"Individual patient autonomy has to be balanced against the need to protect potentially vulnerable people," the group said in a statement Thursday.
