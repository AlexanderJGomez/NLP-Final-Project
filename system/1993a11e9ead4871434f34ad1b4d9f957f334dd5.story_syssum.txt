Some Republican lawmakers and a handful of Democrats are calling for a travel ban on people from the West African countries most affected by the disease.
Rick Perry is joining calls for a travel ban after two nurses at the hospital contracted the disease.
The U.S. has not banned people from a certain country from coming to the U.S. because of an epidemic.
Today, more than 1.1 million people are HIV positive.
And while some have stoked fears that the disease could go airborne, the World Health Organization and other experts have said the chances that could happen are near to nil and are unaware of a virus that has ever mutated in that way.
And the United States never banned travel from China, the epicenter of the 2003 SARS outbreak, which tallied roughly the same number of cases -- over 8,000 -- in the same seven-month period as the Ebola epidemic.
Rep. Tim Murphy, who led the house panel that sharply questioned top health officials over Ebola on Thursday, insisted airport screenings aren't enough to keep people out of the country -- especially since infected people can carry  the disease for up to 21 days without showing any symptoms.
But a ban might actually make things worse, he said, because it could encourage people to lie about their travel to West Africa.
But it's not clear how effective those bans are at keeping West Africans out in a region known for especially porous borders.
The ban would especially hurt efforts in West Africa to contain the disease, where foreign health care workers have been central to the fight against the epidemic.
Preventing the disease from spreading further in West Africa is crucial to keep Ebola from continuing to spread.
