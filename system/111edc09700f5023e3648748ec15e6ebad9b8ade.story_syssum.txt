(CNN) -- London's new superyacht hotel is so enormous that when it first arrived in the city, authorities had to lower the water level by five meters just to fit it under a bridge.
"You cannot refer to these rooms as simply cabins," says Nowacka, opening the door to one of the top-of-the-range executive suites, featuring its own sauna and a balcony big enough for 20 people.
In a place with some of the most expensive property prices in the world, the Sunborn Superyacht Hotel has turned its gaze to London's many waterways -- and it's not the first European city in the company's sights.
The hotel itself is attached to the land by two huge supporting arms, and connected to the electricity and sewerage mains.
"This superyacht hotel creates a new set of symbols for the area -- in terms of the wealth it represents, it's a huge change, " said Georgina Young, senior curator at the Museum of London.
