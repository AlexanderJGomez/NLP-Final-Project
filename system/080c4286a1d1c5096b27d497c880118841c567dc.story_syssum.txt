He's a big hit not because of what he sold but because he's given dozens of them what he couldn't afford as a young man: an education at Rhode Island's Brown University.
"The world of difference that he made for each and every one of us is unbelievable, incredible," one of the Frank Scholars, 22-year-old Shane Reil, said Sunday.
The gift was the largest single one ever given to Brown and one of the largest ever given for undergraduate scholarships in the United States, according to the school.
"I sat in this guy's office ... and he said, '$37,000 for tuition,' " Reil recalled.
"She was crying so much, we had to sit in the car for so long because she couldn't drive.
Like many other schools, Brown used to factor a family's ability to pay when deciding whether to accept students.
She received a degree in education with a concentration in human development and will pursue a master's in secondary social studies and history at Brown.
"Just teaching right after college ... might not have been as appealing if I had loans to worry about," Reyes Castro said.
When Brown gave him an honorary degree in 2005, not long after his gift and months before his January 2006 death, people gave him a hero's welcome, she said.
As for the Brown scholarship fund, he started it because he saw that Brown had changed the course of his life, Halstead said.
"He really wanted kids who were coming from very economically challenged backgrounds to have the chance to make it all the way through," said Halstead, who attended Sunday's graduation ceremony.
