As the daughter of John Hardy -- who set up Bali's Green School to educate a new generation of environmentally responsible students -- she and her team of designers and architects are also committed to changing common perceptions of what sustainability means.
Centered around a communal area but separated by discreet gardens, the villas are open to the elements adding to each of the homes' sense of space and light and affording some beautiful views of the surrounding forests and rushing Ayung river below.
Wijaya's next project is to build a house with a 15-meter roof span -- twice as big as the largest so far -- and without any central columns.
Much like any other house anywhere, some running repairs have to be made on small non-structural pieces of the homes.
But the magnificent designs show another side of bamboo that those connected to the project, like Operational Director Patrick How, hope will be a greater legacy.
