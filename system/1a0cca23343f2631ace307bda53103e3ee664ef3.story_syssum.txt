Kathleen Sebelius was sworn in Tuesday night as secretary of Health and Human Services.
She steps into the role as swine flu numbers climb worldwide.
In most cases where a position is awaiting Senate confirmation, that job is filled by a career civil servant in an interim capacity.
Tiller and his staff attended a 2007 reception Sebelius held at the governor's mansion in Topeka.
In vetoing the measure last April, Sebelius wrote that the bill was problematic because it included no exceptions for pregnancies that endanger a woman's life and it allowed individuals to seek court orders preventing a woman from obtaining an abortion, even if the procedure was necessary to save her life.
Former Senate GOP leader Bob Dole, also from Kansas, testified on Sebelius' behalf in March, arguing that her record had proven her ability to work in a bipartisan manner.
Former Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, Obama's first choice for secretary of health and human services, withdrew on February 3 after controversy erupted over his tax records and over his work in a field that some consider lobbying.
