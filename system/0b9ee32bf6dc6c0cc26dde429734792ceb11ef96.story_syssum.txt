TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Given the magnitude of Japan's recession, it should perhaps come as little surprise that the fantasy-obsessed animation industry has received a hard dose of reality.
Unlike some big screen animated features from the United States that rely almost completely on computer animation, in Japan, almost all features are drawn by hand -- a labor-intensive craft practiced by thousands of young artists each year.
It is one of the lowest paid positions in the animation hierarchy.
In Tokyo, the world's most expensive city, that means living in cramped conditions.
At the Tokyo Animation Institute, the classrooms are filled with students honing the craft, faces close to their sheets of paper, the only sound a hum from the electric pencil sharpener.
"If someone is thinking of doing this just because they love drawing, that's called a hobby.
They'd better think of doing something else."
