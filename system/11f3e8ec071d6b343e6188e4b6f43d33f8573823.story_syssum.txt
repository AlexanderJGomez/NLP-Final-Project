Many details of the attack were still unfolding, but the sight of dozens of emergency vehicles and police spread across the wooded campus made it clear Sandy Hook Elementary School has become the nation's latest infamous crime scene.
In the hours following the morning attack, parents rushed to the school after first hearing the news.
She said the message wasn't clear about the school where the incident had occurred.
Like Wasik, other parents wrapped their arms around their children as they hurried away from the scene.
"I was in the gym at the time," student Brendan Murray told CNN affiliate WABC.
Brendan said he later joined classmates and ran to the firehouse "really quick.
"There's no theological answer to this.
Others were openly weeping into their phones as they walked up a wooded roadway leading away from the school.
Earlier, a woman who lives near the firehouse described seeing "a bunch of children with a bunch of adults" apparently evacuating toward a nearby park.
They marched in a line -- one behind another -- with their hands resting on the shoulders of the children in front of them.
In the room with her were the school's principal, vice principal and the psychologist.
Later the parent said she saw two adults lying dead in the hallway, in a pool of blood.
"It doesn't seem possible," said another parent.
At the Stone River Grill, just a few blocks away from Sandy Hook, residents sat quietly watching TV news announce every dark detail of the tragedy.
Also at the restaurant was Tracy Ryan, who teaches at another elementary school.
People are sharing their concern and sadness over the Newtown school shooting.
CNN's David Ariosto and Susan Candiotti reported from Newtown, Connecticut, Terry Frieden and John King reported from Washington and Thom Patterson and Meredith Artley reported from Atlanta.
