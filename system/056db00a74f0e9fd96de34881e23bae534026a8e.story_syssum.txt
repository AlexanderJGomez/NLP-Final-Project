Archerd died Tuesday at Los Angeles Medical Center of a rare form of mesothelioma, a type of lung cancer thought to be the result of his exposure to asbestos in the Navy during World War II.
Archerd's wife of 39 years, Selma, told Variety, "He didn't expose secrets about other people -- he wrote news.
"Army's finest hour was his courageous stand against the blacklist at a time when almost all other Hollywood columnists were red-hunting," said Peter Bart, vice president and editorial director of Variety.
When his family moved to Los Angeles, Archerd transferred to UCLA and, after graduation in 1941, he began work in the mailroom at Paramount Studios.
Archerd often used his power to support his favorite causes, including the Simon Wiesenthal Center and Holocaust awareness.
Archerd was president and founder of the Hollywood Press Club and received honors from that group and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, as well as Newsman of the Year from the Publicists Association.
