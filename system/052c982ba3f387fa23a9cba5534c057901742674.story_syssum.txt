But for the parents of the hundreds of thousands of children who go missing each year, that pain is much deeper; for some, there is never relief.
She'd left home without her parents' permission to meet up with a boy she connected with online.
The boy said he never went to their rendezvous point, a park, and as of Thursday, the young girl still had not come home.
It was frustrating because the family did not think she intended to be gone long.
When word got out, the community rallied around the missing teen and her family.
We plastered the city with fliers and canvassed her last known whereabouts.
We "guessed" the parents should speak first, before things got too emotional.
About an hour before it was to begin, the young girl was located.
There were hugs, tears, and then the exhaustion and gravity of the week hit.
After this experience, I'll never look at news of a missing child the same.
