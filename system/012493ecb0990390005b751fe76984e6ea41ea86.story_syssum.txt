Stephen Schwarz has received a grant and low-interest loan from the state to help keep his business going.
His restaurant is in the city's uptown area, near the riverbend, for those familiar with the city's quirky geography.
But in the past few years, a city that prides itself on amazing cuisine has seen a healthy spike in its number of restaurants.
But the recession is putting the brakes on the number of people with disposable income heading to New Orleans.
"It's a matter of how much stamina we can have, and how long we can last before things turn around," he says.
"In the last year, it really got to the point where catering is 40 percent of our business," Schwarz says.
"Word of mouth is very important, because if you get one bad review, there are tons of restaurants that people are just waiting to try," she says.
Unlike some areas of the country that have seen the economy collapse in a matter of weeks, Schwarz says New Orleans is coping with a gradual decline.
He says he's proud that New Orleans residents tend to turn their backs on chain restaurants.
