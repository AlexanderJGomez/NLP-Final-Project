(CNN) -- Experience eventually overcame youthful promise at the Indian Wells Masters on Tuesday, as tennis legend Roger Federer battled to a third-round win over rising star Milos Raonic.
"I guess my experience helped me to stay calm and just weather the storm," the 30-year-old third seed told the tournament's official website.
The second seed, runner-up here last year, will face Ukrainian 21st seed Alexandr Dolgopolov in the last 16 as he heads towards a semifinal showdown with Federer.
Istomin earned a clash with Argentina's 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro, who maintained his quest for a second title of 2012 by beating Spanish 19th seed Fernando Verdasco.
In the women's draw, Serbia's Ana Ivanovic booked a place in the quarterfinals by winning the battle of the former world No.
The top two seeds remain on track for a final showdown after both Azarenka and three-time grand slam champion Maria Sharapova won, against Germany's Julia Gorges and Italian Roberta Vinci respectively.
Next up for Belarus' Azarenka is Polish fifth seed Agnieszka Radwanska, who benefited from the retirement of American wildcard Jamie Hampton due to cramps in the third and deciding set of their match.
