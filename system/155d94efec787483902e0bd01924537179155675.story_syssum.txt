Though the group said in a statement the boost came from a consolidation with other charities under the foundation, the jump could also be seen as the foundation moving to up its endowment and put itself on better footing in case Hillary Clinton runs for president in 2016.
The foundation does disclose a range of their donors online -- though they are not legally obligated to -- but the names of these donors are blacked out on the tax filing.
And now at least one conservative group, America Rising PAC, is calling on Clinton to detail the foundation's expenses to reveal whether the Clintons' politically-related travel during the 2014 midterms was funded by the nonprofit organization.
When Clinton served as secretary of state, the foundation pledged to disclose their donors and stopped holding events overseas in order to avoid conflict of interest claims between her role and the foundations.
