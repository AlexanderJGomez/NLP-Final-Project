(CNET) -- Now that stereo Bluetooth has become a common feature in a lot of music phones, it's no surprise that stereo Bluetooth headsets have become quite popular as well.
The Jabra BT3030 consists primarily of a small remote control unit housed in a dog-tag style pendant.
The 3.5mm headset jack is on the right spine, while the charger jack is on the bottom.
Aside from using the Jabra BT3030 for music, you can also use the it to make calls via the last number redial or voice command.
Other features include call-waiting support, the ability to reject calls, plus the ability to transfer calls from the headset to the phone, and vice versa.
While we heard our callers just fine, we did have to bring the pendant close to our mouths for callers to hear us.
It has a rated battery life of 8 hours talk time, 7 hours music streaming, and 9.58 days standby time.
