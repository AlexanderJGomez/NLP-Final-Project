For the results to be binding, more than 30% of Facebook users had to participate in the vote, which was hosted on the site by a third-party app developer.
In his blog post announcing the vote last week, Facebook vice president of communications Elliot Schrage said, "If turnout is less than 30%, the vote will be advisory."
The social network also wants to drop the voting system, which it established in 2009 as a response to privacy concerns.
But unless 299 million virtual votes were somehow misplaced, the results are clear.
