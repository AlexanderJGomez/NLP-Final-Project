Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti introduced striker Didier Drogba, who had an overnight illness, after the break and it sparked an improvement by his side after a lifeless first half.
Cech prevented his team from going three down when he stretched out a leg to deny Dirk Kuyt before Chelsea nearly cut the deficit only for Nicolas Anelka's strike to hit the crossbar.
Arsenal were hoping to regain second spot in the standings ahead of Manchester United, but a goal from in-form striker Andy Carroll just before halftime sealed victory for Chris Hughton's men.
Cesc Fabregas rattled the crossbar with a first half free kick and Theo Walcott hit the woodwork after the break, but a miserable afternoon for the Gunners was complete when Laurent Koscielny was sent off in added time.
The win takes Roberto Mancini's men level on points with Arsenal as they stay in the Champions League places after 11 rounds.
