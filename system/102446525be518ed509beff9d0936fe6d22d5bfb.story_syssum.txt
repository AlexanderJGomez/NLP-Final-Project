(CNN) -- A police helicopter crashed into the roof of a pub crowded with Friday-night revelers in the Scottish city of Glasgow, trapping a number people under the debris, rescuers and witnesses said.
"Given an incident of this scale we must all prepare ourselves for the likelihood of fatalities," the head of the Scottish government, Alex Salmond, said in a post on his official Twitter account.
"Until the emergency services got there, everyone who was at the scene just tried to do their best to help all those who were trapped and injured," he said.
Maclean said she was sitting at the back of the bar next to an older man, who suffered a cut on his head from the debris when crash occurred.
The noise came after the crash, when people began calling out for friends.
After the sound of impact, she saw smoke and people running from the pub.
Hours after the crash, the helicopter -- bearing the word "police" on its damaged tail -- was still smoldering.
The Clutha's Facebook page contained numerous posts from people concerned about the incident.
"My thoughts are with everyone affected by the helicopter crash in Glasgow -- and the emergency services working tonight," he said.
