Law enforcement credited the media for keeping the case out front -- and an Austin Labrador retriever who found the convict's skull in a field and brought it back home.
Marshal Robert R. Almonte said, gesturing toward the dog and his owner, who were at the press conference.
Two months later, staff members allegedly caught Stoeser using a smart phone which had images of underage children, authorities said Monday.
Remains of another suspect featured on the "The Hunt" were also found earlier this year, and another suspect who was profiled on the show was killed in a gunbattle with authorities.
He died in a shootout in New York City as police closed in on him.
