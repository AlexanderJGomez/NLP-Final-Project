He said the gunman then turned away from him, distracted by gunfire from the civilian police officers who had rushed to the scene.
Still convinced there were other shooters, Richter said that after Hasan was felled by the police fire, he grabbed Hasan's handgun off the ground and prepared to fire it himself at any additional attackers.
Sources close the prosecution later clarified that he was referring only to those found inside the building where the shooting began.
One of them, Maj. Mark Todd, testified that he found extra magazines and a second handgun, a revolver, after Hasan was shot four times.
In addition to the sound of sirens wailing and fast driving on the way to the scene, the video shows Munley dashing out of her vehicle and bystanders pointing to where the shooter was.
A separate police car "dash-cam" was introduced during Todd's testimony, but because of a technical glitch there was no audio.
After she was wounded three times, Munley was on the ground and her police weapon "malfunctioned," she testified.
He did not shoot her again and Munley said he appeared to be having problems with his own weapon.
The defense spent longer in cross-examining Munley than any of the other more than 50 witnesses heard so far in this Article 32 hearing, pointing up small differences between her testimony and what she told investigators immediately after the shootings.
He also explained that he had two gun sights to help him shoot accurately: a red laser gunsight for low-light conditions and a second green laser, which is most effective in sunlight.
The investigating officer, Col. James Pohl, who acts as the presiding judge in the case, said he would receive the autopsy reports only to identify the victims and their cause of death.
A pause of at least one week in the proceedings had been planned to allow Fort Hood to mark one year since the shooting and to honor the victims and those soldiers and civilians who exhibited special heroism.
