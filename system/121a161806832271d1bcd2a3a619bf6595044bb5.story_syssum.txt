CNN Heroes salutes the following people who responded to Saturday's shooting at a political event outside a supermarket in Tucson, Arizona -- a shooting that killed six people and wounded 14 others, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords -- with acts of courage.
"One other individual that was there to meet with the congresswoman took one of the chairs that they had been sitting on, folded it, and hit (the gunman) ... right on the shoulders," Badger told CNN's "The Situation Room" on Monday.
When the suspect was on the ground, another person took a gun away from him, Badger said.
He said he ran outside and saw people wrestling with the suspect.
Maisch, 61, is credited with taking an ammunition clip from the suspect after he was wrestled to the ground.
"I was able to kneel up and was able to take the magazine ... before he did," Maisch said.
Hernandez, who trained as a certified nursing assistant, lifted her head to make it easier for her to breathe.
"She was obviously in a lot of pain, so I let her know to squeeze my hand as hard as she needed to."
Jan Brewer acknowledged Hernandez in a speech before state lawmakers on Monday, saying he "showed no fear in the face of gunfire."
Rayle said he was at the event to meet Giffords at the urging of a friend.
... To be honest I froze for just a second, not quite understanding what was going on.
"(For) those who had actually stopped breathing or had no pulse, CPR was initiated."
