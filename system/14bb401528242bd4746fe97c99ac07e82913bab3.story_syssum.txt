(CNN) -- Police recently seized a cab owned by Jesse Matthew, the last person seen with missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham and who also has been linked to another college student's death in 2009, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN.
Police have spoken to several cab drivers who worked with Matthew then, the source with knowledge of the investigation said.
Almost from the start, speculation was raised about the possibility of a connection between Graham's disappearance and Harrington's death.
CNN's Jean Casarez, Athena Jones and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.
