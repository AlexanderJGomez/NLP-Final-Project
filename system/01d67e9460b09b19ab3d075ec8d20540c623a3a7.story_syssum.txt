You are only just hearing about this travesty thanks to a civil suit filed recently by Richards' ex-wife, Tracy Richards, alleging that he also sexually abused his 19-month-old son during the same period.
In 2008, Richards was indicted on two counts of second-degree child rape for sexually penetrating his daughter repeatedly from 2005 to 2007.
Translation for the rest of the world: The rich rapist will "fare well" living as a free man in a house where he raped his own daughter.
The purpose of prison is twofold -- to keep criminals segregated from their victims and the rest of society, to punish them by denying them the freedoms that law-abiding citizens enjoy and to rehabilitate them.
In the meantime, we have a duty to keep rapists like Richards contained in a location where they have no contact or opportunity to hurt another child for a good long time -- and that place is in jail.
The sentence was outrageous, but blaming the judge is too easy.
She filed a suit last month seeking compensatory and punitive damages on behalf of her children.
The girl then recounted the abuse to her pediatrician and New Castle County police, who arrested him.
This is the firm that won victims $77.4 million in a settlement with the Catholic Diocese of Wilmington over sex abuse by a priest.
