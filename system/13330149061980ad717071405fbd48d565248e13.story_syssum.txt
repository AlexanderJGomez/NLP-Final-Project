New York (CNN) -- The New York City Council has joined governments of at least five other major U.S. cities and one state in passing legislation requiring private employers to provide paid sick time.
"People who are sick or who need to care for a loved one should be able to take time off without the fear of losing their job or not having money to pay the bills," City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn said.
In 2006, San Francisco became the first city to required companies to provide paid sick days, according to the National Partnership for Women and Families.
The FMLA was amended in 2008 to permit a "spouse, son, daughter, parent or next of kin" to take up to 26 weeks of leave to care for a member of the Armed Forces who is undergoing medical treatment, according to the Department of Labor website.
