Retired Col. John Leech narrowly escaped death at the Pentagon on September 11, 2001.
Leech could barely contain his sadness recently as he watched a Department of Defense videotape showing the burned interior of the area in the building where he was that fateful morning.
He has avoided touring the building since the attack but finally decided he was ready to "re-engage" with the past.
As he walked the now-renovated halls where he spent the morning of September 11, he recalled the horror of the day.
It rattled you right down to the bone," Leech said.
It was almost like we were in a protective cocoon," Leech recalled.
The married father of a 26-year-old woman remembers snaking his way outside the burning building, where in a stupor he noticed a comb that appeared to belong to a small child.
Seven years after that horrible day, Leech visited the chapel at the new Pentagon Memorial, a two-acre park, which opens to the public Thursday.
"I've avoided ... anything to do with 9/11, so it feels good to be here," he said.
A lot of very good people."
