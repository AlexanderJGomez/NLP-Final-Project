In the interview, Dickinson claims Cosby assaulted her in 1982 after the two had dinner in Lake Tahoe.
Cosby attorney Martin Singer called Dickinson's story "a lie" and said it contradicts her own autobiography and a 2002 interview she did with the New York Observer.
In its wake, one of his accusers, Barbara Bowman, turned to the public once more with an article in The Washington Post and interviews with CNN.
Bowman said she knew her body had been touched without her permission.
