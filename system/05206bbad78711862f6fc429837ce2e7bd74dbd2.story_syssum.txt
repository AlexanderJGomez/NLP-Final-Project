In the east and the north of the city, water was at waist-level in some neighborhoods.
But the plan was rejected late in the day in favor of dredging canals and using pumps, the Bangkok Post reported.
"We were hearing disturbing reports of dangerous animals such as snakes and crocodiles appearing in the floodwaters, and every day we see children playing in the water, bathing or wading through it trying to make their way to dry ground," said Annie Bodmer-Roy, spokeswoman for the humanitarian agency Save the Children.
The Bangkok Post reported that government buses had evacuated a number of elderly residents from the northern and eastern suburbs, and would pick up residents of the capital on Saturday and take them out of Bangkok.
Panic buying has led to a shortage of food and bottled water in the capital, residents said.
The U.S. State Department issued a travel alert on Thursday, recommending against all but essential travel to affected areas.
It noted that most tourist destinations, such as Phuket and Chiang Mai, were unaffected.
The government has called the flooding the worst to afflict the nation in half a century and said it might take more than a month before the waters recede from some areas.
