Even as Americans support military action against ISIS, they still want Obama to seek authority from Congress before taking any action.
Obama, who described ISIS as a "serious threat" in an interview on NBC's "Meet the Press," is scheduled to speak to the nation Wednesday to outline his strategy to address the terrorist organization.
So far, Americans are not happy with how Obama has addressed the ISIS situation.
It has now increased to 14% and ranks right behind the economy, 30%, as the most important problem facing the nation.
"Americans are significantly less reluctant to use military force than they were a year ago, and the number who say that terrorism is the country's most important problem has quadrupled, making it second only to the economy on the list of top problems in the public's mind," CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said.
