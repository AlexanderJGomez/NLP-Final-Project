For the month of June, DC's variant covers are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the iconic villain.
After being shot, the character remained in a wheelchair for decades, until DC retconned Barbara's fate in 2011, allowing her to walk again and be Batgirl.
"Regardless if fans like Rafael Albuquerque's homage to Alan Moore's THE KILLING JOKE graphic novel from 25 years ago, or find it inconsistent with the current tonality of the Batgirl books -- threats of violence and harassment are wrong and have no place in comics or society," they said.
For that reason, I have recommended to DC that the variant cover be pulled.
So, we have the creators of the book and the artist himself all agreeing that the cover was inappropriate.
It was just the latest brouhaha involving portrayals of women in comic books and variant covers in particular.
