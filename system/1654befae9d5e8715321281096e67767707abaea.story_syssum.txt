But when it comes down to it, there are only four categories that count as the big fish.
The Alabama Shakes and Hunter Hayes also scored nods here, but the prevailing sentiment is that they're in the "it's just an honor to be nominated" part of the group.
The contenders here had some of the hottest tracks of the past year: Taylor Swift's "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together," the Black Keys' "Lonely Boy," Kelly Clarkson's "Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)," Gotye's "Somebody That I Used to Know," Fun.
are again two acts that we'd like to think are frontrunners, but the dominating prediction is that this is really a race between Gotye and the Black Keys.
It's the biggest honor of the night, and each nominee this year would be a solid choice to win the Grammy.
While White's album was a welcomed surprise to this category, the odds aren't in his favor.
But with Mumford being the safer bet and a fantastic album to boot, all eyes are on them to win.
