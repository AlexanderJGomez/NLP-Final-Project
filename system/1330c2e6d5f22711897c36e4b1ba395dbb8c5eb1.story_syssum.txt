Dozens of passengers slept at the airport Wednesday night, with some waiting nearly 12 hours before their aircraft were cleared for takeoff.
Spirit Flight 165 was heading for Atlanta when the failure occurred, but returned safely to the Dallas airport.
They waited nearly 12 hours to depart on a flight scheduled to take off Wednesday night at 8:15 p.m.
"Following the engine failure on one of our aircraft last week, and after reviewing routine maintenance procedures, we are completing a proactive and voluntary check on our aircraft engines overnight as a precautionary measure," wrote Spirit spokeswoman Misty Pinson, in an e-mail to CNN.
We are working diligently to get our customers where they need to go as quickly as possible.
... As always, the safety of our customers is our number one priority."
