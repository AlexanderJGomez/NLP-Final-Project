On Christmas Day last year, Alan Henning was sitting in a brightly lit cafe in southern Turkey, sharing a laugh with his friends before they set off on their journey.
While part of the aid convoy stopped at the Turkish border, Henning was part of a much smaller group that volunteered to press ahead into Syria itself.
As the clock ticks down, those who made the trip with him are pleading with the leaders of the militant group -- which has declared an independent Islamic state across parts of Syria and Iraq -- to let Henning go.
Field also had a direct message for the black-clad ISIS executioner known as "Jihadi John" -- the man with the London accent who featured in the group's gruesome videos of the beheadings of Western hostages James Foley, Steven Sotloff, and David Haines.
Those who travelled with Henning to Syria have steered clear of tough talk, adopting a softer tone in addressing the jihadists holding their friend.
Hanif Qadir -- director of the anti-extremism charity Active Change Foundation in east London -- and local youngsters have added their voices to the anti-ISIS drive.
