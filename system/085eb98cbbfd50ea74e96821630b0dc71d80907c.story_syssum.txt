Naturally, of course, I was present, showing up casually late because it's what awesome people do at epic parties.
Granted, this particular epic party was held on Twitter.
OK, so maybe it's not Ibiza, but there was a popular online party hosted by the CVS Beauty Club to promote the pharmacy's cosmetic offerings via social media.
Not surprisingly, however, a random dude eventually entered the conversation and was instantly confused.
Except there's no guacamole, and if you happen to do a keg stand, it's not because everybody else was doing one.
And now I have to fold the laundry ... and do other stuff because I'm home alone with my computer ... drinking ... from a keg.
Personally speaking, the most appealing aspect of a digital Twitter party is that I only have 140 characters to completely embarrass myself.
Essentially, anyone can join for free to get periodic discounts and rewards on various CVS cosmetics.
The online information wasn't exactly clear, though, as to whether Beano qualifies.
Look, I know I didn't offer the American University chapter of Delta Chi anything in terms of social status, and I'm pretty sure I lowered their overall combined GPA by at least a full point, but I was more than willing to pay the yearly fees.
But for those of us who don't use cosmetics or, at the very least, aren't planning on going to the Gathering of the Juggalos, there's probably no real need to apply.
Unless, of course, you really just want to experiment with ointments and colors and masks.
