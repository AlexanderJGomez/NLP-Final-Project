But with the mountaineers' lofty dreams come a price: a trail of trash that now threatens the peak's environment.
Everest 8848 Art Project I" created last year, they have collected 1.5 tons of garbage brought down by climbers from the mountain, including remains of a helicopter that had crashed into the slopes during the 1970s.
We hope our creations will help inspire actions against pollution at the Everest," Nara Bahadur BK, another artist, said.
In last two years, the association has collected over 10 tons of garbage from the Everest, but it estimates that another 10 tons are still littering the slopes.
According to the association, biodegradable garbage is separated from the collection and turned into compost at Namche Bazaar, the major stop point before the base camp.
"We hope our creative works of art will inspire and encourage people to keep the mountains clean," Shahi said.
