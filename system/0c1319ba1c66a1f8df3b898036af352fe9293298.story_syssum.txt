A second incident would be punished by a lifetime ban from the league, Goodell said in a letter and memo to the owners of the league's 32 teams.
Goodell said the circumstances that would warrant a longer suspension include incidents that predate a person's time with an NFL team or acts that involve choking, repeated blows or a weapon.
As we do in all disciplinary matters, if we believe that players' due process rights are infringed upon during the course of discipline, we will assert and defend our members' rights," the NFL Players Association said in its statement.
The punishments, both from the NFL and from the criminal justice system, were widely decried as too light, and the issue quickly spiraled into debates over domestic violence and victim-blaming.
The NFL regular season is 16 games.
