However, Kaymer's decision to enter the Andalucia Valderrama Masters in Spain at the end of this month means the 25-year-old could yet be the one to take over from the off-form Woods.
The win came less than a week after Kaymer was part of the victorious European Ryder Cup team who beat America at Celtic Manor in Wales, where he played with Westwood.
It is expected the 37-year-old will return for the season-ending championship in Dubai which starts on November 25.
The only way Woods can retain his five-year long stint as world number one is to play another tournament in October, but he is not due to return to action until the HSBC Champions event in China on November 4 -- where Westwood was also scheduled to appear.
