I had been surprised to learn, in the spring of 1991, that as the seventh President of Ireland I would become the first to visit Britain as president.
This was one illustration of the fact that relations between the two countries were not normal because of the disputed claims at the time by Britain and Ireland over Northern Ireland.
In 1995 I joined the Queen for an event in St. James Palace, London, commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Queen's Colleges which had been established in Belfast, Cork and Galway (although only Belfast retains that name and original structure).
I remember hosting a lunch in my official residence in 1995 for Senator George Mitchell, who had been asked by U.S. President Bill Clinton to help organize an economic conference in Belfast, so that those still fighting in the streets there might begin to think of a future peace dividend.
When I can, I will be glued to a television set, hoping to see coverage of a state visit that will evoke many memories and bring about the full normalization of the relations between two close and historic neighbors.
