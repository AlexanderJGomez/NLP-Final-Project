The rebels contend that the peacekeepers entered a Syrian village near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, an area where peacekeepers should not be and where intense fighting has been raging for days between rebels and government forces.
"We demand from America, U.N. and the Security Council to intervene and get al-Assad forces to withdraw, then we will release these detainees," the rebels say.
"The apprehension and illegal detention of the Filipino peacekeepers are gross violations of international law," Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario said in a statement.
The rebels posted on Facebook a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the leaders of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the League of Arab States.
Violence continued to plague the country this week, as Syria marked the second anniversary of the war.
Also on Wednesday, a massive explosion ripped through the city of Raqqa, two days after rebels claim to have captured this provincial capital.
In the video, two middle-age men lay bleeding in the street next to scattered oranges and tomatoes that they appeared to have been carrying.
"While we were there, there were two MiG fighter jets running above us that were throwing down missiles," said Ibrahim Olabi, an activist with the Aleppo Media Center, after he visited Raqqa on Tuesday.
