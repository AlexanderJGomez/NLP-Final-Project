He died Saturday in New Orleans at a golf tournament to raise money for his Kidd's Kids Charity, his management company said.
"We sponsored a big dance for the seniors but didn't have enough money to hire a DJ.
The name "Kidd" wouldn't come for several years though.
His career really took off after he moved to Dallas when his morning drive time show went into syndication.
Saturday's golf tournament was for his non-profit Kidd's Kids Charity, which raises money annually to send children with chronic and terminal illnesses -- and their families -- to spend five days at Walt Disney World.
I've listened to the show for years," commented Johnny MacNary.
My thoughts are with his family, friends and colleagues tonight.
