Washington (CNN) -- Ten years after the September 11th attacks, the nation still isn't fully prepared to handle another huge disaster, Lee Hamilton, one of the co-chairmen of the 9/11 Commission, said Thursday.
Tom Ridge, the first secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said competing measures to deal with the problem are being considered by the House and Senate, while police and fire departments are waiting for some kind of action.
The committee's chairman, Rep Peter King, R-New York, said he continues to believe the answer is to set aside a block of wireless telecommunication bands for an emergency communications network.
Hamilton also said the Transportation Security Administration and other entities have done a great deal of work on technology to detect all types of explosives but "we have to accelerate our efforts" to be able to find bomb materials people carry or could hide inside their bodies.
