(CNN) -- Coinciding with this season's flu outbreak is an upsurge of another illness that can be dangerous, even deadly, especially for infants: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
RSV, which generally circulates from late fall into the early spring, is out there with a myriad of other stuff floating around right now: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), adenovirus and parainfluenza, all common respiratory viruses, and pertussis, the bacterial disease that causes whooping cough.
"Just in general, when we look at cough and respiratory symptoms, there's a lot of overlap," said Dr. Susan Gerber, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
At the three pediatric hospitals that make up Children's Heathcare of Atlanta, some 545 youngsters have been treated for RSV since the beginning of December, according to the group's clinical microbiologist, Dr. Robert Jerris.
RSV spreads much like the flu -- exposure from others who are coughing or sneezing and by direct skin-to-skin contact.
Parents should take the same precautions for all respiratory illnesses: wash hands, limit contact with others who are sick, don't smoke and keep surfaces clean.
For babies at highest risk -- those born prematurely, with congenital heart or lung disease -- there is one medication to help ward it off: Doctors may administer a series of injections (Palivizumab) as a protective measure.
"There are multiple candidates for a vaccine in development."
