(CNN) -- Los Angeles police have launched an internal investigation to determine who leaked a picture that appears to show a bruised and battered Rihanna.
"The unauthorized release of a domestic violence photograph immediately generated an internal investigation," an L.A. police spokesman said in a statement.
Detective Deshon Andrews said he had kept the case file closely guarded and that no copies had been made of the original photos and documents.
"I am seeking the counseling of my pastor, my mother and other loved ones and I am committed, with God's help, to emerging a better person."
