The blogger was a "major source of information for the outside world" when the military junta used force last year to suppress anti-government demonstrations, said The Irrawaddy, an online newspaper published by exiles from Myanmar, which is also known as Burma.
Irrawaddy said the members were each sentenced to 65 years in jail, but CNN could not independently confirm the figure.
Members of the group took part in the anti-government demonstrations that ended with the death of as many as 100 people last year after security forces clashed with thousands of protesters.
The action was informally dubbed the "Saffron Revolution" because of the maroon robes with saffron sashes that the monks wore.
