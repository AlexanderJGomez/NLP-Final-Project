"Some evidence that we have collected at a couple of the scenes and some other information we have leads us to believe that this particular matter was ISIS-inspired," said Neil Gaughan, acting deputy commissioner of the Australian Federal Police.
The suspects planned to attack during a major national commemoration in a week, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Saturday.
He instead referred to the group as the "Daesh death cult," employing the acronym that is transliterated from the group's name in Arabic.
"I think the entire Australian community should be concerned about the young age of those particular men," Gaughan said.
"There are now about a hundred Australians who are fighting with terrorists in the Middle East," and another 150 people in Australia support them with funds and recruiting, the Prime Minister said.
In February, Abbott announced tougher citizenship laws as a part of the government's new counterterrorism strategy.
Police said this particular threat had been fully contained.
