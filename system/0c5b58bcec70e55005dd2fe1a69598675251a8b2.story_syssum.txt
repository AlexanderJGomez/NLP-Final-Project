I don't know why the girl had me say those things," he told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an exclusive interview set to air on Monday.

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has asked the other 29 owners to force Sterling, the longest-tenured owner in the league, to sell the Clippers.
And I'm here with you today to apologize and to ask for forgiveness for all the people that I've hurt."
Sterling said he doesn't want his comments to eclipse his lengthy tenure with the NBA.
Last week, another audio recording surfaced online, allegedly showing Sterling trying to add context to the racist comments that got him banned from the league.
In that recording, Sterling purportedly explained that his comments were driven by jealousy.
"There's been a number of occasions where Mr. Sterling and I had conversations just like this one," she said.
There's a number of other hours that the world doesn't know."
Referring to Johnson, Sterling purportedly said on the recording: "Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me.
As criticism over the recording spread, Johnson was among the first to say that Sterling should be forced to sell the team.
Has he done everything he can do to help minorities?
But I don't think he's a good example for the children of Los Angeles."
However, an attorney for Donald Sterling's estranged wife, Shelly, told CNN Friday that she wants to keep her 50% stake in the team.
"She only wants to own the team in her lifetime.
"To be honest with you, I'm wondering if a wife of one of the owners, and there's 30 owners, did something like that, said those racial slurs, would they oust the husband?
"These are the rules to which all NBA owners agreed to as a condition of owning their team."
