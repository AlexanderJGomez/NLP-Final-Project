This time it's Oscar Pistorius whose life has moved from sports headlines to the news pages to cause headaches at Nike headquarters.
Robbie Vorhaus, founder of Vorhaus & Company, which advises companies on maintaining their reputations, said there was a deep conversation taking place in marketing about how to avoid such advertising ricochets with forward thinking and less clichÃ©.
He added that there would be clauses in the Pistorius-Nike contract that make clear when the athlete's behavior can allow the company to cut its ties -- and law-breaking would often be among the reasons.
On Sunday, Pistorius' management company announced that Pistorius had pulled out of five contracted race meets, but that his sponsors were standing by him.
They have said they are happy to let the legal process takes its course before making any change in their position," said his agent Peet Van Zyl in a statement.
Marketing specialist Adam Handt said Nike should do something immediately such as suspending its relationship with Pistorius because of the severity of the accusations against him.
In this marketing world, Vorhaus said, with many athletes sponsored by and representing Nike, it is also easier to shake off the bad publicity when a star falls.
