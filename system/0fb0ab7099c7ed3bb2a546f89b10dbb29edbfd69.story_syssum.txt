Nikolsky hesitates when recalling the moment he realized armed bandits were fast approaching his ship off the coast of Somalia.
As the first mate of the MV Faina, Nikolsky was in charge of 21 crewmen and cargo aboard the Ukrainian operated freight vessel transporting aging Soviet military equipment to the port of Mombasa, Kenya, via the Gulf of Aden.
The discovery of the military cargo signaled the beginning of a four month standoff between the pirates and a host of parties with an interest in reclaiming the ship, including NATO, the U.S. Navy and the Kenyan government.
At the time of the attack, the ship's captain, Vladimir Kolobkov, had taken seriously ill, tragically passing away a week later.
As the days and weeks passed, Nikolsky began to talk to the leader of the pirates, eventually gaining his trust.
At one stage, when it looked as though a ransom would not be achieved, the pirates intimated they would transfer the crew to Somalia in order to obtain a separate ransom for each individual.
"I asked the commander of the navy (who boarded the Faina shortly after the pirates disembarked) to check everything.
That decision has led Nikolsky to St. Petersburg where he navigates vessels 10 times the size of his own into and out of the city's harbor.
"But I spent at sea all of my life, 45 years ... (and) now I like my village, I like my job here."
