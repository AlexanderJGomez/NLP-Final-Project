On the face of it, a simple act, but for four-year old Hannah Mohn this is a milestone.
Jennifer explains: "When we saw my pediatrician ... for one of her first visits, she said even if her legs don't work well enough for her to walk, the biggest thing that we need to work on is making sure that her hands and arms are working to the fullest extent, because if she has use of her hands and arms, she will be able to care for herself.
She began using a device the hospital designed, called the "WREX" -- robotic arms made from 3-D printing.
"We can print a full set of plastic parts for one pair of WREXs for one patient overnight, and by the end of the next work day we can clean the parts and have the WREX fully assembled," says Sample, adding that metal components must also be made by traditional methods prior to assembly.
"It's really nice to have that recognition when the families come back and say 'Hey, this has been wonderful for us,'" he says.
"The next step, we think, is when we could put small motors in these joints that the child would control with either a twitch of the muscle or perhaps a laser.
It definitely teaches her about things with different textures and colors, shapes and where things go and how things work."
"Up to this point there hasn't been much that she has let stop her.
