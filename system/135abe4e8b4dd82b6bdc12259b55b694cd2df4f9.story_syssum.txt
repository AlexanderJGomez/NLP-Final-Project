That night, she was sworn in as sheriff at the county courthouse, meaning that she'll serve at least through the remainder of her late husband's term, with an election set for 2014.
"(She) is the best person to fulfill" her husband's commitment as sheriff, including taking steps to curb drug abuse in the county, county Commissioner Greg "Hootie" Smith said.
A man had walked up to the sheriff's driver's-side door from behind, fired at Crum's head, then returned to his own vehicle and drove away, Rockel told reporters Thursday.
"We're still trying to make sense of it," Baylous said of Maynard's comments.
"We are unsure at this point," Rockel said, why the sheriff was killed.
Weeping and shaking, his mother, Olgie Maynard, confirmed as much, saying her son was institutionalized for about a week three to four years ago.
On Thursday afternoon, he was recovering in a hospital bed.
"Those charges are pending on him getting out of the hospital," Rockel said.
"The flame that Sheriff Crum sparked cannot be extinguished," Mingo County Prosecuting Attorney C. Michael Sparks said in a statement read at Thursday's press conference in Williamson.
Asked whether officials thought there was any connection between Crum's slaying and the recent killing of a Colorado prison official or the slayings of two Texas prosecutors, Hatfield said, "I hope not," but declined to elaborate.
