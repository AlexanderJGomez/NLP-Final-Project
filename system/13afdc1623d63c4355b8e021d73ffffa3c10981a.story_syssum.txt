(CNN) -- The mother of a 25-year-old woman killed in a Boston hotel more than a week ago said Friday that she will remain haunted by her daughter's death for the rest of her life.
Philip Markoff, 23, a second-year student at Boston University's School of Medicine, is charged with killing Brisman on April 14 at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel.
One of the bullets passed through her heart, killing her, prosecutors said.
Markoff is also charged in connection with the April 10 robbery of Trisha Leffler, 29, at a Westin Hotel in Boston.
"Unfortunately, you were given wrong information as was the public," she wrote.
In executing a search warrant at Markoff's home, police found a firearm, along with restraints and duct tape, he said.
He said the incident "may be related to similar crimes occurring in the Boston area" but that had not been determined.
