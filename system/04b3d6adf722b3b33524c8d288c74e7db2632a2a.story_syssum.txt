(CNN) -- Even when Chelsea held a nine-point lead over Manchester City atop English football's Premier League, Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho always maintained his team wasn't the favorite.
Manchester City, fresh off a convincing victory in the Manchester derby, took a deserved lead in London in the 18th minute when David Silva was the quickest to react after Edin Dzeko's left-footed shot struck the post.
Although Chelsea tallied more than 20 shots, only two were on goal and none managed to beat keeper Julian Speroni.
Manchester United has struggled in its first season under David Moyes but there were boos when a banner flew above Old Trafford calling for the Scot's departure.
Elsewhere, English trio Rickie Lambert, Jay Rodriguez and Adam Lallana shone for Southampton again in a 4-0 home win against Newcastle; and relegation contenders West Bromwich Albion and Cardiff City played to a 3-3 draw after both scored deep in injury time.
