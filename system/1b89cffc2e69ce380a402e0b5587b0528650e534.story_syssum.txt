A line began to form at the Apple Store here on the eve of the iPhone 4S release, as is often the case around the world during the company's product launches.
Seconds later, an enthusiastic man in a yellow polo shirt positioned his two kids near the computer legend and pleaded for him to pose.
Flowers, partially eaten apples and notes were laid in front of Apple Stores around the world, including this one, where the memorial was set just a few feet from Wozniak's spot in line.
He has said previously that he does not ask colleagues about products in development because he does not want to ruin the surprise for himself.
Over the past year, he has not been shy about his anticipation for voice-assist technology, like the new 4S tool called Siri.
Wozniak arrived about noon, and he plans to stay overnight in order to get the new iPhone first, he said.
"He does it because he wants to, not for publicity reasons."
Wozniak said he had already ordered two iPhones to be delivered to his home; he's in line to buy one for his wife.
"I came out here just so I can hang out with Woz for 18 hours," said Gandy, who lives in the nearby city of Campbell.
" said one fan, who had her picture taken with Wozniak.
He spends a great deal of time responding to fan mail.
