"Though much still needs to be done, this settlement is an important step towards curbing the impact of abusive stop and frisk practices," said Christopher Dunn, associate legal director of the NYCLU and lead plaintiffs' counsel in the case.
"It is a relief to know that my personal information will be cleared from the stop-and-frisk database," said Lino.
The NYPD database will only erase records of those who were cleared of any wrongdoing, but will continue to maintain details of all other aspects of police stops.
The lawsuit claims that police officers routinely stop minority men, particularly black and Latino men, without legal reasons.
