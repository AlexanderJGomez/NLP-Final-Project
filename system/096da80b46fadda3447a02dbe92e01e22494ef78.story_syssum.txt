Don drove us first to an out of the way small side street, where there were tiny KTVs operating out in the open like cheap brothels.
I become less nervous as we walk to the back where an overweight young woman frantically sweeps the kitchen floor, and we are pointed up some cement and metal stairs.
I am overwhelmed with the saturated smell of air freshener that apparently has gone off like an insect fogger in this room -- to cover what odor, who knows.
Don says if we take the elevator up from the basement, we can skip the bar and go straight to the "massage" floor.
The girl crowds us and accuses me; more people start to gather.
They were acting like they had far too much to lose.
The large and comfortable room had a giant screen on one wall and couches lining the other three walls.
Don picks one, and so does Scott and the two join us; the karaoke starts in earnest.
I must sing with gusto to justify my presence, otherwise what is this white lady doing here?
She chooses to sing a song from the Karaoke catalog, a popular dance hit in Khmer, which has a video of a singer performing in front of what looks to be an American style high school dance, again like a prom.
and it talks about how a girl is like a flower, and only has the one time where she has most value.
Thankfully, the hostesses did not seem to mind or care that we were doing this; the whole room was on security cameras poised in the corners but no one came in and stopped us.
She didn't give her number, but we told her it was okay, Don's outreach person would call her friend and we gave her Don's card.
I had no idea that I was going to be involved in trying to recruit girls to leave the KTV life and receive the services of Don's NGO.
