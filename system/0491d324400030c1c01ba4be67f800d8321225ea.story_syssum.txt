Moscow (CNN) -- The death toll in a Moscow metro derailment Tuesday has reached 22, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency said.
Dozens of ambulances arrived at the scene, along with three helicopters, to help shuttle the injured to hospitals, ITAR-Tass said.
In the moments afterward, many of those caught up in the derailment scrambled back up to the surface at the station west of central Moscow, some bleeding and dazed as they emerged.
