"We're pleased with how it's going," Wells said, but cautioned that the operation, which began Saturday with the removal of the old cap, is only in its second day.
If successful, the effects of the containment cap operation could halt the oil gusher that started April 20 after a deadly explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico.
"As we start to ramp up the additional containment capacity, we should see less and less flow," Wells said.
It said another recovery vessel, the Q4000, "should continue to capture and flare oil and gas."
Wells also said there will be "significant measurement capability" added to the new cap so officials can get a good idea of the flow rate.
