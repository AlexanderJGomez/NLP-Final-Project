In the hours leading up to midafternoon, crews conduct three positive pressure tests, in which fluid weight is placed on the seal.
One draws 15 barrels of liquid out of the well instead of the expected five, raising more concerns about leaks.
In a second, pressure on the rig's "kill line" -- a high-pressure pipe used to cut off the flow of oil -- falls to zero, while rising to 1,400 pounds per square inch in the drill line, indicating a buildup of natural gas.
More fluid is reported flowing out of the well than is being pumped in.
The supply ship Damon B. Bankston, which is tied up alongside Deepwater Horizon, reports drilling fluid spilling onto its deck and is told to move back 500 meters from the rig.
Eleven of the 126 on board are lost at sea when the platform sinks two days later.
