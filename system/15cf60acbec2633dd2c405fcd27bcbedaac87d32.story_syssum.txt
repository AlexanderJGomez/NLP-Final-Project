When Kreshnik Berisha, the first suspected member of ISIS to stand trial in Germany, was arrested upon his arrival back in Frankfurt in December after spending six months in Syria, youth team football coach Meyer was left shell-shocked.
"He was a normal player, never shouting too much and was fighting on the field with his friends.
In a written statement read out by his lawyer during the court case, Berisha explained his motivation for traveling to Syria via Turkey in July 2013.
In his statement, Berisha told the court how he was hoping to lead a normal life after serving out his sentence.
"His old teammates were very shocked -- they didn't know how to react," Meyer said.
"They asked whether we should go back to just looking after our own but I said we cannot do that because of one person.
