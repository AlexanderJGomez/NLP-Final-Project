"What she's doing is putting a personal and human face on the issue ... there's nothing more crucial," said Washington Post columnist Sally Quinn.
"I think if you can humanize it and personalize it, it suddenly brings it home to people -- especially those who are screaming and yelling about the government taking over," Quinn said.
Mrs. Obama not only faced the issue as a mother, but also as a daughter.
He was able to get up and go to work every day, even though it got harder for him as he got sicker and more debilitated.
Quinn says that personal story is critical in the health care debate -- something that has been lacking in the president's message so far, which has often been deemed by pundits as too policy-oriented and too surgical in nature.
"She can help in this health care debate by not getting involved in the minutiae of the bills, but essentially emphasizing the reason we need health care reform.
But a first lady's involvement in health care reform is nothing new.
In the early '90s, first lady Hillary Clinton spearheaded the Clinton administration's push for reform, holding meetings, testifying before congressional committees and, in general, taking charge of the issue.
She said the president, not Michelle Obama, was the was the one who pushed health care reform in his early domestic agenda.
Borger said that the first lady is playing a completely different role.
