Ten members of the country's youth judo team were aboard the Caspian Airlines plane, said several sources, including Iran's Press TV.
The plane "disintegrated into pieces," said Col. Masood Jafari Nasab, security commander of Qazvin, the city nearest to the crash site in northwestern Iran.
The three most recent crashes -- in which a total of 548 people died -- involved different planes, flown by different airlines, in different stages of flight, he said.
Qazvin Police Chief Hossein Behzadpour and Mohammad Reza Montazer Khorasan, the head of the disaster management center in Iran's health ministry, both confirmed that all 168 people on board died, Press TV reported.
But he added that there could be large debris not seen on television, and that could change his analysis.
They will work alongside Iranian aviation authorities, the agency said.
The Tupolev 154 is essentially banned in the West because it does not comply with European noise and pollution regulations, but it has a safer-than-average accident record, Wiley said.
The plane crashed 16 minutes after takeoff, said the newspaper, quoting a spokesman from Iran's civil aviation organization.
The last crash in Iran involving a Tupolev plane occurred in 2006, according to the Web site airdisaster.com.
Twenty-nine of the 147 people on board died in that crash.
