Will and Jada Pinkett Smith's 11-year-old daughter, Willow, was recently given a tongue-lashing on social media after posting a picture of herself sporting a tongue piercing on Instagram.
Though she later revealed that it was in fact a fake, magnetic tongue ring, people were already whipping their opinions back and forth about whether young people are too vulnerable to make permanent (or potentially scarring) decisions about their bodies.
Most states allow tattoos and body piercings for children under the age of majority, which is 18 years old in most of the United States, with parental consent.
Child development experts contacted by CNN agree with this age of majority for permanent body modification in young adults, but also assert age is but a number; maturity level is a much better parameter to go by.
"The aesthetic commitment they require probably extends too far into a young person's future -- how will they know they will be the sort of person to like it when they are 30, 40 or 50?
John A. Haynes, however, says those reminders are exactly why he doesn't regret his decision to get his first tattoo at age 17.
In some Spanish and Latino cultures, it's customary to pierce a baby girl's ears shortly after they're born.
Dr. Timothy M. Jochen, of Contour Dermatology & Cosmetic Surgery Center in Southern California, says he sees tattoo removal patients as early as their twenties now.
Cassandra Martins got her first -- and only -- tattoo when she was 15 with her mother's consent, and already began to regret it a few years later when she entered college.
"It is important for young people to develop what is on the inside and then what other people see will not matter as much," says Bober.
Would you let your child get a body piercing or tattoo if they were not yet 18?
