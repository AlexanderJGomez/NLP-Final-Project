Over the short course of a 12-song set backed by his all-male band, White stuck mostly to his new material with high-energy takes on "Sixteen Saltines" and "Hypocritical Kiss," plus four White Stripes songs; he sprinted to the piano for a new version of "Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground" and strapped on his Telecaster for an epic "Ball and Biscuit."
At one point, he also suggested performing the rest of the show acoustically, which he joked only ten percent of fans would want.
According to the New York Observer, the ushers at the concert seemed equally mystified by its early ending, and a member of the security team later offered an explanation to the reporter.
The paper also noted that White had several "angry exchanges" with a shirtless fan in the front row who was removed by security.
