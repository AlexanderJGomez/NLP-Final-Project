Scotia, New York (CNN) -- Christina Powell folds the red, white and blue quilt before it is packed up and sent to Andrews Air Force Base, some 400 miles away in Maryland.
"Several years ago," says Powell, "I heard at our quilting guild meeting that somebody wanted to organize this and get it started in our area, and I thought 'I can do that.'
"I've probably made 20 to 30 bed quilts, more than 100 baby quilts for another charity event, and innumerable amounts of wall hangings that I make and give away," she says.
Pat Baker is the project's chairwoman, and the quilts are delivered directly to her front door in Hughesville, Maryland.
In her bedroom hallway, several large bags are stuffed full of more than 70 quilts and blankets to be brought to Andrews Air Force Base and handed to the soldiers as they arrive back in the United States.
A letter is attached to each quilt telling soldiers about the project and thanking them for their service, Baker says.
"When I was passing through all the hospitals and medical centers on my way home, I noticed all these quilts on pretty much all of the hospital beds," Winker says.
On the back edge of Winker's quilt is a patch sewn in by Powell that reads: "Thank you for your service to our country.
