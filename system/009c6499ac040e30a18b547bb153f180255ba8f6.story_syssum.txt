It wasn't as bad as Yolanda," he said, referring to Typhoon Haiyan, which completely destroyed his house in the Magallanes "barangay," or district, of Tacloban a year ago.
Pointing at the missing part of his ceiling above his living area and kitchen, he added: "It was not nailed down as well as the other area of roof."
According to the mayor and the city's disaster management authorities, there have so far been no casualties and power should be restored in the next day or so.
Hagupit spared it this time around -- the only clues to what took place the night before were lots of tree branches and roots strewn around the surrounding streets.
She and her family are among hundreds who have spent the last few days camped out at the local Roman Catholic "Redemption" church.
As a result, she spent more than 20 days at the Redemption, lying between pews with her children.
"We need help from the government --  financial assistance, materials, so we can rebuild," she said.
The atmosphere inside the main chapel at the Redemption was far calmer than a day earlier when everyone nervously awaited the arrival of Hagupit -- these were among the town's poorest and most vulnerable.
Yet she and her family still don't have a house, more than a year after Haiyan.
"I don't know where we'll go this time," she said.
