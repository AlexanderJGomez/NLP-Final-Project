"When God Almighty orders us to destroy these statues, idols and antiquities, we must do it, even if they're worth billions of dollars," he says.
Qais Hussain Rashid, director general of Iraqi museums at the Ministry of Antiquities and Tourism, said Friday on Iraqiya TV that most of the artifacts shown in the ISIS video were real -- including a famed, millennia-old winged bull that's seen being defaced with a drill.
"On repeated viewing of that very grainy video, we now suspect that there (were) far more originals in the museum than I first thought," said Eleanor Robson, chairwoman of the British Institute for the Study of Iraq.
ISIS' system of profiteering from antiquities thieving is very complicated, the three said, adding that for some areas along the Euphrates River, ISIS leaders encourage semiprofessional field crews to dig.
