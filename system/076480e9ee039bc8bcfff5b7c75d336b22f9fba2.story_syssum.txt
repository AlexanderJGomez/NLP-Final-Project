Westminster, Colorado (CNN) -- It seems like a simple question, but ask Victor Perez and Dulce Garcia what grade they're in and you won't get a traditional answer.
The move to do away with grade levels throughout the Adams County School District began three years ago.
Children work at their own level in each subject and must demonstrate proficiency in various learning targets, achieving a score of 75% or higher before they're allowed to move on to the next level.
Unlike traditional schools, students at Hodgkins can move up a learning level anytime they're ready, not just at the end of the year.
"The time is right for a system that focuses on individual students and lets them progress at their own pace," said education researcher Robert Marzano, who is helping the district develop standards-based learning, a system that was first introduced in the 1960s.
Their response, according to Marshall: "'You mean, by the time they get to us they're going to know all ... of the prior material that they should know in biology, in math, in social studies, and I'm not going to have to spend the first three months of their freshman year figuring out what they don't know?
Instead, older children at lower levels are given extra help, as they are in traditional middle and high schools.
The organization's executive director, Wendy Battino, said that in order for standards-based learning to work, schools must have strong leadership and shared vision.
It's really hard to lead systemic change when you have that much turnover," Battino said.
"So I would say, if within three to five years we're not seeing the kind of results that we project, yeah, it probably could be at risk," she said.
"Our hope and goal is that when this year's test scores come out and the following year's, that progression will just continue to increase," Gould said, adding that test scores don't paint the whole picture.
