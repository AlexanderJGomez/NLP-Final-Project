U.S. President Barack Obama pushed for the release of Abedini and two other detained Americans --  Robert Levinson and Amir Hekmati -- when he spoke on the phone with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in September.
He had converted to Christianity from Islam and became a pastor in Idaho.
Naghmeh Abedini told lawmakers Thursday that when U.S. and Iranian officials met to discuss the nuclear deal, the U.S. had a "perfect" opportunity to ask for the pastor's release.
She said that it was a heartbreaking moment to be without her husband and that as Christmas approaches, she is praying for her husband and praying that her government realizes "how far we've fallen" with negotiating with Iran without pushing more to secure her husband's freedom.
Between 2000 and 2005, her husband had previously gotten into trouble with Iran's government because he was talking about his Christian faith with Iranian Christians in their homes, she said.
It didn't make sense to her, and she finds it outrageous, that her husband would be held now for offenses related to religion.
In her statement, she explained that he was initially held in the notorious Evin Prison in Tehran, where guards and interrogators beat him.
Naghmeh Abedini said her father showed her husband pictures of the couple's two children when he visited him in prison.
"It is so hard and so heart breaking for me to see these pictures and to know that I am not there beside you as you grow," he wrote.
"I think it's the worst torture to see your kids suffering and not being able to do anything," she said.
Bob Levinson, a retired FBI agent, has been kept in the dark about him since he vanished on a business trip to Iran in March 2007.
He finished his service four years later as a decorated combat veteran with tours in Iraq.
