Weinstein told CNN's Piers Morgan on Friday night that he can't in good good conscience advocate against on-screen violence while promoting movies that some claim revel in it.
The co-founder -- with his brother Bob -- of Miramax Films and now the Weinstein Co. spoke days after announcing plans for a movie that will be critical of the National Rifle Association.
Weinstein recalled calls to action to address gun violence in the wake of such mass shootings, only to have that momentum seemingly fade after a few days.
While he has no problems with real-to-life films like "Lone Survivor," the current hit chronicling a team of Navy SEALs in Afghanistan, the producer vowed, "I'm not going to make some crazy action movie just to blow up people and exploit people."
And as much as I want to ignore it, as much as I want to go on with my regular life, I can't shake it this time."
