The vast majority of the camp's occupants are from the town of Sinjar and fled the ISIS assault there back in August.
We're told that women who have just given birth or are breastfeeding are considered impure and cannot be taken as sexual slaves -- but Hanan, 19, was neither of those things.
For the first week, Hanan was held with 50 others, regularly beaten and threatened with torture, and fed just a bowl of rice.
The group was then taken to a three story building in Mosul she described as a sex slave warehouse, where hundreds of girls and women were held.
From that group Hanan was separated into a smaller group of seven and taken into a house in a village.
I crawled to the wall and was about to jump over it and then I saw their flashlight," she tells me.
Now physically free but mentally still captive, Hanan remains tormented -- like so many others, by what she has been through and what those still with ISIS are being forced to endure -- a fate worse than death.
