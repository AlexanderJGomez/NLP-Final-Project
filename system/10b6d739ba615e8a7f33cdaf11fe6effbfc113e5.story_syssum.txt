The ruling vacated a lower court's preliminary injunction and opened the way for Texas to sever money to clinics affiliated with Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider, which has come under recent attack from anti-abortion politicians.
Texas opposed government funding for Planned Parenthood clinics because the organization provides abortions and has been in a long-running battle with the federal government.
Planned Parenthood sued Texas, winning an injunction against the law by arguing that abortion is constitutional and Texas' efforts would block women's access to preventive health care.
"Texas will continue providing important health services for women through this program in spite of the Obama administration's disregard for our state law and unilateral decision to defund this program," he said.
But Texas lawmakers object to Planned Parenthood because the organization is the nation's leading provider of abortions and is a vocal advocate for abortion rights, Gov.
Last year, Texas enacted a law that tried to require a woman seeking an abortion to hear the description of an ultrasound of the fetus, even if she objects.
The law has been challenged in court.
