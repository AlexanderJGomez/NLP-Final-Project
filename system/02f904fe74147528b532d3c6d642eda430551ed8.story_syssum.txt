(CNN) -- Following this week's revelation that J.K. Rowling penned a crime thriller under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith, the "Harry Potter" creator has joined a long line of women who have written novels under a cloak of masculinity.
After a highly successful career as a novelist under her own name, Nora Roberts decided to adopt a more elusive tag for her "...in Death" collection: a canon comprising of 43 published works, with three more set for release later this year.
But it was soon revealed that the brains behind the book were Meg Howrey, an actress and author, and Christina Lynch, a journalist and TV producer.
Explaining their decision to adopt a single fictitious name for themselves, Howrey said: "We had both read a raft of articles talking about how men don't buy books written by women."
"She was incredibly bold for an unmarried woman, but she was determined that they would publish as men in order to get reviews that wouldn't be condescending."
