NEW YORK (CNN) -- A rash of bank robberies in New York has the city's police commissioner worried that criminals have turned banks into "virtual cash machines" and some wondering whether tough economic times are fueling the trend.
It's enough for some to link the trend to the rash of layoffs, the plummeting stock market and the bust in the real estate values, all of which have left many Americans in dire financial straits.
CNN security analyst Mike Brooks agreed, adding that although there are typically many bank robberies during the holidays, there are no data to suggest that any recent spike was caused by the economy.
"I would anticipate that people who rob banks have been involved with crime  before because that's not where one is likely to start," Blumstein said.
In fact, bank robbers have simply handed tellers a note in a vast majority of hold-ups in New York.
Criminals talk to each other, they know what's going on, but typically they are apprehended," Mike Smith said.
