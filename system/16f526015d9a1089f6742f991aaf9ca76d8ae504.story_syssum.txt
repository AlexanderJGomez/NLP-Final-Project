The series of bailouts and austerity measures implemented during the last two years has led to a fundamental political crisis affecting both the function of government and the standing of key politicians and political parties.
Extremism -- both from the far left and from the far right -- is visible throughout the public sphere: it has permeated the political rhetoric; it has polarized social groups against each other; it is present in the everyday discourse of ordinary citizens who single-handedly condemn not only individual politicians but the institutions of representative democracy altogether.
In the minds of many Greeks, police action is associated with the suppression of fundamental civil liberties.
Yet, for the first time in recent memory, the political battle lines in Greece are not drawn between left and right, but between the modernizers and the populists existing in most political parties across the spectrum.
The modernizers support Greece's position within the eurozone at all costs and favor radical reforms, including a smaller and more efficient role for the public sector.
One thing is certain -- the political system in Greece is changing and the repercussions may well be felt across Europe and the world.
In addition to international skepticism, the Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos is facing a power vacuum at the heart of the political system.
