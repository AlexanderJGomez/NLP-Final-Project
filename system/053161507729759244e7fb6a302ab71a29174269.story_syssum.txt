After waking five minutes before he was due to start playing, Furyk made a dash from his hotel to the course but failed to get to the 11th tee of The Barclays tournament in New Jersey in time.
Injury or family emergency are the only reasons that excuse a player's absence, consequently, Furyk will miss Thursday's planned round with countryman Steve Stricker and Ernie Els of South Africa.
Slugger White, the Tour's vice president of rules and competition told the PGA Tour website: "It is unfortunate.
Furyk is due to win his seventh Ryder Cup cap against Europe at Celtic Manor in October.
