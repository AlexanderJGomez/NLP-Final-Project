Paignton Zoo in Devon is grabbing bananas out of its monkeys' hands, giving them leafy veggies and sprouts instead.
The zoo says the high calorie and sugar content of bananas grown for human consumption -- which are sweeter than those found in the wild -- are bad for the monkeys' health and can rot their teeth.
The zoo has not been able to find a supplier for the kind of wild-grown bananas that would be more suitable for the monkeys, he said.
According to the zoo's head of conservation, Amy Plowman, the bananas' high sugar content could cause the monkeys to develop diabetes or similar conditions.
Knowling said there was no obvious sign that the monkeys were missing the fruit.
