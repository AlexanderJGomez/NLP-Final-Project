Mexican authorities accused four top military officials of connections with organized crime in a high-profile case that has renewed debate over the role of government troops in the drug war.
In the halls of Mexico's Congress, this week's indictment of the military officials rekindled discussion over a hallmark of Calderon's strategy: deploying thousands of troops into the streets to patrol hot spots where warring cartels are battling over turf.
The military officials were arrested in May, but Tuesday's indictment marked the first time formal charges were brought against them.
"If proven, the full weight of the law must be applied because they have been federal government officials and are responsible for combating organized crime, and if they are colluding with them the punishment should set an example," legislator Arturo Santana told state-run media.
