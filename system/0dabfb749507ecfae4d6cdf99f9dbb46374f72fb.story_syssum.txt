The reward offer comes as police and federal agents petition neighborhood residents for information in their joint investigation of the three killings and three other attacks on women in the Kensington area of Philadelphia.
The partially clothed body of the latest victim, Casey Mahoney, 27, was discovered December 15, according to police spokeswoman Jillian Russell.
The location, the similar nature of the attacks and the descriptions of the attacker led police to suspect they are connected.
But authorities say they lack corroborating DNA evidence linking the assaults to the homicides because too much time had elapsed between the initial two assaults in October and when the victims notified police.
"This could change if there are any indications that the subject or subjects responsible for the crimes ... are linked to similar crimes elsewhere."
