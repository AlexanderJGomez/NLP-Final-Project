Grammer's verified Twitter account started on June 30 with the tweet, "It has come to my attention that the fine people of @Twitter have an egregious grammar problem.

One person tweeted, "@KelseyGrammer, your hashtag #KelseyGrammerGrammar is the best thing ever (notice my correct use of your, not you're)!"
So watch your p's and q's, people.
