In contrast, observing men on the day they make a conscious choice to exit the gene pool reveals the sex's vulnerability and thoughtfulness.
And yet, even though modern techniques require neither needle nor scalpel, and for the vast majority of men it takes only a few days to recover, it's still a tough sell.
Sadly, while men waffle on the sidelines, more than 300 million women have had tubal ligations -- six times the number of men having vasectomies, even though tubal ligations are more invasive, costly and risky.
With all these reasons, you'd think for men who no longer wish to have children choosing a family planning option that is permanent, safe and secure would be a no-brainer.
Many women would agree with a friend of mine, who once suggested vasectomies change a man's status from alpha male to alpha-lite.
We acknowledge there is a small chance that a vasectomy can cause long lasting pain, and we certainly have great sympathy for these men.
The unfair part is that it's women who take it on almost exclusively for one third of their lives.
Providing vasectomies is not easy or always accepted, but on Friday, there will be approximately 300 skilled doctors from 30 countries participating in what will be the largest male-oriented family planning event in history.
