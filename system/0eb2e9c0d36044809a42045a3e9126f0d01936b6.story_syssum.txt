A candidate, a former Secretary of State, who was campaigning in Massachusetts where she said that 'don't let them tell you that businesses creates jobs,'" Bush said, referring to a line Clinton made last week.
And the only way that we do that is to create a climate of high sustained economic growth where everybody, everybody in this country has a chance at earned success," Bush said.
The former governor isn't the only potential GOP presidential candidate who knocked Clinton this week over the jobs comments.
Paul also used his time at the mic to tie Clinton's comments to a comment from President Barack Obama on the 2012 campaign trail that was used repeatedly by Republicans to attack the president during his reelection bid.
The remark caused the Obama campaign quite a headache in 2012, and it looks like Clinton's comments on jobs could have the same impact in 2016, if she were to run.
