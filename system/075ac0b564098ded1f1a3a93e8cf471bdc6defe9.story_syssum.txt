Ideally a marathon runner should be doing 40 to 50 miles a week for at least three or four months before race day.
I used to dismiss as a myth the notion of the "wall," the pain barrier that marathon runners experience at about 20 miles.
The only real distances under my belt are the three miles that I walk each day from Victoria Station in London up to CNN's bureau in Soho.
But three demanding children and a house restoration project mean the only time I've had to run is late at night.
I hope I feel better for this Sunday's race.
After worrying that I hadn't done nearly enough training for Sunday's Brighton marathon, I finished in a creditable three hours and 35 minutes -- only a couple of minutes slower than last year's time.
I was helped on my way -- as ever during a marathon -- by the thousands of spectators lining the route.
But I managed to keep walking -- always the best strategy, and walked the mile back to my home where I lay on the sofa all afternoon.
I can only conclude that the exercise I take during the rest of the year is sufficient to keep me fit enough to run a marathon.
Sure, 26.2 miles (42 kilometers) is a long way, but as long as you have a decent level of fitness, you'll be able to run a fairly fast marathon.
