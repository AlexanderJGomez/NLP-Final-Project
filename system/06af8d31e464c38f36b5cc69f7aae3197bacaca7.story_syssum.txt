Carlo Ancelotti's team made the perfect start when City striker Emmanuel Adebayor inadvertently put the ball in his own net in the eighth minute after goalkeeper Shay Given's save from a Nicolas Anelka shot hit him in the back and rebounded in.
City lost England defenders Richards and Bridge to injury -- the latter stretchered off after a studs-first lunge by Juliano Bennetti -- before substitute fullback Nedum Onuoha gave Chelsea the chance to level in the 82nd minute when he brought down Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba.
Veteran midfielder Paul Scholes, who has been reportedly pondering his future, lashed home his 99th Premier League goal on the stroke of halftime and then his potential young successor Darren Gibson followed up his midweek double with a similarly impressive strike in the 61st minute.
Spain midfielder Cesc Fabregas missed a penalty on his 250th appearance for the Gunners after Andriy Arshavin was tripped, but the Russia forward -- playing on his own up front in the absence of Theo Walcott, Robin van Persie, Nicklas Bendtner and Eduardo -- scored the opener from a tight angle in the 26th minute.
Birmingham City moved up to eighth place after winning 3-2 at Wigan Athletic, with Alex McLeish's side coming from a goal down to score three in 11 second-half minutes as Sebastian Larsson scored with two free-kicks and Colombia striker Christian Benitez netted the other.
Wigan, who led through a superb strike from Charles N'Zogbia, pulled one back at the end through Jordi Gomez but the defeat left Robert Martinez's frustratingly inconsistent side in 14th place -- four points above the drop zone.
