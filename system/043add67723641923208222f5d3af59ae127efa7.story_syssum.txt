A native of Mexico City, Gomez Bolanos had been living in the resort town for the last few years due to health problems.
Gomez Bolanos' death was confirmed by Televisa, the Mexican media conglomerate where he spent most of a career that spanned more than four decades, mainly on television.
His son Roberto Gomez Fernandez, also a TV producer, said his father had "an extraordinary knowledge of human nature in many respects," which allowed his TV shows to be translated into multiple languages without losing their comedic impact.
Though trained as an engineer, Chespirito never worked as one, choosing instead to write for TV and radio shows and screenplays starting in the mid-1950s.
"While the parents of my friends went to work building houses or to hospitals or attorneys' offices, my dad would dress in all red, wore antennae and went to work," Gomez Fernandez said.
His first message on Twitter on May 28, 2011, was "siganme los buenos," or "follow me, those of you who are good," a phrase that he constantly used on his shows and that many people still use in Mexico and elsewhere.
