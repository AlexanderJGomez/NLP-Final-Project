Saudi Arabia had launched airstrikes on Houthi positions across Yemen, hoping to wipe out the Iranian-allied rebel group that has overthrown the government and seized power.
Former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and his family will leave Yemen and never return for a position in politics, the source said.

Hadi claims he's Yemen's legitimate leader and is working with the Saudis and other allies to return to his country.
