For her, and many decorators who contributed to this week's "inviting bedrooms" Open House assignment, the feel of bedding is important.
A carefully curated collection of down duvets, mattress pads, quilts and blankets of different thicknesses allow for temperature control and comfort, whether you're fast asleep or sniffling through a miserable flu bug -- and that probably won't come from a preselected, oversized bag, decorators said.
"After a lot of trial and error, I've found that we need at least one king-size synthetic pillow and one regular-size down pillow per person."
The calming, white master bedroom she decorated is "the most comfortable place for me in our home," she said.
The "paint by numbers" mountain vacation bedroom Berrey designed embodies her decorating aesthetic.
And according to the logic of most bedroom decorating schemes, designers say the bed and headboard are more important than the rest of the furniture.
"Whether it's a full bed frame or even just a pretty quilt hanging on the wall behind the bed, a headboard makes the room feel more finished."
"We have an Ikea Malm bed, something that was in our price range when we first bought it, but it never really stood out on its own," she said.
"I recently moved the lamps in our bedroom to another room in the house, and we were with only an overhead light for a couple of months," she said.
So, too, can black-out drapes, or even eye masks and white noise machines.
The only thing it seems decorators can't agree on when it comes to bedrooms is whether to put a TV in the room.
Even if they think TVs don't belong in bedrooms, decorators confess to it apologetically.
