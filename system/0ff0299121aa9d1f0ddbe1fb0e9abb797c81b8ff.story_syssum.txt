How does a trend go from new and exciting to old and passe so quickly?
The amount of information in any individual tweet is highly variable, but in aggregate the more than 65 million tweets composed per day represent a detailed, real-time trace of the collective thoughts and feelings of a significant fraction of the population -- potentially offering valuable information to everyone from politicians to advertisers to social researchers.
From a research perspective, Twitter is more than just a new tool; it's an entirely new kind of tool.
In fact, other research groups have also begun to examine Twitter data and have demonstrated that it can be used to predict the box-office success of an upcoming movie.
This is why researchers owe a debt of gratitude to Twitter for its policy of open access to public tweets (exemplified by the recent donation of its entire public tweet history to the Library of Congress).
For example, monitoring the mood of the public chatter on Twitter could allow businesses to quickly identify and respond to incidents, mitigating the effect of negative publicity on their brand.
This new kind of data presents new challenges, such as privacy, anonymity and legality, but developing a science around it has the potential to do enormous good.
