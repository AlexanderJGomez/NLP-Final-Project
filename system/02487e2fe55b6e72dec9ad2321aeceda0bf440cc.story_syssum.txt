(CNN) -- For the second time in six months, Henrique Capriles Radonski will be in an electoral fight for the presidency of Venezuela.
Generous social programs are a foundation of the government that Chavez headed, and Capriles has that he will not do away with them.
The following year, Capriles was elected mayor of Baruta, which is located in the state of Miranda and is a suburb in the Caracas metropolitan area.
He then was re-elected mayor with almost 80% approval in 2004.
Capriles' grandparents were Polish Holocaust survivors, but he is a practicing Catholic, according to the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center.
