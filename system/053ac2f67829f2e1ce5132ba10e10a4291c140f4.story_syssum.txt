But Thursday's show by the band The Swell Season at the Mountain Winery, just outside San Jose, turned tragic when a concertgoer leapt from the roof of the stage, landed near the lead singer and died, in what authorities say was a suicide.
Authorities said Saturday that Pickels had been out of jail on $150,000 bail after threatening to kill his girlfriend and himself on New Year's Day.
The winery, located in Saratoga, did not immediately return a call for comment Saturday night, though it addressed the incident in a brief message on its web site.
"The band, crew and all involved with them are shocked and saddened by the death that occurred at last night's show," the songwriting duo said on its Twitter page Friday.
"We wish to continue to be sensitive to family and friends of this individual and hope that in performing it is not viewed as a selfish act," the message continues.
We continue to have them at the forefront of our minds and hearts.?"
