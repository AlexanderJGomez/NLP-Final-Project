Last week, in the first concessions made by the government, the Prime Minister and Cabinet resigned, a controversial anti-protest law was repealed, and Yanukovych signed off on a contested amnesty bill for anti-government protesters.
Yanukovych has resisted calls for him to step down and defended the government's handling of the political crisis.
Deadly clashes last month were an escalation of weeks of largely peaceful public protests prompted by Yanukovych's decision in November to spurn a planned trade deal with the European Union and favor Russia instead.
Western leaders last week also voiced growing concern about reports of the kidnapping and torture of opposition activists in the country.
Bulatov on Sunday flew to Lithuania for medical treatment, protest leaders said.
