(CNN) -- The Obama administration may very well be right that the attack in Benghazi which claimed the lives of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other U.S. officials was part of a pre-planned terrorist operation.
They will want the world to think that their actions represent a popular Libyan and wider Muslim reaction; thus, reversing the perception of jihadists being outcasts from their own societies.
This attack was committed by a small group of extremists who do not represent the Libyan population.
That Libyans did not vote the radicals into office in the elections proves that Libya is not a nation of extremists.
He was an extremely successful envoy, who traveled the country to meet with all groups of Libyan society, and did not confine himself to international circles in the capital.
I hope that the Libyan government will take this time to reflect on the security vacuum in the country, in particular around Benghazi, and rebuild the defense and security sectors in an accountable, professional and responsible manner.
For the international community, withdrawal of support from Libya will only play directly into the hands of jihadists, and that is the opposite of what we should do.
