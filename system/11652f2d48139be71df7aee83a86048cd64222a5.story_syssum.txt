The famed inventor, military hero and former boy scout, told CNN that advances in the use of GPS mean that the technology could not only emerge in the next few years, but is already being road tested by companies such as Google.
While he is now a professor emeritus at Stanford University in California, in the 1980s Parkinson headed up the GPS program run by the U.S. military.
"The air force didn't want it because first of all they thought we couldn't necessarily do it and secondly they are used to their old ways.
According to Parkinson, there are myriad possible uses for GPS that are yet to be explored, but one of the most immediate applications will be the integration of GPS technology into self-driving cars, which he believes will help bring down the incidence of road accidents.
"The most dangerous thing in an automobile is the driver.
It will include cooperation between cars; I will know where the next car is going and will be able to sense how good the friction is on the road, I can sense whether my tires are slipping.
For example, radar systems that measure the distance to the car that is ahead and begin slowing if the condition is hazardous.
Experts predict that the first self-driving cars may be on the roads by 2016.
