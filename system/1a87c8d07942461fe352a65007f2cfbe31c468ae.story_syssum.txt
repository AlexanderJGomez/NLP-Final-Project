The jury is still out on whether Freddy Adu -- like Lamptey Ghanaian-born -- will fall into the first category or the second, but the footballing world should soon be a little closer to finding out after the 18-year-old's move this week from the shallow waters of Real Salt Lake and the MLS to Benfica of Portugal.
Indeed, in the eyes of some -- unfairly -- Adu has already failed to live up to the expectations placed on him.
For a player feted as a future major world star though, Benfica is perhaps not the destination those who had mapped out his career along the lines of the Hollywood soccer trilogy "Goal" would have chosen.
Both subsequently moved onto greatness at Barcelona; U.S. soccer fans will be willing Adu to make a similar leap upwards from Benfica sooner rather than later.
