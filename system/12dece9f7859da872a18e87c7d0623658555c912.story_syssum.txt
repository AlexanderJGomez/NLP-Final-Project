(CNN) -- "The Borgias" are back for a second season and according to star Jeremy Irons we can expect even more nefarious plotting and lustful encounters.
CNN: The show is like "The Sopranos" in the Vatican.
Death was much more a part of life than it is today.
Would you be surprised if it was discovered that Pope Benedict has kids?
CNN: Your voice is like catnip to the ladies.
Irons: Well in truth, to be serious, I suppose it's not particularly good, but it does give me huge pleasure and allows me time for reflection.
But there will be one in a minute.
They stand there looking long suffering while their parents make me write them an autograph.
In a way, it never has much actually to do with what the movie's like.
Irons: I like the youth of the city and it has a slightly crumbly nature about it because they haven't quite got the money to finish everything off.
