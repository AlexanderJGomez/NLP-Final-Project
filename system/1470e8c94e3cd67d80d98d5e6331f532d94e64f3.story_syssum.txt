On Wednesday, authorities found Marco McMillian's body near a levee between Sherard and Rena Lara, two unincorporated communities about 15 minutes from Clarksdale.
The late politician's family, in the statement released through his former campaign manager Jarod Keith, called for "a full and thorough investigation."
The Coahoma County Sheriff's Office announced on Thursday that a suspect, Lawrence Reed, faces a murder charge in the death.
McMillian's short biography on Facebook said he had spent much of his career raising money for universities after he graduated from Jackson State with a degree in elementary education.
Patricia McMillian said that even though media reports since her son's death have labeled him as openly gay, his death likely had nothing to do with his sexual orientation.
