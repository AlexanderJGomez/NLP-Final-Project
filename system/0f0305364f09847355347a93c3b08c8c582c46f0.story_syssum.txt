Livingston, Wisconsin (CNN) -- It's the end of the day in rural southwest Wisconsin, and the Trocke family wanders through a ditch along a county road, their eyes fixed on the earth.
It all began the evening of April 14, when what looked like a giant fireball came crashing through the atmosphere.
By definition, those pieces are what scientists call meteorites: the remnants of the meteor that don't burn up along the journey and instead make it all the way to the ground.
Farmer headed to the sleepy Wisconsin village of Livingston, which was about to become ground zero for the latest meteorite hunt.
McCluskey found a rock that one of the experts confirmed was a meteorite, weighing 35 grams.
Brian Nodolf, who lives on a farm near Livingston, said his wife found a meteorite weighing about 100 grams.
But what do the residents think about the influx of people to their small town?
His store has become a pseudo-trading post, where people looking for or wanting to sell meteorites have put their contact information on signs along the counter.
They'll do it all on their own.
