(CNN)The Baltimore mother who slapped her son several times and pulled him out of a protest told CNN on Wednesday she wasn't concerned that she might be embarrassing her son.
Graham told Cooper that she saw her son with a brick in his hand, and she lost control of her emotions and told him to drop it.
Graham said her son told her the night before the violence at the mall that something was up.
She went to the mall and focused on the teens who were tossing rocks and bricks.
Singleton said he had seen her, but it didn't make sense that his mother would be there.
But when he heard her voice, he realized it really was his mom -- and he was in big trouble.
Tameka Brown, one of Graham's five daughters, told CNN on Tuesday it wasn't that hard for her mom to spot her 16-year-old half-brother.
Her son said that once they got home from the mall he understood why she pulled him out of the crowd.
"I was embarrassed a little bit, until she just started talking to me when we got home," he said.
