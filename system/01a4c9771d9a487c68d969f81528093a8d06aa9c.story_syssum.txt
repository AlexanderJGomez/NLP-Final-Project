"The Taliban is down another 'shadow governor,' " the American source said of Salam.
The crackle of small-arms fire and the whoosh of outgoing mortar rounds from the Marines were clearly audible on the line as she described the battle.
"About five minutes ago, Taliban started attacking our area," she said shortly before 8 a.m.
There have been five casualties among the NATO-led forces during the operation, the forces said in a statement Thursday, without giving further details.
Across the border in Pakistan, four people were killed and five were wounded Thursday when a drone fired on a suspected militant compound in the country's tribal region, intelligence sources and a local political official said.
The remote-controlled aircraft fired two missiles at the compound in the Danday Darpakhel area of North Waziristan, one of seven districts in the tribal region along the Afghan border, the sources said.
Salam was arrested in Pakistan, the Afghan government and Taliban sources said, but they named different cities as the location of his capture.
Yaqubi said Salam and another Taliban "shadow governor," Mullah Salih, were arrested last week in the Pakistani city of Peshawar.
Taliban sources and Omar said other suspected members of the Afghan Taliban were arrested with Salam, but their identities are not clear.
