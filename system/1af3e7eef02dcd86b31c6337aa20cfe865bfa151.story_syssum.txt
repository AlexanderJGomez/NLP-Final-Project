The next day, November 20, the U.S. embassy in Abuja sent what is called a "Visas Viper cable" to the State Department detailing the father's concerns, according to an official account by State Department spokesman Ian Kelley.

Kelley said Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will ask the department's consular division to review all processes connected with issuing visas.
