(CNN) -- An uproar over treatment delays at the Department of Veterans Affairs is triggering a heated debate over whether it is too difficult to fire federal workers, with the House approving legislation on Wednesday that would make it easier to remove senior executives at the agency.
He said on Wednesday that he needed more time to review what was going on and promised accountability.
There are roughly 360 senior executives at Veterans Affairs, according to the Office of Personnel Management.
And even last year, when the VA was in line with the rest of the federal government on firing, critics still see that as a significant problem because the rates of termination in the federal government are substantially lower than in the private sector.
But just as some conservatives cry for removing red tape and speeding up the firing process for government executives, others insist the idea could easily harm good employees at the VA.
For example, he told the story of an IRS employee who came to his office saying others at the agency had suggested she could be fired and were pressuring her to over a recent high-profile congressional investigation of IRS targeting of conservative political groups.
"The operations of government need to be different in some ways than they are in the private sector.
But he argues that Congress needs to revamp the entire, outdated federal personnel policy for the government, not just make a sudden change at the VA.
"In instance after instance where mismanagement has led to veteran suffering, department officials have repeatedly pointed to non-disciplinary actions such as employee retirements and transfers or bureaucratic slaps on the wrist," said Miller when he introduced his bill in March.
Now that the House has acted, the matter moves over to the Senate where Florida's Marco Rubio has introduced a companion bill.
Senators asked the agency leader directly at a hearing last week on the scandal.
"That's not the question," replied Begich.
