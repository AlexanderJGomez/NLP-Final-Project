(CNN) -- India are poised to build a handy first-innings lead over South Africa after Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar scored centuries on the second day of the second cricket Test in Kolkata.
Sehwag, who was dropped by J.P. Duminy on 47, had threatened South African Jacques Kallis's record for the fastest half-century but suffered a brief lull in run flow before passing the mark in just 41 deliveries.
South Africa had resumed on 266-9 after a late collapse on Sunday, and tailenders Morne Morkel and Wayne Parnell added another 30 runs for a final-wicket stand of 35.
Meanwhile, New Zealand reached 258-5 on a rain-hit opening day of the one-off Test against tourists Bangladesh in Hamilton.
