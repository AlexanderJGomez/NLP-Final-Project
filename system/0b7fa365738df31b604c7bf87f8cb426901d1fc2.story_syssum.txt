However, when it came time to decide the fate of my sons' own genitalia, my wife and I bucked the trend and let them live as they were born.
And the American Academy of Pediatrics's newly revised policy statement will not, in my opinion, make the issue any clearer for expectant parents -- it remains artfully ambiguous.
I'm not worried about the hygiene issues that are potentially related to uncircumcised penises.
But I trust that I'll be able to convey the importance of proper condom use when my boys reach the appropriate age.
Either the men were adamant that their son look like them or they just didn't care if they didn't.
There is also an argument to be made that circumcision, in effect, mutilates the genitals of a minor without their consent, which strikes me as neither fair nor particularly holistic.
They went as far as to claim that there are as many good reasons for prohibition of male circumcision as there are for female genital mutilation.
I remember him telling me about the excruciating pain associated with the procedure.
So, even if we move away from Portland someday (and go ahead, make all the Portlandia jokes you want), the likelihood that my boys' penises will be accepted is pretty high.
