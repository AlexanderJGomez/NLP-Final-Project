I wasn't sure what to expect, but I did not want that experience to influence how I approached the country and its people.
I was a Peace Corps Volunteer in West Africa and the Rwandan genocide, right on the heels of Nelson Mandela's election in South Africa, was big news across the continent.
Rwanda's countryside is dotted with what appear to be literally a thousand hills that are a mixture of mountains, volcanoes and hillocks.
For anyone who has spent time in Africa, it's incredible to see people actually wearing helmets on motorcycles, drivers and passengers alike, both in Kigali and in the countryside.
Amid the beautiful parks and tea plantations are the somber genocide memorials found in virtually every community.
At the same time, they allow for personal reflection on mankind's capacity for both evil and resilience.
One room tells the tale of other genocides or "cleansing" events in history around the world, reminding us that the international community has not been diligent about the oft-quoted pledge, "Never again."
Though I have always considered myself a pretty tough and realistic humanitarian worker, I had never seen anything like this.
Looking at Rwandans today with a certainty that such an atrocity can never happen again, you wonder "How did this ever happen in the first place?"
Are we really a community in which most of us watched this suffering and death from the sidelines?
The lessons from Rwanda still echoing in my head, I was compelled to say "yes" to a country being torn apart by intercommunal fighting, just as Rwanda had been.
I pray that we can realize the same here in Central African Republic.
