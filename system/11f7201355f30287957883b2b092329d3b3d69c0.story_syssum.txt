Instead I set out on my activism by loudly condemning the culture of violence against women in these regions as if it were an isolated phenomenon from other longstanding gender-racial-religious injustices I witnessed.
Every day I see Pakistanis robbed of their dignity, their hope, and ultimately their sense of significance.
Instead, I blame the wealthy, powerful and educated elite for failing to humanize the masses.
These drastic policy shifts are likely counterintuitive to the power elite's longstanding views on governance, but a solution to "honor" murders and the many injustices and inequalities in Pakistani society starts here.
