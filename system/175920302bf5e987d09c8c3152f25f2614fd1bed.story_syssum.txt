As the follow-up to 2012's blockbuster comedy "21 Jump Street," "22 Jump Street" essentially rehashes everything about its predecessor but does so in a self-referential way that doesn't sacrifice humor.
The only thing that seemed truly worn out were some of the jokes about sexuality, observes Village Voice critic Stephanie Zacharek.
Part of the plot involves Jenko and Schmidt going their separate ways for a while as they fall into different social circles on campus, leading to "numerous homoerotic references to this fading friendship, but only in a 'Totally yankin' your chain, bro!'
... (But) '22 Jump Street' isn't uncharitable or mean-spirited; at worst, it's just confused."
