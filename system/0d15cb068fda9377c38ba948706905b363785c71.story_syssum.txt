(CNN) -- The Space Shuttle Discovery launched late Thursday afternoon from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, marking the start of its 39th and final flight.
And NASA halted its countdown on Thursday, at five minutes, because of a computer problem related to safety on the "eastern range."
But the NASA administrator called these incidents "typical" and likely harmless, since they came off "after the area of concern" when the atmosphere was so thin to make its impact negligible.
The last scheduled launch of Space Shuttle Endeavour is set for April 19 and will be commanded by Mark Kelly, the husband of U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who is recovering from being shot last month in Tucson, Arizona.
"What is not acceptable is the fact that the most powerful nation in the  world, the United States of America, finds itself in a situation that  we didn't do the proper planning to have a vehicle in place to replace  shuttle when it lands its last landing," Charles Bolden said.
