(CNN) -- Some years ago, I interviewed a pair of farmers selling pastured, hormone- and antibiotic-free turkeys for $4.75 a pound.
But if they enticed enough Thanksgiving cooks to prepare them, the farmers saw a win for biodiversity and the birds.
I thought of those birds recently when College Board President and CEO David Coleman explained sweeping changes planned for the SAT exam.
You flipped through their definitions on flash cards, or faced them in a spelling bee, if you were that kind of kid.
After the frenzy and stress of SAT cramming, the words become kind of a parenthetical joke, a chance to finally giggle at the absurdity of it all.
If the college exam tests only obscure vocabulary words, "students stop reading and start flipping," he said.
Sure, those quick definitions did well enough for a multiple choice test.
"Under the guise of providing more user-friendly, fair tests, they're merely substituting one set of SAT words for another," Nunberg said.
Regardless, the test will never get much credit; if you memorize a word and use it often enough, he said, you're unlikely to be able to pinpoint that you learned it for the SAT.
Consider just one of the changes coming to the SAT in 2016: Each exam will include passages from meaningful historic documents like the Declaration of Independence, the Federalist Papers and the Rev.
Educators, do not celebrate the end of flash cards.
