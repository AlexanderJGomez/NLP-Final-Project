Nikhil Kumar, former police commissioner of New Delhi and head of an association of retired officers from the Indian capital, charged that almost all Indian states had been reluctant to carry out police reforms.

"It's time for the government to stop talking about reform and fix the system," said Brad Adams, HRW's Asia director, in a statement.
