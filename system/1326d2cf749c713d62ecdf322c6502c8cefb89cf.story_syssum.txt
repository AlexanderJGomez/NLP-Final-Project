The 26-year-old will face European Ryder Cup teammate Luke Donald in Sunday's final at Dove Mountain's Ritz-Carlton course after the Englishman made light work of his matches against Americans Ryan Moore and Matt Kuchar.
Westwood had been top of the rankings since the end of October, when he ended Tiger Woods' record reign, but he lost in the second round of the $8.5 million tournament.
Jimenez -- at 47 the oldest man in the initial 64-strong field -- reduced the gap to one as Kaymer lost his accuracy, but then failed to find the green in regulation at the last.
Donald then thrashed U.S. Ryder Cup player and 2010 PGA Tour money list champion Kuchar 6 & 5 in the first semifinal to be completed.
Yang, who beat U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell on Friday, was never ahead in the match and trailed by four holes after the eighth, then Kuchar matched his four consecutive pars to 17.
