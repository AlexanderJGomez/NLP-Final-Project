Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Elden Fox sent Lohan to jail four weeks ago, but another judge overturned the decision to deny the actress bail later that day.
In July, Judge Marsha Revel ordered the actress to serve 90 days in jail and 90 days in rehab for violating her probation.
However, Lohan failed a drug test less than a month later, triggering Friday's probation violation hearing.
Just two weeks after checking out of a Malibu, California, drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility, she was arrested again in July 2007 after a woman called Santa Monica, California, police, saying Lohan was trying to run her down with a car.
