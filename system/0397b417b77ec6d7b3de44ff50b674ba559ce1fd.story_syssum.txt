Daniel Flesch, then a college student at the University of Illinois, had heard too much anti-Israeli sentiment.
Flesch, now a graduate student at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, became what's known as a "lone soldier" --  a citizen from another country who joins the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
Although there are no firm numbers of those who have signed up in recent days, the interest level of Americans seems to have increased amid the escalating conflict between Israel and Hamas, according to Orit Mizner, southwest regional director for Friends of Israel Scouts, an organization that helps North American Jews stay connected to Israel.
The U.S. government doesn't discourage those wanting to join, but some may question why those willing to put themselves in harm's way would choose the IDF as opposed to the American military.
Flesch, who is not an Israeli citizen, served more than 18 months.
He became a paratrooper in the Israeli army and was recognized twice as the outstanding soldier of his platoon.
