The University of Aberdeen, Scotland and the UK's National Health Service (NHS) have embarked on a four month study on people over 70 to observe any changes in balance after regular use of the Wii Fit.
Dr Alison Stewart, who devised the study said she came up with the idea while working in the Osteoporosis department at the University of Aberdeen, after seeing a large number of fractures in old people who had fallen.
"That's when I looked up the Wii and discovered it is very similar to the other equipment, but less expensive.
They ultimately hope to determine the effectiveness of computer games in developing muscle strength and co-ordination and reducing the risk of falls for people with Parkinson's.
These people are nine times more likely to fall over than someone without the disease and falls in this older age group can be very serious."
Her bowling partner Fisher told CNN he recently played the boxing game on Wii Fit with his four-year-old great-grandson.
"It really spans all ages, although my great-grandson knocked me out twice," the former bricklayer said.
