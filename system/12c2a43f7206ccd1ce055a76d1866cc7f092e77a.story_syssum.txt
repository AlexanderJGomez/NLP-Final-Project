ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Four prominent neurologists say they cannot see how Sen. Pete Domenici can continue his work as a U.S. senator given his diagnosis with frontotemporal lobar degeneration, a type of dementia.
"For at least two years, I have felt very little impact from this disease," he said in announcing his decision.
Dr. Murray Grossman, a neurologist at the University of Pennsylvania, noted the difficulties the disease presents for people who make decisions on others' behalf.
In addition to problems with judgment, FTLD patients have behavior and language issues, because of the areas of the brain that are affected.
"Someone who's usually very adept and in touch with people might suddenly make inappropriate or caustic comments, like they might refer to someone who's overweight as 'fatty,'" Knopman says.
"One of the problems with this disorder is they often lack insight so they themselves don't perceive the problems," Knopman said.
