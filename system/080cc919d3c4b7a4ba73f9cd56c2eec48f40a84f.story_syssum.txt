(CNN)  -- Tamil Tiger rebels acknowledged the death of their leader Sunday, nearly a week after the Sri Lankan government said it had recovered the body of Velupillai Prabhakaran and declared victory in the country's 25-year civil war with the rebels.
A short time after the presidential address, the military announced that it had recovered the body of Prabhakaran, leader and founder of the Tamil Tigers.
Prabhakaran founded the Tamil Tigers, who have been declared a terrorist organization by 32 countries.
The rebels have fought for an independent state for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka since July 1983.
