Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had called for the dissolution as he sacked two senior members of his coalition Cabinet for criticizing government policy.
Netanyahu told reporters last week that a divided government was one of Israel's problems, saying there was a lot of debate, contradictions and ultimatums.
I will not tolerate ministers attacking the government's policy and its head from inside the government."
A poll for Israel's Channel 2 suggested that 55% of those surveyed were against another election being held so soon.
CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet wrote the story in Atlanta.
