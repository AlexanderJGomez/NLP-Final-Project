New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Authorities have completed an autopsy of Ram Singh, one of the men accused of gang raping and fatally beating a woman on a New Delhi bus.
"If prisons are to be considered rational institutions, rather than horrible holding pens, then prisoners' rights should be of utmost importance, and their protection the state's strongly held commitment," wrote The Indian Express newspaper in an editorial Tuesday.
The gang rape, and the woman's subsequent death from injuries, prompted angry protests over the country's treatment of women and handling of sexual attacks.
The December rape gripped India and led to calls for stricter laws on sexual assault and changes in cultural attitudes toward women.
