(CNN) -- Israel's military said Tuesday it shot down a Syrian warplane over the Golan Heights amid what it described as growing tensions in the border area.
Militants in the area are trying to dislodge Syrian government forces from their last two strongholds in the area, the group said.
"As the civil war rages in Syria, IDF forces have experienced combat in the region, both from targeted strikes and errant fire," it said.
The incidents occurred after Syrian rebel fighters took control of the border crossing in Quneitra in late August.
