Half of $1 million spent on a video game that is now helping terrorists train for missions.
These are just a few examples from the 100 entry-long list in a book detailing government waste, compiled by retiring GOP Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma.
The space agency is spending $3 billion on the ISS this year and will conduct studies, many proposed by elementary students, including one on the "design and creation of better golf clubs."
The foundation spent $171,000 to teach monkeys how to play video games and gamble in order to "unlock the secrets of free will," according to the report.
"The real shock and awe may have been the $1 billion price tag the Pentagon paid to destroy $16 billion worth of ammunition, enough to pay a full years' salary for over 54,000 Army privates," said Coburn.
The book notes a 2014 Government Accountability Office investigation which concluded poor record keeping was the reason the military purchased so much ammunition it didn't need.
