I dialed the number and signed up with a private cord blood storage bank on the spot.
A recent study from the University of California, San Francisco, estimates the total average cost to be $3,620, which includes initial banking and storage for 20 years, at which point users must decide to either continue paying storage fees or donate or discard the cord blood.
Otherwise, families are encouraged to donate their newborn's cord blood to a public bank (if accessible in the area) for free, much like donating blood or an organ; in other words, the donated unit is not reserved for the family who provided it.
The National Marrow Donor Program offers the related Donor Cord Blood Program, which allows eligible families to store cord blood at no cost to treat an affected sibling.
