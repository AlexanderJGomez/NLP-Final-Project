That's more than the TSA has seized in any other year of its existence, and it's a 22% increase from the 1,813 guns seized in 2013.
The department's employees "stand on the front lines protecting our nation from dangerous contraband and people, while ensuring the free flow of lawful trade and commerce -- just two aspects of our mission," Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in a news release.
Passengers whose guns are spotted by TSA security during the screening process can be arrested by airport or local police and face criminal charges, and the TSA can impose civil penalties.
"It is a reminder that passengers should check their personal belongings before arriving at the TSA checkpoint to ensure they do not have any prohibited items in their possession," TSA spokesman Ross Feinstein said.
The TSA also found more than 1,400 firearm components, replica firearms, stun guns and other "dangerous objects" in carry-on luggage.
Check them or ship them ahead of time.
