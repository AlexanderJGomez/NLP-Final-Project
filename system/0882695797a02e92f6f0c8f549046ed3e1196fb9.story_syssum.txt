Unlike the SpaceX Dragon capsule, which is designed to be reused and eventually carry passengers, the can-shaped, 17-foot Cygnus is a one-shot craft that will burn up on re-entry after its flight to the space station.

SpaceX has so far made two of its 12 scheduled flights to the ISS under a $1.6 billion contract.
