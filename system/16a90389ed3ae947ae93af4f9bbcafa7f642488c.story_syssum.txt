Apollo missions took the first men to the moon, space shuttles carried the Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station into space -- all on rockets taking off from two launchpads at Kennedy Space Center, an hour east of Orlando.
a tour guide asks laughing guests on a bus taking them to the space center recently for one of the new tours.
Once inside the large cavernous building, look up to the ceiling where shuttle mission banners filled with the signatures of the personnel who worked on those missions hang from support beams.
NASA says Atlantis will be moved to a shuttle hanger on August 16 -- switching places with shuttle Endeavour, which will remain inside the assembly building until mid-September when it will be transported to the California Science Center in Los Angeles for permanent public display.
Control center tours visit Firing Room 4, where Apollo and shuttle managers directed launches.
"You'll feel the energy when you walk in this room," said English as the security officer opened the door.
"This is the window on mankind's future right here," says English, the guide, as we look out toward the launchpads, which appear much closer than three miles from the control center.
The new tours are expected to run through the end of December 2012 and possibly into 2013.
Each of the three tours costs an additional $25 for adults and $19 for children ages 3 to 11 beyond the entrance fee to the Kennedy Space Visitor Center, which is $45 for adults and $35 for children.
