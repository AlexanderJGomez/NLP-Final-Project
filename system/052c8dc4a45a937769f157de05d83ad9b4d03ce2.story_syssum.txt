(CNN) -- GOP presidential candidate Newt Gingrich got a good laugh from his audience of conservatives Friday when he ribbed the U.S. government for not using mail services, such as FedEx, to track down the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the nation.
It alleges that when the two 21-year-olds drove to FedEx in January 2010, ICE officials arrested Gonzalez and then went to the car where Vasquez was waiting, held her at gunpoint and separated her from her then 2-year-old son, a U.S. citizen.
Gonzalez was deported; Vasquez, who was reunited with her child a few hours later, is fighting to remain in the United States.
"There's nothing amusing about the idea of government using corporate efficiency in order to violate people's rights," said De Leon, who has filed a suit against ICE and FedEx in U.S. District Court in Florida.
There should be a wall between the police function and corporate entities.
FedEx Senior Communications Specialist Chris Stanley said the company "has a long history of cooperation with law enforcement.
Turns out it was closer to the truth than he thought.
