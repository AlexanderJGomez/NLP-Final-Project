But that's how many Mac users are feeling after the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Orbitz was steering Mac users toward higher-priced hotels than PC users, based on spending habits discovered by one of the site's algorithms.
Others argued that buying a pricier computer would leave them less money for a vacation and make them more inclined to seek travel deals.
Meanwhile, rival travel sites Expedia, Priceline and Travelocity capitalized on the furor to insist that they don't use similar algorithms based on what type of computer their customers employ.
Orbitz, on the other hand, says it's trying to provide Mac users with the best hotel recommendations based on what other Mac users are choosing.
We are really excited about the potential to use this wisdom ... to make travel better for consumers," he said.
