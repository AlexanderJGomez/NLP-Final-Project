Fifteen teams of students drove photovoltaic-powered cars across the North American Solar Challenge finish line in Calgary Tuesday, led by the University of Michigan Solar Car Team and its vehicle, Continuum.
The college has fewer than 550 students, all of them undergraduates.
"It's unique, I think, for their college to field a team, (because) they don't have an engineering school," said Dan Eberle, NASC's organizer.
"We got to get out and walk across the finish line with (the car).
The Michigan team led almost the entire race from Texas, trailing only on the first day of driving when it had to stop to fix a minor electrical problem.
"There's two things that really make a team," he said, discussing Continuum's crew.
Luke Martz, director of fundraising for Iowa State University's PrISUm Solar Car Team, said he thought the difference between the types of cells teams used had a major impact on the race.
Darshni Pillay, operations manager for the University of Calgary Solar Car Team, disagreed about the advantage provided by the gallium cells.
She said the reason leading teams didn't have to "trailer" -- which is legal but incurs a time penalty -- was because they were able to get ahead of the weather, not because of any superior technology.
PrISUm's finish in the middle of the pack is noteworthy because the team barely managed to qualify for the race.
The teams from Durham University and Oregon State University, which also didn't qualify on the closed track, didn't make it to Neosho in time.
"Everyone's sympathetic to each other and wants to see all the other teams cross the finish line," she said.
