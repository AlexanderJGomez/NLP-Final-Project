Dr. Helena Ndume, the head of the eye department at Namibia's largest hospital, Windhoek Central, has dedicated her life to help to restore sight in a country where tens of thousands of people are suffering needlessly from a condition that is curable.
"You're changing the life of so many people, you make it easier for them and it is also productive for the country -- you help people who are taking care of their grandchildren, contributing to the economy of the country, this is very, very good," she adds.
There, she was housed in camps of the South West Africa People's Organization where she was told that becoming a fashion designer was not an acceptable career path.
"There was that few operations, people who came really blind with visual acuity who could only see light perception -- they went back seeing again and that's how the message spread like wildfire," says Ndume.
"She is inexhaustible, she is an incredible physician, very capable but also able to motivate people and she's been able to get the governor of Namibia to support her and her colleagues.
