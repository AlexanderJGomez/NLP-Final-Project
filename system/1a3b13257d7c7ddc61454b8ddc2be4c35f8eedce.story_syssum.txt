Washington (CNN) -- A judge on Monday ordered the release of sealed documents and transcripts from court proceedings related to the murder case of Chandra Levy, a Washington intern whose disappearance in 2001 drew national headlines and damaged a U.S. congressman's political career.
Armando Morales, a convicted felon and former gang member, testified at Guandique's trial that Guandique confessed to him that he killed Levy.
Her skull was found a year later in Washington's Rock Creek Park and she was identified through dental records.
A group of media outlets including the Associated Press, Gannett, McClatchy, The Washington Post and Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press filed court papers seeking to unseal the information.
