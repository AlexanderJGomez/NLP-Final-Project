So said Hollywood star Angelina Jolie on Tuesday in London, as she opened the biggest summit of its kind aimed at ending the scourge of sexual violence in conflict.
The four-day Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, hosted by the UK government, will bring together representatives of more than 100 countries, as well as hundreds more experts, survivors, faith leaders, and staffers from NGOs and international organizations.
It is up to everyone to help make this summit a turning point, Jolie said, and to work across borders, governments and religious faiths to bring an end to the use of rape and sexual violence in war.
According to UNICEF, about 40% of Congolese women are believed to have been subjected to some form of sexual violence at some point in their lives, while in the most recent conflict in South Sudan, rape has been used by both sides of the conflict during fighting.
In an online post, the agency recounts the "sadly typical" story of a woman in Goma in the Democratic Republic of the Congo whose daughter, born from rape, was called a witch and herself raped, at age 6, by her 14-year-old cousin.
