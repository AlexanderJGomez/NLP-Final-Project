L'AQUILA, Italy (CNN) -- Leaders of both industrialized powers and emerging economies have agreed to work together on setting a goal to limit global warming to levels recommended by scientists, U.S. President Barack Obama said at the G-8 summit.
He called the commitment of the emerging economies "an important stride forward" in minimizing climate change, but acknowledged that the issue he called one of the most challenging of our times would be difficult to confront.
And Oxfam spokesman Antonio Hill said: "Today 17 countries, responsible for more than 80 percent of the world's emissions, agreed for the first time that it'd be nice to take the road which stops the planet heating up by more than 2 degrees.
In the United States, Congress is debating a new energy policy that could codify the G-8 target for emissions reductions in law.
It acknowledged that industrial powers have emitted most of the pollution causing climate change and therefore have a greater responsibility in responding.
Todd Stern, Obama's special envoy for climate change, noted that China and other emerging economies had never previously acknowledged the 2-degree Celsius threshold or committed to reducing emissions from current levels.
The pope challenged bankers to turn away from the practices blamed for bringing about the global economic crisis and instead use their power to help the world create wealth and economic development.
After his meeting with the pope, the first U.S. African-American president will make his first trip as chief executive to Africa, traveling to Accra, Ghana.
