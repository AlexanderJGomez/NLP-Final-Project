One winning ticket was sold at a Publix supermarket in Zephyrhills, Florida, according to David Bishop, deputy secretary of the Florida lottery.
It marks the largest in Powerball history, surpassing a $587.6 million jackpot split by winners in Arizona and Missouri in November.
If there had been no winner in Saturday's Powerball, the jackpot would have shot up to $925 million for Wednesday's drawing, according to Kelly Cripe, spokeswoman for the Texas Lottery, which is part of the Powerball game.
But that didn't stop hundreds from driving to the Trex Mart in Dearborn, Missouri, where one of two winning tickets was sold in last year's $587 million Powerball drawing.
In Florida, winners must claim prizes at a state lottery retailer or lottery district office on or before the 180th day after the drawing.
