The ancient world was full of strange animals that have gone extinct, such as a group of marine species with claw-like structures emerging from their heads.
This creature belongs to the Alalcomenaeus genus, and its place in the animal kingdom lies in "a group of weird extinct animals" called the "megacheiran" or "great appendage" arthropods, Ma said.
The brain and central nervous system of the creature are organized in a way that is similar to those of the chelicerata, the group that includes horseshoe crabs and scorpions.
One kind of scan revealed that iron had built up in the nervous system as the creature fossilized.
If researchers find a fossil with features shared by this creature and the crustacean-like fossil Ma and colleagues found last year, that could be a common ancestor of both.
There's plenty more weirdness from ancient history to uncover.
