Like any budding skier, Daniel Albrecht had always dreamed of triumphing at the foot of Austria's Hahnenkamm mountain but instead, six years ago, he lay face down on the snow, out cold within meters of the finish line.
A minor error on his part -- exacerbated by the fact he was traveling at 140 kph (87 mph) -- saw his skis flap wildly out of control as he battled to regain his balance for 40 meters in the air before landing heavily on his back.
Albrecht is able to laugh as he retells the incident, in part helped by the fact he has no recall of the savage beating he took on the final meters of the Kitzb√ºhel course even after watching it back on a few occasions.
In the early weeks of his recovery from his brain trauma he did not have the strength to even feed himself.
Amazingly, it was just a week after being released from the neurological unit that cared for him that he was back skiing despite the inherent dangers of the sport.
Slow as the process may have seemed initially, within two years, he was back on the World Cup circuit although not quite the same force he previously was.
On his return to the sport, the doctors had warned him he might suffer headaches at altitude.
Persuading his family, his wife in particular, of that fact was the harder part but, in the end, they knew they could not stand in the way of his desire and the thing that made him tick as a human being.
Now, he runs his own clothes line, Albright, and also mentors young skiers giving the 30-year-old a new career in the sport.
Part of him, the racer within, would like to be in that start gate to tackle the slope on which he was lucky to survive.
