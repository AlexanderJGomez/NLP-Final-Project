Standing in rain -- some holding umbrellas and others letting the water wash over their bowed heads -- people in Newtown gathered outside various locations and paused as multiple churches rang their bells, once for each victim.
People also paused elsewhere in town -- under a tent that covered the numerous flowers and stuffed animals left as a memorial -- and outside various churches.
In the state Capitol building in Hartford, a bell was rung for each of the school's 26 victims after their names were read.
Earlier, in a letter to other governors across the country, Malloy noted how the shooting in his state has resonated nationwide.
People mourned on the Internet, as well: Some websites went dark at the urging of Silicon Valley venture capitalist Ron Conway, who came up with the idea at a Christmas party attended by Gabby Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was wounded in a 2011 shooting that killed six.
Perry also asked that churches ring their bells 26 times in honor of the victims at the school.
Like so many Americans, I wish there were something -- anything -- I could do or say to ease your anguish," Michelle Obama wrote.
"This is one of those things, and something like this points out we have way less control over things than we think we do."
More than 2,200 miles west of Newtown, in Ogden, Utah, the hometown of shooting victim Emilie Parker was festooned Thursday with pink ribbons as her parents brought her body back for burial.
Three 6-year-olds were among those buried Thursday: Allison Wyatt, who loved to draw and wanted to be an artist; Benjamin Wheeler, who loved the Beatles; and red-haired Catherine Hubbard, who loved animals.
Also buried Thursday, at an undisclosed location, was Nancy Lanza, the shooter's mother, said Donald Briggs, a friend of the family who grew up with her in Kingston, New Hampshire.
