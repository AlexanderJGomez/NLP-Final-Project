The way he chewed his cigar in the opening credits of "The Sopranos."
You're like Mozart,' " David Chase, who created "The Sopranos," said in a statement.
He had a small role in the 1992 Broadway revival of "A Streetcar Named Desire" with Alec Baldwin and Jessica Lange, and appeared in such films as the Quentin Tarantino-written "True Romance" (1993), "Get Shorty" (1995) and "A Civil Action" (1998).
And, in fact, it was all these things, held together on screen by Gandolfini as woebegone Mafia chief (or was that "waste management professional"?)
Gandolfini was one of three finalists for the role, Alan Sepinwall observed in his terrific TV history, "The Revolution Was Televised."
"At one time, I had said that this thing could be like a live-action 'Simpsons,' " Chase told Sepinwall.
And with Gandolfini, Edie Falco, Michael Imperioli, Lorraine Bracco and so many more, "The Sopranos" gave life to the scripts.
The other, "Join the Club," features an out-of-body experience in which Tony -- in a coma -- imagines he's an optics salesman named Kevin Finnerty.
(He worked to get himself into Tony's frame of mind, Gandolfini told "Inside the Actors Studio," as noted in The New York Times' obituary.
He played a general in "In the Loop" and the CIA director in "Zero Dark Thirty," neither role showy or outsized.
He could have played the part as a "Great Santini"-like martinet, or a befuddled softie, or an ignorant suburban climber.
Instead, he manages to fill it with grace notes, amused one minute, frustrated the next, finally a loving father quietly handing his son some money as the boy prepares to drive away.
