As Ad-Rock proudly declares on their excellent new "Hot Sauce Committee Part Two," "Oh, my God, just look at me/Grandpa been rapping since '83!"
Now cheekily retitled "Hot Sauce Committee Part Two," it's their first album in seven years, unless you count 2007's stoner-funk instrumental throwaway, "The Mix-Up."
Amid references to Rotary Connection and Ted Danson, Ad-Rock drops the best line: "Can't tell me nothing, can't tell me nada/Don't quote me now because I'm doing the Lambada."
So it's no surprise that on "Hot Sauce Committee Part Two" they make no effort to accommodate or even acknowledge any of the latest hip-hop trends.
Nobody would want to hear the Beasties try anything else.
