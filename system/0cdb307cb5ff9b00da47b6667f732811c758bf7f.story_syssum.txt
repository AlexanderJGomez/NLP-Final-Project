Five minutes into the ride, Prepas delivered the first twin with no problem.
But then, she saw two feet beginning to emerge -- a breech baby.
A year before Katrina, she traveled to Afghanistan with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to figure out why so many mothers and babies were dying at a hospital in Kabul.
Based out of San Diego, Prepas was a member of California's Disaster Medical Assistance Team, a group of about 30 physicians, general practitioners, nurses, nurse practitioners and other specialists.
Elderly patients from nursing homes had been dropped off, without medications or even adult diapers.
They set up three tents at the front of the airport -- green, for walking wounded and pregnant women; yellow, for slightly more serious conditions; red, for critical patients.
She was sleeping on a luggage carousel when the first woman in labor arrived.
The woman's husband and two sons were at the convention center with no idea she was in labor, or where she had gone.
The paramedics radioed a hospital in Baton Rouge to let them know they were bringing a woman in labor with twins.
Prepas has curtailed most of her overseas humanitarian missions; she now flies mostly to places in need within the U.S. -- the quake in Haiti being an exception.
A member of the White Ribbon Alliance for Safe Motherhood, Prepas has used the experience to bring attention to rising maternal mortality rates inside the United States, one of the worst in the industrialized world.
It drives me to keep wanting to do all this stuff.
