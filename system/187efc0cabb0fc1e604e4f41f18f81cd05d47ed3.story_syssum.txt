Bowe Bergdahl, let's get these points out of the way: the case for leaving no soldier behind is a sound and important one — a way to keep faith with our troops.

Should National Security Adviser Susan Rice have thought twice before describing him as someone who "served with honor and distinction."
"The point is, you have to get him home as a way to keep faith with our troops," says a former senior national security official.
So let's start at the policy end of all of this.
"This (The Bergdahl swap) is tying up loose ends," says another former senior national security source.
Trouble is, Republicans are playing at it, too.
Years of internal deliberations have gone into this, according to my sources.
Because right now, it looks like the lack of consultation is about one thing: the knowledge that there would be pushback.
At least they're consistent: micromanaging foreign policy from the west wing has always been a hallmark.
Ironically, my sources say, the bin Laden raid itself complicated events: If Bergdahl was in Pakistan, would that inflame an already inflamed relationship due to the bin Laden raid?
The backdrop to all of this is that the same questions that are now being raised publicly had been raised internally for years — about what a "fair" trade would include.
Bergdahl gets to go home.
What lingers, sadly, is the unsettling reality that five really, really bad guys have a ticket home, too.
