The kerfuffle at hand dates to 2007, when the North Dakota Board of Higher Education agreed to retire the Fighting Sioux nickname by August 15, 2011, in accordance with the NCAA's then-2-year-old policy on Native American mascots.
The nickname controversy appeared to be closer to a resolution Friday when Dalrymple and other state officials traveled to Indianapolis to meet with NCAA officials in a last-ditch effort to resolve the matter.
"When we invited (North Dakota's football team) into the (Big Sky) conference this was not an issue," he said.
"I have come to the conclusion that the cost of retaining the Sioux logo is too great," the NCAA press release quoted Dalrymple as saying.
In 2005, the NCAA sought to end the controversy surrounding Native American mascots once and for all by ordering nearly 20 schools whose nicknames and mascots they deemed "abusive in terms of race, ethnicity or national origin" to either get Native American permission to use their name and likeness, or to come up with a new one.
The Florida State Seminoles, University of Utah Utes and the Central Michigan University Chippewas each obtained permission from their respective namesake tribes to stay the course.
But the Fighting Sioux of the University of North Dakota -- winners of seven national championships in men's ice hockey -- was denied such an endorsement from the Tribal Council of the Standing Rock Sioux.
