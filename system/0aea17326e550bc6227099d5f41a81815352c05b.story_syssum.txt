(CNN) -- From the single, centrally-positioned seat to the crash-proof frame, this Formula One-like car is an alluring piece of kit.
The startling concept is the result of collaboration with MIT's pioneering Self-Assembly Lab, which seeks to programme materials to build themselves, and transform how we make things.
Trying to find more elegant solutions seems an obvious target, and what we're proposing is a single material with the same actuation capability, the same sensing, the same range of movement, if not more."
"We can develop material compositions that respond to many different triggers, or find solutions that haven't been programmed but fall within an acceptable range.
Fashion and furniture are also targets -- making the self-lacing sneakers of 'Back to the Future' a possibility at last.
"Our clients are looking for the next big idea, they are actively seeking innovation and believe this could transform manufacturing," says Kahn.
"If you have products that know how to mould and assemble based on energy, it takes out the menial labor that has forced manufacturers to relocate abroad where it's cheaper."
Another fear is it will get out of control, or be abused.
