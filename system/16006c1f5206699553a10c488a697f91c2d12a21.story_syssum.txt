Most of the questions I had been asked up until that time revolved around the logistics of signing up, whether they could pick a particular doctor and how much all this was going to cost.
Now she has a place to live, and she's excited about the prospect of finally being able to get private health care insurance for the first time in her life.
Let me try to explain: In a state that has chosen not to expand Medicaid, Yvonne is in the staggering position of now making too much money to qualify for Medicaid, and too little to obtain subsidies through the Affordable Care Act.
But in order to qualify for subsidies in South Carolina, she needs to get above the poverty line, and she is not quite there.
When I described Yvonne's situation to Bevin, he was sympathetic but immediately replied, "Where is the money going to come from?"
In the states that accepted Medicaid expansion, the federal government will pick up 100% of the tab for four years.
The man who oversees the health insurance expansion in Maryland, Dr Joshua Sharfstein, was stunned that so many states turned the money down.
One small solace is that she won't be forced to pay any tax penalty for not having insurance.
