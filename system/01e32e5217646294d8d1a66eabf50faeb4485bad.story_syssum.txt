The colossal squid's eyes were measured at about 27 centimeters (10.8 inches) across by researchers, who have been defrosting it and a smaller specimen at Te Papa, the national museum of New Zealand.
Scientists snaked a camera into the colossal squid's body and measured its beak and tentacles in an exam broadcast live on the Internet.
"It didn't seem really fair that only a handful of people would get to see an animal like this up close," said Steve O'Shea, a marine biologist at the Auckland University of Technology.
Researchers determined it was a colossal squid, a species first documented in 2003 that tends to weigh more than the also-big giant squid.
When they measured the colossal squid's beak, O'Shea said, they were stunned to discover that it was shorter than colossal-squid beaks recovered from the stomachs of sperm whales, which prey on squid.
