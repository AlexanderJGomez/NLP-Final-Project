"The Bourne Supremacy" started with $52.5 million on the way to $176.2 million, and 2007′s "The Bourne Ultimatum" started with $69.3 million en route to a $227.5 million finish.
The R-rated laugher kicked off its run in the same range as Ferrell's last live-action wide release "The Other Guys" ($35.5 million), and Galifianakis' last non-"Hangover" comedy "Due Date" ($32.7 million).
Political tales "Man of the Year" (2006) and "Swing Vote" (2008, an election year), grossed only $37.3 million and $16.3 million, respectively.
Due to heavy competition, Warner Bros.' other big release, "The Dark Knight Rises," slipped into third place with $19.5 million, a 45 percent drop from last weekend.
Sony paid just $15 million to acquire "Hope Springs" from Mandate, who shelled out $29 million to produce the film, and if it proves as leggy as some of Streep's other films — "Julie and Julia" climbed to $94.1 million after a $20 million weekend, and "It's Complicated" earned $122.7 million after a $22.1 million debut -- it will become a profitable mid-level hit for the studios.
Its predecessor, "Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules," had earned $38.2 million at the same point in its run, but that film started with $23.7 million, while "Dog Days" started with just $14.6 million — a difference of $9.1 million.
"The Dark Knight Rises" -- $19.5 million
