Barring a major upset, the task of banishing the storm clouds and restoring normality after the tumultuous events of the last seven months will fall to Petro Poroshenko, the veteran insider who won national approval by becoming the only oligarch to support the Maidan protest movement that overthrew Viktor Yanukovych earlier this year.
The thing that might just make this possible is the prevailing mood of weariness among voters and the realization that the main beneficiaries of continued uncertainty would be Vladimir Putin and those working to break the country apart.
Poroshenko's preference would be to keep Arseny Yatsenyuk as prime minister, not least because of the credibility he has established with the IMF and Western governments, while broadening the government to include former Party of the Regions people from the east.
It may take a painful split within the democratic bloc followed by a major realignment and new parliamentary elections in the autumn before Poroshenko gets the government he wants.
With tax rises, wages freezes, spending cuts and large hikes in energy prices on the way under the economic reform program agreed with the IMF, the new president's honeymoon period won't extend very far into the autumn unless he can convince Ukrainians that the foundations of recovery are being built.
Greater flexibility on the gas price and Ukraine's outstanding gas bill would help to ease the country's weak financial position.
The mood among the protesters certainly seems to have darkened during the course of the election campaign with many dismissing it as a reversion to politics as usual.
This is what his advisers seem to have in mind when they talk about the "new rules of the game;" reducing the political influence of oligarchs, insisting that they pay their taxes and ending the culture of favoritism in public procurement.
