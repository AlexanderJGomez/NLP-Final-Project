Guadalupe Arizpe De La Vega insists on returning to her hometown to preserve the Hospital de la Familia, a health center she started more than 30 years ago.
"We were going under a bridge and there was a body upside down without a head, hanging there with all the blood flowing," she recalls.
Despite the violence, De La Vega's hospital and its staff -- which treats about 900 patients daily, regardless of their ability to pay -- have remained unharmed.
De La Vega, who is married to a prominent businessman from Juarez, lived there for decades, but the escalating violence, murder, crime and corruption recently forced her to move to El Paso.
De La Vega says she has lost friends and neighbors in the conflict, but she insists she's not afraid -- and she's determined to help the people of Juarez continue receiving the medical care they need.
She became an advocate for maternal and infant health in the early 1970s after reading a newspaper article about an impoverished mother of nine, pregnant with her 10th child, who tried to kill her fetus by stabbing herself in the stomach.
But when De La Vega opened the doors to a desperate woman in labor, it started a decades-long expansion process that recently resulted in the birth of the facility's 100,000th baby.
And De La Vega is always looking for ways to provide more services to the community.
Although the Hospital de la Familia does charge patients who are able to pay, it does not currently make a profit -- though it hopes to be sustainable one day.
I get the privilege of experiencing the magic moment of change from sickness to health, from darkness to light, from apathy to enthusiasm.
