The source says the problem in part stemmed from the pope instructing drivers not to avoid crowds.
The pope traveled Wednesday morning to the town of Aparecida, the site of a shrine to Our Lady of Aparecida, a clay statue of the Virgin Mary and one of the patron saints of Brazil.
The pope also announced that he will return to Brazil in 2017, the 300th anniversary of the apparition of Our Lady of Aparecida to three fishermen.
