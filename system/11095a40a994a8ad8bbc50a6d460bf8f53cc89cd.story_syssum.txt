Most of the recent violence has been committed by young street-level drug dealers who work for the Sinaloa or Juarez cartels, Reyes Ferriz said.
In the past 45 days, 10 percent of those killed in Juarez had been deported from the United States in the past two years, Reyes Ferriz said.
But according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the U.S. agency that oversees deportations, the number of criminal deportees entering Juarez from El Paso, Texas, is not high.
Not all were Mexican, so not all left the United States by crossing into Juarez, she added.
In a recent conversation, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the United States would work to give Juarez more details about who is being dropped off on its doorstep, Reyes Ferriz said.
By comparison, the homicide rate in New Orleans, Louisiana, by far the deadliest city in the United States in 2008, was 64 homicides per 100,000 residents, based on preliminary FBI figures.
