(CNN) -- Heavy rain, hilly terrain and inadequate equipment slowed efforts to recover hundreds of people feared killed by a massive landslide in eastern Uganda, officials said Thursday.
Residents from nearby villages joined in, some armed with garden tools, while others used their bare hands.
The Red Cross, United Nations and World Food Program are helping provide food, water and other essentials, such as blankets, to the displaced, officials said.
A select few attended the service, because of the risk of more landslides, Ecweru said.
Most of the bodies were recovered from a hospital engulfed by the landslide after residents sought shelter, officials said.
The landslide occurred near Mount Elgon, on the Kenya-Uganda border.
