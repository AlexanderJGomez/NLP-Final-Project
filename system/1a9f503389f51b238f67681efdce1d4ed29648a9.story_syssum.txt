But cab driver Gerardo Gamboa and his bosses on Friday still weren't revealing the name of the 28-year-old professional gambler, whom they earlier described as a famous figure on the poker circuit.
The brown paper bag, with wads of $100 bills inside, was discovered when Gamboa picked up his next fare.
He didn't say hi or bye but he was an outstanding person, his attitude and everything, and how grateful he is since I found his money."
The office of President Benigno Aquino III called the cab company and said it will send a resolution of commendation to him, said Bill Shranko, chief operations officer at Yellow Checker Star.
Those who make their living in the cab business are enjoying the moment: Cabbies are no longer maligned -- whether it's for running up the fare or refusing to stop when hailed on the street -- and are generating international good will, Gamboa's boss said.
That's where the cabbie picked up the forgetful gambler and proved his honesty in a town better known as sin city.
