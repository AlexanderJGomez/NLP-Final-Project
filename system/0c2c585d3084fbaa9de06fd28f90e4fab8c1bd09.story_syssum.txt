Ethnic tensions in the South Sudan state of Jonglei have flared as tribes fight over grazing lands and water rights, disagreements that have dissolved into cattle raids and abduction of women and children.
The nonprofit group Medecins sans Frontieres, also known as Doctors Without Borders, was still trying Monday to reach 117 of its 130 aid workers who fled into the bush along with the populations of Pibor and Lukangol before the attack, said Sarathy Rajendran, head of the group's South Sudan mission.
She similarly said that the town of Pibor is secure now, though the situation there remains fluid.
The people who fled remain scattered, and the United Nations is working on a plan for how to distribute humanitarian aid, Hermann said.
