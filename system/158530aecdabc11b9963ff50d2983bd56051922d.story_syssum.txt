The owner of country music's Grand Ole Opry sued the U.S. government on Monday, accusing two federal agencies of turning the 2010 flood that struck Nashville into a man-made catastrophe.
The Corps of Engineers referred questions about the lawsuit to the U.S. attorney's office in Nashville, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In a January 2011 report on the disaster, the Weather Service found that the Corps was forced to increase the flow of water from a dam on the Cumberland River amid record rainfalls over Nashville and the surrounding region on May 2.
But forecasters weren't told about the additional releases, and the Cumberland passed its predicted crest of 41.9 feet within two hours of their advisory, the report stated.
