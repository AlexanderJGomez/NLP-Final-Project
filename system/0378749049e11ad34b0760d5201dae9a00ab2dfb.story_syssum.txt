What began as an experiment in making a public space into a shared space has become a global art project, with more than 400 "Before I die" walls in 60 countries and 25 languages.
"Our public spaces are our shared spaces, and they have a lot of potential to offer us a more valuable and meaningful kind of life.
Many of the walls disappear a few months after they're "born," just like Chang's did, after someone bought the building and renovated it.
In honor of the release of the first book celebrating Before I die's global footprint, we asked Chang to reflect upon the most common themes expressed in the walls.
"Love and be loved" is one of the most common responses on walls around the world, Chang said.
She's also seen budding romance on walls.
"Ever since, traveling has been my school and my therapy.
But putting others ahead of ourselves can be a tall order for some, especially in an era of instant gratification.
"I'll never forget a middle school art teacher who encouraged me when I was full of self-doubt, a neighbor who fixed my bike pedal or a stranger who went out of his way to return my lost bag.
Each week, my dad sends me endearing stories that only enhance the inspiring mythology of our lives."
