Singer Rihanna, the girlfriend Brown is accused of attacking, wants the case resolved without a trial, her lawyer said.
If he is convicted, the sentence could range from probation to four years and eight months in prison, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office has said.
The goal is "to see if it can be resolved prior to the preliminary hearing and prior to trial," Etra said.
He said it was "premature to speculate" what Rihanna might consider a fair plea deal for Brown.
The next court hearing in the case is set for April 29.
