(CNN) -- A New Zealand gas station owner who became an overnight millionaire after a banking error, and later an international fugitive, has pleaded guilty to seven counts of theft.
In April of that year, Gao applied for overdraft financing for the gas station he co-owned with his mother in Rotorua, New Zealand, according to court records.
After two and a half years on the run, Gao was arrested in Hong Kong in September 2011, and extradited to New Zealand in December.
Westpac, the Australian bank, recovered about $2.9 million from the couple's New Zealand accounts, but has yet to recoup the remaining $3.8 million.
The bank had no comment.
