To conform to the traditional stereotype of a model you need to be skinny, stunning and have legs that go on forever, right?
In 1999, Modiselle was just 13 years old when she was first approached to do a five-page shoot for a youth magazine aiming to showcase how the African fashion landscape would change with the turn of the millennium.
Yet it wouldn't be until she finished her high school education and entered college (at the behest of her mother) that Modiselle found herself in front of a camera again.
But Modiselle doesn't just have to live with the unspoken threat of discrimination hanging in the air.
And now you have to fit into a world where, you're told: this is black, this is white and you're in a country that is constantly fighting these aspects.
(My) plan for the future is just to grow myself as a brand and as an entity: to touch the world in different places and to be able to be a huge representative for Africa."
