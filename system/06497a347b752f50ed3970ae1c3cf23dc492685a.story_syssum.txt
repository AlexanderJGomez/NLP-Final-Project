(CNN) -- An Iraqi official condemned Friday the decision by a U.S. jury not to sentence a U.S. soldier to death.
He was the last of five soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division convicted in the crimes and the cover-up that followed.
Green was tried in civilian court because he had been discharged from the Army by the time his crimes came to light.
Bryan Howard received sentences ranging from 27 months to 110 years, with the possibility of parole in 10 years in the most severe cases.
Doug Green, Steven's brother, said he was grateful his brother's life was spared.
Everybody is going to need some healing."
The murders of members of the al-Janabi family occurred in 2006 near Yusufiya, about 20 miles south of Baghdad.
