(CNN) -- California Rep. Maxine Waters is pressing the House ethics panel to set her trial date before the midterm elections in November.
According to Waters' 2008 financial disclosure statement -- as mentioned in the report -- her husband had two investments in OneUnited at the time of the meeting.
"I have not violated any House rules," she said in a statement Monday.
Waters has asked The Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to make public the formal charges against her.
Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-New York, is also facing a possible ethics committee trial.
The growing likelihood of trials for Waters and Rangel also adds the explosive element of race to the political equation.
Both representatives are leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus, and OneUnited Bank is one of the largest minority-owned banks in America.
