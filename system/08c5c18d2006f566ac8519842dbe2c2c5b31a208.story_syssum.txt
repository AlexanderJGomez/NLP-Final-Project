No longer contained in northern Germany, the outbreak has killed at least two people in the western part of the country.
But figures coming in from local authorities and hospitals made clear many more people are believed to be infected.
Sweden's health ministry said there have been 39 confirmed cases of people sickened by E. coli in Sweden, 16 of which are being investigated for complications caused by HUS.
While authorities in Germany worked to contain and respond to the outbreak, the specific cause remained unclear.
European Union spokeswoman Pia Ahrenkilde-Hansen told CNN that German authorities were examining cucumber batches from the Spanish cities of Almeria and Malaga as potential sources of infection.
we're not ruling out using all necessary measures to make sure there's compensation for the (economic) damage," she wrote.
"From the first day, the government launched a diplomatic offensive to prevent the linking of this health crisis with our products."
The Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition said two Spanish companies producing cucumbers may be involved in the outbreak.
