The man who died Monday at the age of 82 was as much an icon as some of the celebrities he dressed over the years.
Sarah Jessica Parker's Carrie Bradshaw helped put Manolo Blahnik shoes on the map and had viewers trying to emulate some of her looks.
You ... you call him Oscar?"
"I said to Mr. De la Renta, please let me use scarlet embroidery thread and splash your name across the back," the actress told Vanity Fair.
Whether it's Nicki Minaj musing about being "front row at Oscar de la Renta" or Kanye West's clever word play -- "especially if she can't get that dress from Oscar de la Renta they wouldn't rent her" -- many artists used his name to express the good life.
His fashions were a favorite of this country's first ladies from Jacqueline Kennedy to Hillary Clinton, and he continued to draw the rich and powerful even in his later years.
"You're also blithely unaware of the fact that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns," the tough-as-nails Priestly says.
His jeans were hot in the 1980s, and his brand encompasses everything from fragrance to sleepwear.
Though his name often showed up in the media for designing Amal Clooney's wedding gown or dressing stars on the red carpet, de la Renta's style was also available to the much less famous.
