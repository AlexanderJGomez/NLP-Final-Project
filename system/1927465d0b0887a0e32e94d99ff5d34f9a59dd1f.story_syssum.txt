(CNN) -- A California educator who authorities say is the person accused in a YouTube video of sexual abuse by a former student was charged Monday with 16 felony counts of child sex abuse, the Riverside County District Attorney's Office said.
But John Hall, a spokesman for the district attorney's office, said there is no statute of limitations on the most serious charge -- aggravated sexual assault on a child under 14.
She hopes justice is done in the criminal case and that Cardosa admits to what she's done, which she already admitted to in the phone call -- that she ruined her childhood."
The video features the alleged victim on camera and what is said to be the teacher's voice on a phone conversation.
"She made me believe that she was my only friend, and that I could trust her."
CNN first learned of Monday's charges on Twitter.
