(CNN) -- The patient slammed his fist on the table in Dr. Otis Brawley's office.
"However, cancers are heterogeneous and can follow multiple paths, not all of which progress to metastases and death."
They took samples of their tumors and decided what breast cancer looks like, what lung cancer looks like, etc.
The problem, Brawley says, is that they're still comparing the samples to the cancer definition that was created more than 150 years ago.
When we do, our inclination is to act, even when the remedy turns out to be far more harmful than the disease would have been, had it run its course.
But a recent study of physicians with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs found that salaried physicians who received no income from an increased volume of services and who had limited liability concerns ordered as many heart stress tests deemed "unnecessary" as doctors in more traditional settings.
"To raise awareness and to get people to participate in screening, we have to whip up fear; we must introduce a bit of 'dis-ease' into the population," he said.
It's an issue many people have difficulty wrapping their heads around: Some patients who are diagnosed with cancer do not need to be treated, because that cancer is never going to bother them.
One was a change in the terminology doctors use to talk about cancer, especially when the cells they've found may not be dangerous.
"That tumor would just stay there: never grow, never spread."
For example, if a woman is told that her mammogram is abnormal, that diagnosis might be straightened out days or weeks later, and she might find out that she does not have cancer.
"In my experience, it's not the diagnosis of cancer which really kills people," said Ezekiel Emanuel, a former oncologist, vice provost for global initiatives and chairman of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania.
"We're starting to realize that that is not true in all cases."
