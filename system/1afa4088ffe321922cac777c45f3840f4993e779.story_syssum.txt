Holding the reins and telling the history of the town is a woman dressed in clothing of an era long past.
"This is a one-string diddley bow," Blues says as he picks up a crude, homemade instrument constructed from items you might find in any kitchen.

For the past 14 years, Blues has had a one-man-band blues show that he performs in the shadow of the Old Torpedo Factory, located on the boardwalk in the heart of Old Town.

"This idea of live music, that when they bring their kids by and they come across a person performing outdoors without a microphone, that this is something of value that we should treasure, and that we should support."
Blues says he will play on the street "as long as there are people here to stop and listen."
