"I truly believe Brittany had a major purpose in this life," Cathy Reidy of New York wrote in the guest book on Maynard's obituary on Legacy.com.
Maggie Karner, a woman with the same brain cancer, posted an October 29 open letter to Maynard on YouTube.
In an article published October 10 on the Federalist website, Karner wrote that Maynard may have wanted to control when she died but "As for my cancer journey, circumstances out of my control are not the worst thing that can happen to me.
Maynard addressed the issue of choice last month in an opinion piece written for CNN.
The pretty, just-married 29-year-old had turned herself into the newest face identified with the assisted suicide movement by talking openly about her plans to die.
For instance, Pamela Couvrette, who has a painful disease, posted an open letter to Maynard on October 12 on her blog, Guarding the Deposit.
"They refuse to accept what's really going on, and want to believe their loved one is still in there (they're not), and that perhaps by some miracle they will return to perfect health."
In the Twitterverse, two posters were less ambivalent: "Any way you look at it, suicide is wrong because it does not end suffering, it ends hope," tweeted ZEFFeREEN .
Lisa Moreno of Fayetteville, North Carolina, posted a goodbye to Maynard on her obit guest book page.
