In their natural state, the barrier islands that line about half of the U.S. coast, including most of the region affected by Sandy, are mobile and change constantly in response to wind, waves, tides and sea level.
In fact, these islands owe their very existence to storms and the long-term rise in sea level of the past several thousand years.
While a failed dune in a coastal community makes it more exposed to the next storm, dune failure can make an undeveloped barrier island stronger by adding elevation to its core.
On a developed shore, this excavation of the roads is absolutely necessary to regain the dunes that are the first line of defense.
Although Sandy and the 1962 storm differ in their details, 50 years of sea-level rise certainly allowed water to reach areas that would not have been reached otherwise.
What we know about storms, sea-level rise and barrier island response can be applied to redevelopment of the New Jersey coast.
Doing nothing other than rebuilding is an easy choice and least expensive in the near-term, unless the next "superstorm" comes next year, or even this winter.
This requires identifying which areas can adapt best, prioritizing which will receive the most protection and which will receive the least, or even none.
