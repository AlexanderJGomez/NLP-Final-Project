In several public statements, with one as recent as Monday, Sony has said the persistent downtime was due to an "external intrusion," but has not provided a target date for when services will return.
"As we previously noted, this is a time intensive process, and we're working to get them back online quickly."
Sony released a statement on Thursday saying, "It may be a full day or two before we're able to get the service completely back up and running."
The timing is especially frustrating because it comes on the heels of three blockbuster launches for the PlayStation 3.
All these launched in the United States on Tuesday, one day before the outage.
