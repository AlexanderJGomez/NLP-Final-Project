Or maybe the spy agency, under fire for eavesdropping on Americans, had accidentally blurted a secret of its own -- a coded, classified message not meant for public eyes.
Turns out the nonsensical tweet was a coded recruiting pitch by the NSA, which is seeking code breakers to help decipher encrypted messages from potential terrorists.
When contacted by CNN, NSA spokeswoman Marci Green Miller said the Twitter account is run by the NSA recruitment office, which will post coded tweets each Monday for the rest of the month.
But the agency seems eager to recruit smart people -- even, perhaps, those with minor arrest records.
Matthew Aid, who wrote a book about the NSA , told CNN last year that NSA hackers focus on foreign militaries, governments and corporations, and are protected by multiple levels of secrecy.
Documents leaked by Snowden showed the NSA ran a secret surveillance program to intercept Americans' phone calls and Internet messages.
