Knowing next to nothing about what they might encounter in the dark recesses of the hotel, Indian Army commandos decided to go back in -- and were met by terrorists firing mercilessly, throwing  grenades and continuously switching positions.
When the gunfire stopped, commandos -- known as the Black Cats -- entered the room and freed all 200 hostages.
They had no idea what kind of people they would encounter, what kind of weapons might be pointed at them, and whether they might be blown up by explosives.
At that point we also came under fire.
The attackers had a clear advantage, commandos said, because it was apparent from their movements they knew the hotel's layout.
At one point, commandos believed some of the terrorists were hiding on the eighth floor.
They decided to flush out the terrorists by blocking entry and exit routes.
"Within the first exchanges of fire, we could have got those terrorists -- but there was so many hotel guests -- there were bodies all over and blood all over.
In trying to rescue hostages and trapped civilians, commandos had to convince guests they were there to help, not terrorists trying to trick them, Indian Army Lt. Gen. Noble Thamburaj said.
CNN-IBN said that attacks at the Taj Mahal Hotel were well under way at 9:30 p.m. Wednesday, but unnamed sources said the commandos were not given the go-ahead to take part in the rescue until midnight.
While local police and other officers were at the scene, the sources said, the commandos and army special force units are the only ones equipped and trained to rescue hostages.
