Holly Robinson Peete: I learned about a subset of the population that I never thought of before, which are the children of incarcerated parents.
Something so simple you would think wouldn't be a big deal, but to a child who's lost their parent to incarceration, they watch these videos over and over again.
I think about watching my father's video.
Oftentimes they are just looked at as Mommy or Daddy.
So I said, "We've got to get in there."
It ... was a lot of pressure; I wanted it to go well.
And they really didn't strike me as people who had done anything except that they were dads in that moment and they wanted to get messages to their children.
Cooper: It's an incredibly intimate act, the making of these videos.
I felt like I was doing something not necessarily for the inmates, but for their children.
Peete: We walked into the cell block, and ... two gentlemen that came out looked at me.
... (laughs) Even in jail somebody has a script for you, Anderson.
And for no other reason than it is their calling, it is something they are drawn to.
