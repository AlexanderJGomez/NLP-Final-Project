So far, the public has heard more details of the case than many anticipated.
One is that Bo has rejected all allegations so far, and said he "unwillingly" accepted the charge when he was being questioned by the central disciplinary commission investigation team.
Because he did not go too far to condemn other leaders or reveal some other problems; this is probably what worried some of the leadership the most.
But that means even the leadership can't rely too much on the promises or deals made by Bo.
If you look at September 28 when they arrested him and expelled him from the Communist Party -- there were about six or seven charges, including obstruction of justice and womanizing and, probably most importantly, during the investigation of the murder of Neil Heywood they allegedly found some other criminal activities.
He wants to be a top leader, or the top leader.
If it's too lenient they'll receive other serious criticism so it's really a no-win situation for the leadership.
Some people who previously really hated him now tend to forget all the awful things he allegedly did.
He was very respectful, reasonable, had a human touch, he cared about Dalian, he cared about its people.
Also, his defense lawyer did an excellent job to use very clear language to undermine a lot of the accusations.
If you look at the pictures before her arrest and in the court, it looks like there's a problem.
Li: The Bo case has revealed the fundamental flaws of the political system and the widespread phenomenon of corruption and power abuse.
That strategy, although it's rational, will probably not resonate very well -- you leave some potential problems for the future as they fail to use the case to consolidate and uplift public confidence in the legal system.
The worst is probably the life sentence, and the most lenient probably 15 years.
