AEG Live called LePerruque as a witness in an effort to show jurors that Jackson was a secretive drug addict, making it impossible for its executives to know his life was in danger as he prepared for his comeback tour.
Jackson called him between 20 and 30 times from his hotel room "in the middle of the night," LePerruque testified.
He would go to Jackson's room many of those nights to check to make sure he was alright, he said.
The security chief said he would sometimes notice empty wine bottles from the hotel room's minibar, but he never saw drugs.
LePerruque said he never confronted Jackson about his drug use because he "didn't want to put him on the defensive."
The incidents of slurred speech and incoherent late night phone calls did not happen over the entire time LePerruque worked with Jackson, he said.
"He said that as an artist he always had a tune in his head, different melodies, and he wasn't able to stop it," La Perruque said.
The incidents in which Jackson appeared to be under the influence of alcohol and drugs became more frequent after the broadcast of a documentary based on Martin Bashir's extensive interviews with him.
If he suspected he was molesting children he would be the first to slap handcuffs on him, he said.
The wrongful death trial begins its 15th week in a Los Angeles courtroom Monday.
