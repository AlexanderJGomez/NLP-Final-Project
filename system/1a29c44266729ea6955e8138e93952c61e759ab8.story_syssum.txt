These treatments (while standard for this type of cancer) were so barbaric and horrifying I would not wish them on my worst enemy.
By talking to many other parents who have lost children to childhood cancer, I have come to understand that this pain will last until I am gone.
I do this in hopes that greater awareness will lead to desperately needed funding and research, so children can receive more humane treatments and have a better chance of survival, with fewer future complications.
My dream was to see as much gold in September for Childhood Cancer Awareness Month as there is pink in October for Breast Cancer Awareness Month.
I started reaching out to officials at bridges, buildings and landmarks across the United States, asking that they light gold in September to help increase awareness.
Please display gold this September to help shed light on the monster that afflicts so many of our children.
But last September, I returned to see many of the landmarks we had crossed and passed by so often illuminated with gold lights.
