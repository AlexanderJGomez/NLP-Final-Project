Electronics makers use CES as a platform to show the types of products they plan to release in the coming year.
But with some of the largest players in today's consumer electronics industry shunning CES, the trade show's impact may be waning.

Vimeo CEO Dae Mellencamp said in an interview at the company's New York headquarters that CES has emerged as an important venue for her company and others like it.
"It's the only trade show I attend all year," she said.
