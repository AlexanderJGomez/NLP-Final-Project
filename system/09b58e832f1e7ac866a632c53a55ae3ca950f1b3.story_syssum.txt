Turmoil between the two sides is worrisome to the West because a power vacuum in Yemen could benefit al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a terrorist organization based in Yemen that took credit for the attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris; it also tried to blow up a plane landing in Detroit in 2009.
Houthis say Yemen's military attacked people demanding that authorities lift road closures introduced as a security measure after the presidential chief of staff was abducted in Sanaa a few days ago.
"Today's events appear to be the next stage in Houthi plans to extend their control in Yemen.
The presidential palace is controlled by the government and mountaintops surrounding the palace are held by rebels known as Houthis, a senior interior ministry official told CNN late Monday.
"He is at his place, but currently he has been surrounded by Houthi militias around his place, and they have stationed themselves at rooftops of neighboring buildings.
Houthis said their convoy had also been fired upon after leaving the talks.
Adding to the disputes, the information minister said Yemeni state TV and the state-run Saba news agency are now under the control of the Houthi political movement.
A U.S. official said the United States was monitoring the violence Monday and had sufficient military power nearby to evacuate its embassy "on short notice" if needed.
Al-Sakkaf said Monday's dispute began when the government tried to implement a security plan as it feared more abductions of key staff.
The abduction came amid increased tensions in the Arabian Peninsula country after the rise of Shiite Houthi rebels.
In September, Houthis signed a ceasefire deal with the government.
