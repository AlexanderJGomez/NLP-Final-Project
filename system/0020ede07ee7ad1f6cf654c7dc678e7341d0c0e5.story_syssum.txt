But six years on, much like the characters Vladimir and Estragon in Samuel Beckett's play "Waiting for Godot" -- a drama about the passing of time -- the wait for a second grand slam shows no sign of ending.
Her continuing search to help solve this problem and allow her to feel comfortable in her own skin has led her to appointing a support network who speak the same language.
They have all been part of her entourage since her split with British coach Nigel Sears in July, following a second-round exit at Wimbledon.
"We are also having more fun and a lot of laughs on the court as well to make it interesting, because the year gets very long," she said of her team.
In Kontic, Ivanovic may not have a wise professor on her hands as she did with Sears, yet the 32-year-old, ranked 1,635th in men's doubles, is able to offer her something that respect within the game cannot always buy -- a shared cultural identity.
"A lot of players on tour jump around with coaches, I can never understand that.
Now ranked 14th, she has been outside of the top 10 since June 2009, partly explained by her inability to reach the final four of a grand slam since that 2008 win over Dinara Safina in Paris.
According to Forbes, she was the ninth highest-paid female athlete in 2013 with total earnings of $7 million -- brought in largely thanks to lucrative sponsorship deals including Adidas, Yonex, Juice Plux and Dubai Duty Free.
"She can beat the top players, but to win a grand slam you have to win seven matches.
"I still feel like there is so much I can achieve and so many tournaments I can win," she told the Belgian.
So definitely I want to achieve what I can on the court and then focus."
