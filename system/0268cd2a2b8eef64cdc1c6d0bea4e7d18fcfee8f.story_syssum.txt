The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, which previously had banned operators from using cell phones and other portable devices, now has told employees to leave the devices at home while on duty, National Transportation Safety Board member Debbie Hersman said Monday.
Boston officials said over the weekend that the trolley operator was using his cell phone.
"The operator of the striking train was interviewed at the hospital by two detectives," said MBTA general manager Daniel Grabauskas.
Both trains were traveling westbound when one train rear-ended the second, an MBTA official said.
