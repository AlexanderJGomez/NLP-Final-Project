Regardless of the other candidates' performances in New Hampshire or even what happens in the South Carolina primary next week, Mitt Romney is extremely likely to be the Republican nominee.
The dominant political science explanation of the presidential nominating process is contained in the book, "The Party Decides" by Marty Cohen, David Karol, Hans Noel, and John Zaller.
On top of this is the effect of national media figures on TV, radio and the Internet closing ranks around the candidate most leaders in their party support.
As Ben Smith of Politico noticed, on December 14, just about all columnists on the Washington Post op-ed page, regardless of their ideologies, criticized Gingrich.
Through the end of November, Romney had 55% of all Republican endorsements and his share has only increased in December and after his slim victory over Santorum in Iowa.
How did a candidate who relatively recently supported abortion and gay rights, and who as governor passed a health reform bill remarkably similar to the president's, manage to lock up the Republican establishment's support?
But many Republican endorsers were late in deciding to go with Romney.
Still, Perry remains the only candidate besides Romney with nontrivial support from Republican elites.
If he could somehow manage to run a respectable campaign and win a substantial number of votes in South Carolina, he would be Romney's only halfway plausible threat.
