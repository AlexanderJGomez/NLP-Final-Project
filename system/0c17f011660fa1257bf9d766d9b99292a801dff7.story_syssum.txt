Although her overall cholesterol number lingered in the low to mid-200s, she figured her medication would keep it under control.
Peiffer didn't think much about her cholesterol until nine years ago, when, at age 39, she began to feel ill during a water aerobics class.
It got so bad she decided to drive home.
But because of her age, doctors never considered that she might be having heart problems; they figured she had a virus and sent her home.
Millions of Americans get a diagnosis of high cholesterol every year.
HDL, or high-density lipoprotein, is the "good" cholesterol because it helps to clear excess fats from the arteries.
In some people, improving diet and adding exercise can lower the overall number, but when lifestyle changes don't work and for people who have a genetic predisposition for high cholesterol, medication is usually prescribed.
But cardiologists say many people think that because they are taking medication, they're protected and don't need to worry about their numbers.
The National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines recommend that everyone age 20 and older get a fasting "lipoprotein profile" every five years.
If you want to avoid medication and try to achieve healthy cholesterol numbers naturally, the American Heart Association has these recommendations:
â€¢ Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables and nonfat or low-fat dairy products.
And most important, she knows her numbers: Her cholesterol is well below 200.
It could save your life."
