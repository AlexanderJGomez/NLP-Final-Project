The NASL, which collapsed in 1984, favored big names and an adaptation of the rules, while the MLS has tried to supplement home-grown talent with foreign stars such as David Beckham, capable of taking the game's reach to more fans.
Seattle first put itself forward as an MLS franchise at the league's inception in 1994 and, after several attempts, in 2007 the city was awarded a team thanks to the combined efforts of high-profile backers.
"It's the most played sport [here]," adds Greg Mockos, co-president of the Emerald City Supporters (ECS) -- the Sounders' largest fan organization.
The 2009 season was the inaugural campaign for the Sounders, and while the front office will be delighted with its on-pitch performance -- the side reached the Western Conference semifinals and won the U.S. Open Cup -- it has been the enthusiastic response of the city's soccer fans that could be providing most pleasure.
The fans were behind us and they've got their chants for individual players.
The process of attracting people inside and out of Seattle's existing soccer fanbase has come at a time when the city is still reeling from the loss of its NBA franchise (the Sonics) to Oklahoma City (now named Thunder).
"But the NBA has the best players in the world, and they're gone now from Seattle.
As the next couple of years progress, if the team gets better and I think because of management it will, then there's a whole bigger market out there."
The main thing for us is we can't be complacent on the field or off it," he said.
