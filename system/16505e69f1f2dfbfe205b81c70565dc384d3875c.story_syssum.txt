"We've recommended to both [Japan and China] that the United States is more than willing to host a trilateral where we would bring China and Japan and their foreign ministers together to discuss a range of issues," Clinton said Saturday.
"We have certainly encouraged both Japan and China to seek peaceful resolution of any disagreements that they have in this area or others."
The Chinese government cut off high-level talks with Japan on coal and increased commercial flights between the countries.
The China-Japan dispute parallels U.S. efforts to curb Chinese claims for territory in the South China Sea, out of fear the increasingly powerful Chinese military could seek to dominate Asian waters.
In addition to rich areas for fishing, the islands in the South China Sea are believed to have large oil and gas reserves and surround busy sea lanes shuttling resources for China's fast-growing economy.
