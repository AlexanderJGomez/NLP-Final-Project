Close that same fashion magazine -- or maybe ever-so-gently hurl it at the wall -- and perhaps you're left feeling slightly inadequate and envious.
Diane Von Furstenberg, or DVF as she's known, sold her first wrap dress in the 1970s.
"What was new about my wrap dress was that I did it in jersey and therefore it molded the body and it was very flattering to the body."
"Ten years ago I started again because I saw that very hip young girls were buying them in thrift shops."
While the dresses are stocked in DVF stores, they are regularly bought and sold in vintage stores and through online auction sites, such as eBay.
"They make me feel not only sexy, but successful, sophisticated and timeless," said Carolyn Yapp, a 24-year-old DVF devotee from Jamaica.
"Buying vintage wrap dresses makes them more affordable for me, yet I still get the benefit as if I were buying new due to their classic cuts and their durability."
Why did you buy it and what does it mean to you?
