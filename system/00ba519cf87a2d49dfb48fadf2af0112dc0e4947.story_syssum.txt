(CNN) -- Having established itself as Apple's top tablet competitor by going smaller and cheaper, Amazon will now go head to head with the category-defining iPad on its own turf.
The Fire comes out way ahead on this one, as is to be expected from Amazon, which has targeted customers looking for the basic features of a tablet but not willing to pay Apple's heftier price tag.
While Amazon obviously closed the gap significantly, the iPad still has a bigger screen than the Fire.
Both Apple and Amazon boast that the resolution on their tablet is so sharp that it's impossible for the human eye to discern individual pixels.
But that price gets you 250 MB of data per month -- not a lot for a device designed in large part to stream movies and other media.
When the first iPad launched, AT&T offered data plans starting at $15 per month, or $180 per year, for 250 megabytes of data.
Add the more than a half-million apps that run on mobile devices and you've got a lot from which to choose.
Amazon, of course, likes to play up the movies and books that make up its universe of content (and the sale of which make Kindle prices possible).
