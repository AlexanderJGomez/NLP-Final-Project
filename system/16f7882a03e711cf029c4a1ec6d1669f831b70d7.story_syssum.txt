Washington (CNN) -- The Sportsman Channel's promo for Sarah Palin's new reality television venture features the gun-toting politico-turned-celebrity exploring her idea of American freedom: man caves, target shooting and race cars.
Given the demographics of the Sportsman Channel, Palin's new show will likely trend Republican, said Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.
"I've been very impressed with the way she has used her notoriety and her appeal to get the average American in tune with our government," said Crystal Wright, an editor and blogger with ConservativeBlackChick.Com who has spoken favorably of Palin in the past.
The role she's had in the grassroots level in getting them engaged in the political process is a good one."
Or Arnold's (Schwarzenegger) movies hamper his political career," said Mike Opelka, director of news operations at the conservative theblaze.com.
There is also risk in celebrity politics, political experts say.
"I don't know if it necessarily helps her expand the base as it solidifies the base," said Ben Fergusson, a conservative radio host and CNN political commentator who added that independent voters may turned off by Palin's popularity.
"It may alienate others."
