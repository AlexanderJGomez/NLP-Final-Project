Robert was 15 when his brother, Edwin, left home at age 18.
Neighbors and friends would tell Robert they thought they spotted Edwin around the city.
The pitch-black, 15-by-6-foot space discovered by the owner of the apartment building houses what police described as an abandoned boiler room, where the overwhelming stench of urine and feces still hung in the chamber two days after the discovery.
Hours after his father's phone call, Robert made the nine-hour drive north to see if his long-lost brother was among the four victims.
"When I saw their names together, I knew it was my brother and his girlfriend.
When Edwin left his Philadelphia home at 18, he told Robert he was staying with his girlfriend, Tamara, and her family, Robert said.
Robert said it was Breeden who introduced Edwin to one of his alleged captors, and he believes his brother's abuse could have started soon after Edwin left home.
Last month in Philadelphia, Robert and his father met with police and were sent to a health care facility where the captives were being evaluated.
Edwin held it inches from his face, almost straining to read it, Robert said.
Edwin started talking, and then wrapped his lanky arms around his baby brother.
Police arrested Linda Ann Weston, 51, Gregory Thomas, 47, Eddie Wright, 49, and Weston's daughter, Jean McIntosh, 32, for allegedly imprisoning four mentally disabled adults in the basement boiler room.
In addition to the four captives found in the basement, authorities have located 10 other potential victims, including six children, Ramsey said.
DNA testing is being conducted to confirm paternity, but the Sanabrias believe Edwin is the father.
Edwin told his brother that one of the captives, Herbert Knowles, had seizures in the basement, so he gave him water and placed a cold rag on his head, Robert said.
"The first thing I wanted to tell him was that this was not his fault, that everybody gets tricked," he said.
