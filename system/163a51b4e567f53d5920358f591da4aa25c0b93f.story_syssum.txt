Ishant Sharma gave India early breakthroughs in the morning, Virender Sehwag and Zaheer Khan chipped in with vital wickets and Amit Mishra completed a four-wicket haul as India cantered to victory with a session to spare.
But Sehwag brought himself on just before the lunch interval and struck in his second over, luring Tamim into a wild slash and inducing the edge, Dravid completing the dismissal with a sharp catch at slip.
But that reprieve hardly proved costly as Mishra held a low return catch from Shafiul in the next over to send back the batsman.
Mishra, however, brought up victory by prising out Mushfiqur, the wicketkeeper-batsman lofting the bowler over the top, but only finding the fielder at long-off.
