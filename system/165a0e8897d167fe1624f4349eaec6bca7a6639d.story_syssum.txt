Talabani was rushed to a Baghdad hospital Monday night in deteriorating health because of hardening of his arteries, his office told the media.
Talabani was elected president of Iraq in 2005, in the nation's first free elections in more than 50 years.
Talabani's doctor and a spokesman for the president's office said then that he was suffering from exhaustion and lung inflammation, and underwent tests they described as precautionary.
Two months later, Talabani left for medical tests and to lose weight, his office said.
