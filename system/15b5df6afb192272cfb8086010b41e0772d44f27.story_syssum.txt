Rick Perry signed the voter ID measure into law last year, but it had yet not gone into effect because the federal Voting Rights Act requires changes in Texas voting laws to be pre-cleared by the U.S. Justice Department.
The court noted the requirements will fall heavily on African-Americans and Hispanics, who make up a disproportionate percentage of the poor in Texas.
"Under the proposed law, many of those without the required voter identification would be forced to travel great distances to get one -- and some would have to pay for the documents they might need to do so," said a statement from the attorney general.
Democrats claim there is no voter fraud issue, and that the laws are designed to reduce voting by poor minorities.
The Texas law said those who are 65 or older, disabled or expect to be absent on Election Day may vote by mail without presenting identification.
