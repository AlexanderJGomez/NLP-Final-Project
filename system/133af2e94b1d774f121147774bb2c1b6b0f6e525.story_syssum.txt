The former Liverpool star struck with three minutes left of added time to deal a hammer blow to Iraq's title defense.
Into extra-time, it was Australia who looked the more likely to make the breakthrough with Sasa Ognenovski nearly scoring with a spectacular overhead kick.
Meanwhile, South Korea beat Iran 1-0 in in the later quarterfinal, again after extra-time, to set up a last-four meeting with Japan.
However, a goal from South Korean midfielder Bit Ka Ram Yoon in the 105th minute was enough to knock out the three-time champions.
