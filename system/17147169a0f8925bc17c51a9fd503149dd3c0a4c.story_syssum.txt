A series of photos of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un speaking with his staff in front of the ski resort site was released this week.
The accompanying news report from the state-run Korean Central News Agency said the young leader dropped by to get a firsthand report on the progress of construction.
"The fact that North Korea is spending exorbitant amounts of money building a ski resort while its people and even its military don't have enough to eat shows that this is just a move to advertise the image of Kim Jong Un as a leader who cares about his people," an anonymous North Korean defector told NK News, a South Korea-based media company specializing in North Korean news.
The defector also said that existing ski infrastructure in North Korea is used exclusively for military purposes, and that there's a high likelihood this will also be the case with the new resort.
