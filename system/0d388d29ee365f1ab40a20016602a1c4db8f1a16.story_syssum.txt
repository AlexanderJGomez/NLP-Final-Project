ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Consumer advocate Clark Howard revealed to listeners of his radio show on Wednesday that he has prostate cancer.
If PSA levels are up, the chances of prostate cancer rise, and Howard's levels were such that his doctor gave him PSA tests every 90 days to monitor antigen levels.
According to the American Cancer Society, one in six men will get prostate cancer in their lifetimes, and one in 35 will die of the disease.
Although its numbers are not yet complete for 2008, the organization estimated that during that year, there were about 186,320 new cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in the United States and about 28,660 men died from the disease.
"Guys put themselves in danger by not going to the doctor," he said.
