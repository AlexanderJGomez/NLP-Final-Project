1890 is also the year Carmelo Flores Laura was born, or at least, that's what his family and the Bolivian government claim.
The Bolivian man, who lives in the town of Frasquia, in the arid highlands of Bolivia, showed CNN government documents that seem to confirm he's 123 years old.
"We were skeptical from the beginning," said Stephen Coles, a professor of gerontology at the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California in Los Angeles.
Her case is the longest human lifespan that has been verified with several documents.
The Gerontology Research Group has found a document that purportedly shows Flores is actually 107 years old, and not 123.
In any case, the fact that Carmelo Flores Laura has lived for more than a century in the arid highlands of Bolivia at an altitude of more than 12,000 feet is striking.
"I was born here in the highlands," Flores told CNN in Aymara, with his son translating into Spanish.
According to family tradition, the secret to a long life is drinking the water that flows down the Illampu Glacier, located not far from Frasquia.
Before you get any ideas, the Gerontology Research Group has found that no particular diet, geographical location or kind of water makes people live longer.
They only have one detail in common: they have relatives who have lived a long time and children (who) also tend to live a long time," Coles said.
No one in the Flores family doubts that the patriarch is 123 years old.
