He obtained legendary status as Youngstown State's head football coach between 1986 and 2000, during which time he led teams to four Division I-AA national championships.
Those actions alone violate NCAA rules, but it's how Tressel acted -- and didn't act -- that really drew the ire of the NCAA, the nation's dominant intercollegiate sports organization.

Michael Slavens, the president of student government at Youngstown State for 2014-2015, says reaction to the Tressel's apparent hiring has been mixed on social media.

Youngstown State has had two presidents over the past two years, not including its current interim leader.
