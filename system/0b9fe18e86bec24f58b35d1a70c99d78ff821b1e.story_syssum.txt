LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Jay Leno says immediacy is key to his new show, and he should have plenty of it for his prime time premiere Monday, when Kanye West is a musical guest.
Leno's publicist confirmed Monday that West was still booked for the NBC show, which tapes just three hours before it airs in the eastern United States at 10 p.m.
Swift, a 19-year-old country-pop singer, was in the midst of her acceptance speech for the Best Female Video award when West rushed onstage and took her microphone.
"I spoke to her mother right after and she said the same thing my mother would've said.
When Grant told Leno "I did a bad thing," it gave Leno's "Tonight Show" a viewership bump that has been credited with solidifying his lead over rival David Letterman in the late-night ratings war.
This is just the kind of "immediacy" Leno was talking about in a call with reporters last week.
Jerry Seinfeld will also appear on Leno's premiere Monday.
