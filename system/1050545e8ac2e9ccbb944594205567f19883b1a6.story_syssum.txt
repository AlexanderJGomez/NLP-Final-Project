Given that Smith is front and center in more or less every frame of the 2 hour and 20 minute movie (and given that his performance, as a kid who hides his sadness behind a mask of surliness, is to this critic, at least a magnetic and affecting piece of acting), I hope we can all agree that Jaden Smith's presence on screen had a little something to do with the movie's success.
So where, exactly, should that piece of information lead us?
Oh, but, of course, the rap on Jaden Smith is that he's all nepotism and nothing else, that he's a kind of grouchy preteen Tori Spelling in cornrows.
He has a very quick mind, and his responses were fast and a little brusque from the start, he was toying with Letterman, putting him on the spot by giving him a lot less fake-nice, fake-sincere boilerplate chat-show banter than he wanted.
It's something that I've occasionally seen adults do, and yes, it was a little startling to see a kid this young with a movie to hawk go onto the Letterman show and assume that mock-confrontational, who's-really-in-charge-here?
Bottom line, for me: Smith was cocky as hell on Letterman, but he was also interesting.
You can almost taste the class resentment, the jealousy of folks who only wish, deep down, that they'd gotten such an opportunity themselves and now want to scrawl their rage on Jaden Smith's image like Perez Hilton going crazy with his Magic Marker.
I know that when I watched Jaden Smith in "The Karate Kid," the echoes of his father in everything from his cool, appraising glare to the nimble speed of his responses is something I enjoyed like, say, hearing that raspy echo of Bob Dylan in Jakob Dylan's voice back in the "One Headlight" days.
Now that he truly does appear to be on his way to stardom, what sort of movie should he do next?
