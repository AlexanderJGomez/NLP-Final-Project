(CNN) -- For a preview of the next big thing in video gaming, look no further than the Electronic Entertainment Expo, the splashy industry showcase that kicks off Monday in Los Angeles.
Herter said he thinks this is because of expectations for next-generation consoles being developed by Sony and Microsoft for release in 2013, and game developers' hesitation to make something that might have a short shelf life.
But in an effort to reach out to the public, many companies will be streaming events and shows throughout the four days of the conference to give fans early glimpses at new games and let them hear from developers directly.
While the Wii U was previewed in more primitive form at last year's E3, there have reportedly been some changes in how the console looks and what it can do.
Nintendo hopes to clear that up next week by demonstrating a "final" version of the system with games designed specifically for the Wii U.
"I think it is safe to assume this will be the last E3 where the current generation of consoles are talked about," said G4TV's Herter.
There also have been strong rumors of a "Monster Hunter" game for the Vita to increase support for the console in Japan.
On the software front for the Xbox 360, "Halo 4" will be showcased in a four-hour event with its new developer, 343 Industries, and the return of Master Chief as the main character.
Other exclusive, unannounced titles for the Microsoft console and Kinect are also expected -- although some franchises may be holding out for a next-generation console in a year or so.
For all the hype and excitement about E3 announcements, there are some notable titles and companies that are choosing to bypass this year's event.
But Valve does plan to attend E3, and misdirection from gaming companies has been known to occur before the show.
Gamers, what are you hoping to see at E3?
