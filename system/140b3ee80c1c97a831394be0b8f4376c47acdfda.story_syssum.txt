A crucial difference in the Flight 8501 event is that the airplane had been in constant radar contact, at least from the information provided thus far.
No matter how obvious it might appear, airplane incidents and accidents generally involve more than one factor.
On occasion, deviating around storm activity becomes a matter of determining the path that has a lower probability of turbulence encounters.
And let's not be misled by the reported request of Flight 8501 asking air traffic control for a higher altitude.
Investigators will want to know whether the pitot tubes that provide airspeed data to the cockpit computer systems froze as a result of a heater failure, similar to the circumstances with Air France Flight 447.
It is also possible that the airplane flew through heavy precipitation, flaming out both engines.
For the moment, I am keeping my fingers crossed that a search and rescue operation will find survivors.
