"Someone didn't do their homework on this case," said Democratic state Rep. Steve Holland.
When Barbour pardoned Bostick in January, the convicted DUI felon was sitting in an Oxford, Mississippi, jail cell for violating the terms of a previous DUI sentence and was awaiting formal charges from yet another drunken driving accident in October that ended in the tragic death of 18-year-old Charity Smith.
The Mississippi Parole Board and Barbour have issued statements saying they didn't know Bostick had another DUI arrest in October.
Hildon Sessums arrested Bostick twice over a span of a year for DUI.
For the third DUI, Bostick had been sentenced in March 2010 to a year of house arrest and four years in Mississippi's drug court program, an intense drug-and-alcohol-abuse treatment program with strict guidelines that convicted felons like Bostick must follow.
About a week later, on October 7, Bostick was driving under the influence again, according to the Mississippi Highway Patrol.
Because his third DUI was pardoned, a conviction in the latest DUI case would technically be his third offense, but that would still make it a felony in Mississippi.
Bosticks' pardon application packet sent from the Parole Board to the governor's office is filled with references to the "expedited investigation into the circumstances surrounding Bostick's crime," meaning his third DUI from 2009.
Barbour took the Parole Board's recommendation into consideration, and he wasn't aware of the subsequent charges," she said.
She struggles to understand how state officials could not have known that the man involved in her daughter's violent crash was the same Harry Bostick who had petitioned for a pardon.
Linda Smith described her daughter as an artist with a big heart, and she proudly talked about the powerful emotions she feels holding a collection of her daughter's paintings.
