London, England (CNN) -- Whether in the form of personal history or political biography, Jung Chang has spent her writerly life telling the story of China's tumultuous recent past.
CNN caught up with Chang, who currently lives in London, and asked her about China and why it's so important to remember the past.
I started writing the book after my mother told me the stories of her life and my grandmother's life.
I, myself, when I started writing the book in the early 1990s felt I didn't know all that much.
What happened under Mao affected so many people's lives, and that sort of agony and that terrifying past has not been properly processed in people's memories.
Hong Kong is still largely separate from mainland China, which is wonderful from my point of view as a writer.
People are under the impression that China is what it is today because Mao had laid the foundation.
Of course now there is a dramatic improvement in people's lives, in all aspects, not only material but in terms of personal freedom, the freedom of travel and lots of other personal freedoms.
JC: If there isn't anything dramatic happening, I think the country will probably go on as it is for a very long time.
From my point of view as a writer, I hope the country will find a way to talk about the past in an honest way -- to debate about the past without inhibition.
I guess I miss the whole place, the people who have been through so much and the country, which is so old and yet so young and energetic.
