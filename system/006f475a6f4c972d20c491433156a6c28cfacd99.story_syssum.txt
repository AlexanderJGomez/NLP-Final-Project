In a letter from earlier this month that Minard shared with CNN, an administrator at Southwestern Christian University noted that he'd been told of Minard's same-sex marriage and saw pictures of it posted to Facebook.
Such a union is in apparent conflict with the "lifestyle covenant" of the university "that all students must agree and sign," he added.
"I'm trying to figure out how and where I can graduate," she told CNN, noting that she'll have to start paying off her loans at the end of next year unless things change.
The latter value includes "building a Christ-centered community," "honoring our Pentecostal Holiness heritage" and "respecting diversity and various Christian backgrounds."
They started out as friends, and romance blossomed over time.
Yet Minard feels that she's in the right place in her own spiritual journey.
"I had questions, but I worked through those questions," she said.
