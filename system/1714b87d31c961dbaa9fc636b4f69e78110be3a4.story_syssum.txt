Washington (CNN) -- They're not exactly gym buddies, but a personal trainer in Poland can now say he worked out with the President of the United States.
He said when he first saw the roughly 10 agents at the gym, he didn't think he would be allowed in.
Comments online ran the gamut, as some Twitter users knocked the weight of the President's dumbbells while others cheered him for staying active.
First lady Michelle Obama has pushed Americans to get in shape and is working to end childhood obesity by encouraging kids to get active through her "Let's Move" campaign, which she launched in 2010.
It shows Obama calmly perusing the rack of free weights, which he used to lunge and lift and perform an intense set of curls.
"For me, this gym tape is almost ... no different than (White House photographer) Pete Souza's photo of the first lady and the President touching heads in the freight elevator on Inauguration Day," Chaudhary said.
