Despite his assurances, how did Ebola spread from one patient to another inside the United States?
But faced with his biggest challenge -- the current Ebola outbreak -- some are questioning if his experience and leadership style are enough to stop the virus from spreading in the United States.
And last week, a nurse who cared for that man was confirmed to have Ebola.
"Difficult taking anything (the CDC and) Frieden say seriously," conservative radio host Tammy Bruce said on Twitter, citing low confidence in what she sees as lies or guessing on the issue.
Zenei Cortez, a nurse and vice president of the group, told CNN's Jake Tapper that in cases such as this, the nurses always get blamed unfairly.
Frieden on Monday said state and federal health officials are re-examining the protocols, including the removal of protective gear after contact with an Ebola patient and if it might be helpful to spray virus-killing solution on workers as they leave an isolation unit.
Reliance on data can ensure that plans work out as they were designed to, he said.
When Frieden arrived in New York as health commissioner, there were about a thousand cases of TB in the city, Bassett recalled.
The impact of Frieden's work in India helped about half a million people, so "that's not a strange answer from him because he's very interested in numbers.
Frieden has a blog on the CDC website, which mostly consists of news articles and thoughts from the director.
"As a registered nurse, I'm here to tell you that I am losing confidence in your 'expertise'!"
If the director is interested in hearing suggestions, they are piling up from other health care professionals and members of the public interested enough about the Ebola outbreak to post a message on his blog.
It's risky.
