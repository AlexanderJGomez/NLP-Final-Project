Braydon Nichols asked that the world not forget his father, an Army officer who died when the helicopter he and other soldiers were in was downed in Afghanistan.
This week, "Dennis" wrote that he keeps on his computer a picture that CNN published of Braydon and his father wearing matching military uniforms.
Those notes mean a lot to Braydon, his uncle Monte Nichols said.
It's been incredible for the whole family to know that people do care," Nichols told CNN this week.
A generous person in Hershey, Pennsylvania, is paying for the boy and his mother Jessica Nichols to fly to the city, tour a chocolate factory and have a fun weekend.
Their short, spiky blonde hair was styled the same.
After CNN's story appeared, and donations poured in to a college trust fund for Braydon, another group of soldiers and retired military members went to work to try to figure out what they could do.
But five families who lost loved ones on the helicopter were Army and not in Special Operations, McLeary said.
The foundation, which is funded by individual and corporate donations, worked with other charities to help pay for hotels for relatives who wanted to attend memorials.
The organization's trained counselors work with each child in its program, checking in with them shortly after a death to offer professional counseling and anything else the family needs.
If Braydon's first wish was that people never forget his dad, Monte Nichols said, his second is that no one forgets kids like him.
