Bellefonte, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Matt Sandusky, one of six adopted children of Jerry Sandusky, said through his attorney Thursday that he was sexually abused by the former Penn State assistant football coach, adding that he had been prepared to testify against him in a high-profile child rape case.
After a week of testimony, jurors will have to decide without having heard from the former Penn State defensive coordinator on the witness stand.
"The great thing about conspiracy theories is you just let them go on and on, until they collapse under their own weight," he said.
McGettigan described the former coach as a pedophile who systematically preyed on his victims using a charity he founded for troubled children, identifying and repeatedly abusing young boys in his care.
Prosecutors dropped one of the original 52 counts earlier this week because the statute on which that charge was based wasn't in effect on the date of the alleged incident.
On Wednesday, the defense called Dr. Jonathan Dranov, an acquaintance of McQueary's, who told jurors that the former assistant coach told him he heard "sexual sounds" and saw the boy in the shower when an arm reached around him but, did not actually see a sexual encounter.
Jurors on Thursday told the judge they'd like to review testimony by McQueary and Dranov.
"Matt went into the shower, and then me and Jerry came in ... he started pumping his hand full of soap, like he was going to throw it.
According to several of the alleged victims, Jerry Sandusky would often use shower "soap fights" as a prelude to inappropriate sexual contact.
"He had the strength and the courage to stay loyal to us even when we weren't sure what would happen," Sandusky wrote.
Weaver did not testify in Sandusky's trial, but did file a civil action against the former coach.
"When he found out there were others, he was in real misery," Hamilton said, adding Sandusky tried to adopt Weaver.
