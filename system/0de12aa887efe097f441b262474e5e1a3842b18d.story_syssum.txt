"The challenges of the 8th Special Operations Squadron's demanding mission require new leadership to maintain the highest levels of precision and to reliably support the ground forces which count on the 8th SOS to safely accomplish their missions," Slife said in a statement, without providing details.
Slife said the new squadron commander has extensive history in the Osprey program.
In late 2000, the Marine Corps grounded the Osprey fleet after two more crashes: one in Arizona that killed four crew members and 15 passengers and another in North Carolina that killed the crew.
The Marines deployed them in Iraq in 2007 after 18 years and $20 billion in development.
