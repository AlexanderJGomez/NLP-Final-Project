(CNN) -- Visitors to the Tate Modern gallery in London on Friday have been stopped from walking on a porcelain sunflower seed art installation by the maverick Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.
A spokesman for Tate Modern told CNN that the public are unlikely be allowed to interact with the exhibit again.
The sculpture by Ai -- described by some as China's "Andy Warhol" -- is the 11th commission in the internationally acclaimed Unilever Series at the gallery, an annual series kicked off in 2000 by Louise Bourgeois's spiders and mirrors.
But they hold greater significance for Ai, who spent his childhood in Xinjiang as the son of a celebrated poet exiled by the Chinese communist government during the Cultural Revolution.
I think it's a very common, very inconspicuous object, but it also has a special relationship to our daily lives ... Of course, during the cultural revolution we all knew that the Sun symbolized the leader, and sunflowers represented the people.
It became a Mecca for radical Chinese contemporary artists like Ma Liuming.
