As a teenager, Hadiya had a natural inclination to learn about different religions and was drawn to Islam because of the focus on one God as the creator.
Despite Hadiya's close and prolonged involvement with Hizb ut Tahrir, her parents remained unaware of the degree of their only daughter's involvement with a radical organization.
"When you are in a group like this, they talk about the same thing over and over again and eventually human nature will start to think it's not making a difference," she said.
After she gave birth to her youngest child, Hadiya began exploring a different path, a more moderate and spiritual approach to Islam.
Hadiya recently helped organize a movie screening in North London for more than 70 Jewish and Muslim women as part of her work with a faith-based organization called Three Faiths Forum.
