New York (CNN) -- For Angel Rojas, the daily bus ride through the streets of Brooklyn provided a respite from a hardscrabble existence juggling two low-paying jobs.
That peace was shattered Thursday evening as Rojas shuttled between jobs, hoping to make a quick stop at home to see his wife and two children.
Rojas, 39, was hit in the head and declared dead later at a hospital near where his bus trip began.
"A life needlessly lost, taken by a 14-year-old who felt it necessary to carry a gun on a city bus and shoot it."
"She never thought she would have to bury her husband and raise the children alone."
"He was a hard worker and a family man devoted to giving his family a better life," Guerrero said.
His laughter and his presence stayed with you."
