Sometime in the next year, Cook will sit down for a cup of mud with someone who has paid at least $210,000 for the privilege.
Cook has volunteered, through the online-auction site Charity Buzz, to share up to an hour of his precious time with two lucky (and deep-pocketed) winners.
The move fits in with the more open public persona Cook has adopted since replacing late Apple CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs.
"The winner cannot blog, social network, talk to press, write about, take pictures or record during the experience in any way due to security regulations," reads the auction's legal terms.
Travel and lodging for the visit, which will last between 30 minutes and an hour, are not covered.
