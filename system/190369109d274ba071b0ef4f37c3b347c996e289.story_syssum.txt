Last month, HollaBack, an international movement dedicated to "developing innovative strategies to ensure equal access to public spaces," released a hidden camera video of Shoshana Roberts walking down the streets of New York City, just minding her own business.
Threats to rape and kill her were posted across the Internet as part of an assault that seemed intent on humiliating and silencing not only Roberts, but any woman who dares to speak up against inequality and expose the truth about how women are treated in our society.
But almost before this speech could be digested, a website featuring a timer was created to count down the hours and minutes until naked images of Watson would supposedly be released.
It is happening to girls in high school, when private naked images and rape threats are viciously sent into cyberspace as revenge for their refusal to comply with the wills of the boys at school.
Imagine that there were a rash of threats targeted only at LGBT individuals, gay celebrities and gay youth under constant threat of rape and sexual violence.
It's no wonder that men and young boys become desensitized and think it's OK to objectify, harass and threaten women who challenge the sexual status quo.
It is time that we were collectively outraged -- men and women -- about the use of sexual threats online.
