(CNN) -- Five more states reported widespread flu activity during the second week of January, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, bringing the total to 40 states.
Ten children died from complications of the flu last week, bringing the pediatric death total for the season to 20.
Dr. Gil Chavez, deputy director for California's Center for Infectious Diseases, said 45 people under the age of 65 have died during the 2013-2014 flu season, which began in September.
He said that a year ago, only five deaths had been reported at this time; there were only 106 flu deaths during the entire 2012-2013 flu season.
Adult flu deaths are not required to be reported to the CDC, but the government agency must be notified of any flu deaths in children.
One of the reasons people often say they don't get the flu vaccine is because they don't get sick.
In addition to getting the vaccine, which can prevent flu -- or at least lessen symptoms, washing your hands frequently and staying home when you're sick can help you get through the flu season.
