CNN's Larry King talked Wednesday with Michael Moore, a filmmaker with deep ties to the auto industry.
In 1989, Moore became an international figure for his film, "Roger and Me," which centered on the declining auto industry in his hometown of Flint, Michigan and the ripple effect on the town's residents.
When I made that movie that year, General Motors made a profit of over $4 billion, and they were still laying off people simply to make a bit more money, the people who helped to build the company, the workers in their hometown of Flint, Michigan, they just forgot about them and took the money and ran.
Eventually, the consumer got smart and said, 'You know what, I'd like a car that gets a little better gas mileage.
At a certain point, you know, General Motors lost such a large part of the market share that there probably was a point of no return.
I'll tell you, it was hilarious just watching these CEOs there (Tuesday) and (Wednesday) testifying in Congress, saying that, you know, that the problem wasn't theirs, you know, the cars they were building.
I'll tell you, you know, I'm of mixed mind about this bailout, Larry, because I don't think these companies, with these management people, should be given a dime, because  that's just going to be money going up in smoke or off to other countries.
When Roosevelt came in and when World War II faced the country, Roosevelt said to General Motors and Ford, you're not going to build cars anymore.
They're to build cars that use little or no gasoline.
There's got to be a plan set out to find other ways to transport ourselves in other ways than using fossil fuels.
