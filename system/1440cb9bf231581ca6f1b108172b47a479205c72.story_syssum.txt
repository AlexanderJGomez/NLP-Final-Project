You might not care about the Canadian and his "beliebers," but the 20-year-old's misbehavior and run-ins with the law raise some serious questions about immigration law enforcement.
While the Obama administration deported nearly 1.6 million people in the last four years, it's unclear how many were in the country legally.

Justin Bieber has a lot of potential charges under his belt.
As with all deportations, the president has the "inherent power to choose which cases to act on," said Richard A. Boswell, immigration law professor at the University of California's Hastings College of the Law.

You get what you pay for.
