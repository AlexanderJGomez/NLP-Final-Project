At a Pentagon press briefing, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the United States supports the findings of the investigation -- that the ship was sunk by a North Korean torpedo -- but he would not say what the United States is prepared to do, if anything, militarily.
The U.S. Army is stretched thin in two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but Gates said there are other options in the case of armed conflict on the Korean peninsula.
Meanwhile, the State Department said the United States will send a clear signal to North Korea that the sinking of the warship was in violation of international norms and it must pay a price.
Asked whether the United States would consider putting North Korea back on the State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism, Crowley said it was unclear whether the ship incident would be considered an act of terrorism to meet the legal threshold for such a designation.
Senior State Department officials said that although the department's lawyers would make the final determination, the attack is not likely to be considered a terrorist attack because North and South Korea are technically at war.
They pointed to a statement issued by the White House calling the attack an "act of aggression" and "a violation of the Armistice Agreement."
