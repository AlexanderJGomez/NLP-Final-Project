The Osteens, known for their optimistic outlook on life, visited "Larry King Live" Tuesday night for a wide-ranging interview that covered President Obama, same-sex marriage, the recent outbreak of mass shootings, the state of religion in America and more.
Joel Osteen: Well, I think he's doing a great job.
King: Recent polls show 12 percent of Americans still believe Obama is a Muslim, and 35 percent say they don't know his religion, but to most of them it don't matter.
So to me, it matters when I'm making my personal decisions.
I believe he is a Christian.
Joel Osteen: It's a living translation of the Bible, which is an easy version to read.
King: Supposing there were more states that had it.
Joel Osteen: I think that, again, it's best for a male and a female.
I know a lot of people raised by single parents.
King: In the new issue of Newsweek, the lead story by Jon Meacham is "The Decline and Fall of Christian America."
King: The Newsweek article quotes our Albert Mohler Jr. And he's president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary.
... America is more diverse than it was 50 years ago.
... And I'm sure I'm an optimistic by nature.
There are evil forces that, unfortunately, we can give into.
Victoria Osteen: Oh, absolutely.
King: We've had a mass depression in this country, recession.
... You don't have anything to live for.
You can be just one night from getting the break you need, getting the job you want.
And as hard as it is, we'll just try to encourage people that death is just a separation.
So I believe that God can give you a strength and a new beginning.
And I believe that our spirit's on the inside.
