So, a major part of the big rollout was some new, updated clothes.
You can't just throw this guy in a car and drive him down to Old Navy.

While Ronald won't actually have his own personal Twitter handle, he has been authorized to use his full name as a hashtag, marking the first time he's taken an active part in the company's social media strategy.
