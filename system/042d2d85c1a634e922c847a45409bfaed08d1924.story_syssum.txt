Wounded survivors of Monday's shooting are eligible for treatment at a U.S. military' hospital, just as if they were soldiers wounded in war.
Twelve victims -- and the suspected shooter -- died as a result of Monday morning's rampage at the headquarters for the Naval Sea Systems Command, officials said.
Jirus told CNN he was standing in an alley at the bottom of a fire escape supervising the evacuation of Building 197 when a worker from a nearby maintenance building approached him.
Three other shooting victims who were flown to MedStar Washington Hospital Center are expected to survive, hospital Chief Medical Officer Dr. Janis Orlowski told reporters about three hours after the attack began around 8:20 a.m. Monday.
The two other victims at MedStar Washington Hospital Center were women, including one shot in the shoulder and the other with a head wound, Orlowski said.
The other woman suffered a "significant wound" to her hand and head, but the bullet didn't actually penetrate her skull, she said.
The three patients were each alert when they arrived at the hospital and they sometimes talked about the shooting, Orlowski said.
I also got to talk to the husband of the second victim, who is in surgery right now.
Jacqueline Alston said she has not heard from her husband, Ernest, who is a custodial worker there.
He gave two telephone numbers people can call to check on family members who may have been at the Navy Yard.
