The South Asian country has no fewer than 37 government agencies levying more than 70 unique taxes on various goods and services -- the problem is only a fraction of the population ever pays it.
While the Pakistan tax system is riddled with exemptions -- for instance, only those who earn more than $3,500 a year, just 10 million people, are subject to income tax -- NADRA says there are plenty of avenues for raising revenue in a country where those who are eligible for taxes paid an average of just $130 a year.
Pakistan's tax chief Ali Arshad Hakeem is calling for a tax amnesty with a difference -- a one-time payment with no questions asked about the past but a promise to file tax returns for the next four years.
While the proposal has yet to become law, the hope is that the new measure will bring down the country's crippling deficit and its reliance on foreign loans.
Pakistan's former chief economist, Ashfaque Hassan Khan, said the plan was unfair to those who did pay taxes and would encourage others to wait for similar amnesties in the future.
