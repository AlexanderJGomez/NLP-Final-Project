Parliamentary elections were supposed to be held first under a timetable agreed to after Egypt's army deposed Islamist President Mohamed Morsy in July following mass protests against his rule.
The country has seen months of political turmoil since its first democratically elected president, Morsy of the Muslim Brotherhood, was deposed by the military and an interim, military-backed government was installed in his place.
In a statement posted on several al Qaeda-linked websites, the same group claimed responsibility for shooting down a military helicopter in Egypt's Sinai peninsula Saturday.
Since Morsy's ouster, Egypt's political scene has become extremely polarized between the former president's Islamist supporters and those who back the military.
Mansour also said he appealed to prosecutors to review the cases of detainees held without charges from protests, including university students, to ensure that those held for no reason are released.
