(CNN)West Coast dock workers and port management have been locked in heated labor negotiations since their contract expired in July of 2014 .
The negotiators aren't the ones suffering  -- it's all of the other industries, employers and employees throughout the country who depend on goods moving in and out of the ports.
Manufacturers are shutting down shifts for lack of imported parts and losing overseas customers because goods are not being shipped, or they're resorting to air shipments that cost significantly more than traditional shipping methods.
Similarly, there will be long-term consequences for the West Coast ports as shippers and those who rely on goods moving in and out of these ports find other ways to bring their cargo into North America -- either through Canada, Mexico or through the expanded Panama Canal to the Gulf and East Coast ports.
We have called on President Barack Obama to use his bully pulpit to ramp up the urgency on these negotiations and make clear to the parties that the country is desperate for them to get a deal.
If a full shutdown does occur, we will request that the President use his full authority under the Taft-Hartley Act to force the parties back into negotiations and keep the ports open.
