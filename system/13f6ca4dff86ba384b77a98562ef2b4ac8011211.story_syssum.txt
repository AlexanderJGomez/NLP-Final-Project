NATO had invited Zardari to the conference on Tuesday, just days after the organization's secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, had suggested that the neighbor of Afghanistan would not be included because of the continued closure of Pakistan's border with Afghanistan to war supplies.
U.S. negotiators have been in Pakistan since late April, and this past weekend, Gen. John Allen, who oversees all U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan, and his Afghan counterpart were in Pakistan for discussions that included talks about the border situation.
Zardari will make a speech in Chicago and also meet with various international leaders on the margins of the summit, his office said Thursday.
"Pakistanis think that the United States is an untrustworthy ally; the Americans think that Pakistani's don't always fulfill their end of the bargain, especially when it comes to terrorism," Haqqani said.
But we will still be haunted by the remnants," he said.
