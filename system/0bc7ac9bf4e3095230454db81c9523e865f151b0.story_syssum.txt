The report, "Fatal Flaws: Barriers to Maternal Health in Peru" found that hundreds of poor, rural and indigenous pregnant women are dying because they are being denied the same health services as other women in the country.
Amnesty's report highlighted the case of Criselda, a  22-year-old indigenous woman from the country's Huancavelica Department, one of the poorest regions of the country.

Criselda's husband Fortunato said in the report: "There is no ambulance when there is an emergency.
The organization also recommends an increase in training, particularly in indigenous languages.
