Those in the hall observed a moment of silence at 5:26 p.m. -- the time Jackson was pronounced dead Thursday in Los Angeles, California.

Al Sharpton, the New York civil rights activist who became a friend of the Jackson family, urged Jackson's fans not to let critics "scandalize" a groundbreaking performer.
The Apollo had been one of the top venues for jazz, gospel and soul artists for decades before the Jacksons' breakthrough.
"Shortly after their appearance, Diana Ross took them on an NBC special that she did, and there was no looking back after that.
