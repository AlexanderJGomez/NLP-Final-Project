His message of peace and the conflict it has created with Obama administration officials have now taken Apel and his case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
At issue is whether someone previously barred from a military base may be convicted under federal law for "peacefully protesting" on a public road easement along the enclosed high-security facility.
The federal government owns and operates the base, but the state and county have held a "use easement" for more than a half-century, and they maintain the roads.
The Apels and their supporters from Pacific Life Community, a group that opposes nuclear weapons, had conducted monthly peace vigils in a special open "protest zone" created along the Pacific Coast Highway bisecting the base.
In 2010, with the ban still in effect, Apel again entered the protest zone on repeated occasions, was told to leave, and was then escorted off the property.
"When an easement goes towards a public road, that easement includes the right to use the public road for speech activities," he said.
They want the benefits of having an easement there, in the sense that the state is responsible for maintaining the road, the state is liable for any harms on the road, and the state enforces crimes on the road.
Chief Justice John Roberts agreed: "It's been ceded by the United States for the convenience of the traveling public.
One of the arguments that the government makes is, look, what the military wants to do here is something very sensible.
It keeps tight what it needs to keep tight, but it allows to be more open areas that it doesn't have an interest in securing entirely.
"They're systematically trying to keep me out there, but I'm not going away."
