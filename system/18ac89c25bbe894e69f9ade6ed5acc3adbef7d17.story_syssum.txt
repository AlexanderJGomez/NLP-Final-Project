But fans of the sci-fi/horror franchise, which sputtered out with 1997's "Alien: Resurrection," are still eager to see what filmmaker Neill Blomkamp can do with the material.
Sure, someone could make a great "Alien" movie without her.
Weaver also has a role in "Chappie" and has gushed about Blomkamp's talent, fueling speculation that the two will work together again.
We're not saying Blomkamp should replace them with something totally different.
The "Alien" movies have generated suspense largely through the claustrophobic feel of humans trapped in enclosed spaces with deadly critters who might pop out at any moment.
And a rumored "Prometheus" sequel, if it ever happens, is expected to veer even further from the "Alien" mythology.
We hope.
