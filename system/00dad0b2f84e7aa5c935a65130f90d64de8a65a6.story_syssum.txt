Isabella dethroned Emma as the top name for girls born last year, according to the Social Security Administration's annual list of most popular baby names, released Saturday.
And as in years past, the influence of pop culture is reflected in the names picked for newborns.
As always, religious names retained their popularity -- even if some were somewhat unconventional.
Among the popular names are Nevaeh (heaven spelled backward) for girls, and Messiah for boys.
