Once criticized for shying away from the topic of race early on in his presidency, Obama has recently taken a more active role in sharing how his personal experiences help him to empathize with all kinds of people affected by the recent protests on racial tensions -- from protesters, to victims, to law enforcement officers, to families, and most importantly, to black youth.
According the President, those are small prices to pay in order to achieve the larger goal of ending racial tensions in America.
As he noted in the first half of his interview, teased Sunday, the clear video evidence available in the chokehold death of Eric Garner, a black man, in Staten Island in July has helped the broader public come to believe there are racial inequalities in the criminal justice system in a way the shooting death of Michael Brown, also black, in Ferguson, Missouri, in August, did not.
The President will be interviewed by both Univision and Telemundo on Tuesday, both of which are networks that target primarily Latino audiences.
