(CNN) -- Uncertainty over the fate of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was further compounded Saturday by reports that two men whose names matched those on the passenger manifest had reported their passports stolen.
On Saturday, Italian police visited the home of the parents of Luigi Maraldi, the man whose name appeared on the manifest, to inform them about the missing flight, said a police official in Cesena, in northern Italy.
A law enforcement official Saturday told CNN that various U.S. government agencies were briefed about the passports.
"They will be positioned to offer U.S. assistance," the NTSB said of the team, which also includes technical advisers from Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration.
CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director, was told by sources at Interpol, which keeps a database of lost or stolen travel documents, that the stolen Italian passport was in the agency's database.
So, it's a great concern when people use false documents to board international aircraft."
A U.S. intelligence official said authorities had established "no nexus to terrorism yet although that's by no means definitive.
But that's why you have the various checklists to check against and had they been identified as stolen passports ... there was a way to flag them in advance.
"American citizens have to have visas ... and you can't get on board the plane without showing the visa," she explained.
There are a lot of questions about these passports because the destination was Beijing."
The plane was cruising during what experts consider to be the safest part of the journey when it vanished.
