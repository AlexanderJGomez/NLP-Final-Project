WASHINGTON (CNN) -- When Washington manicurist Lidia Schaefer returned to her native village in Ethiopia, she was troubled by what she saw: children walking three hours each way to attend classes held not in a school, but under a tree.
For Schaefer, it was simply a matter of doing what felt right.
Born in Feres Mai, a large village in northern Ethiopia, Schaefer moved to the United States in the mid-1970s when civil war broke out at home.
The decision was made to build a secondary school, since the nearest one was more than 18 miles away.
Her clients and co-workers rallied to help, holding raffles and making contributions.
But Schaefer saw nothing remarkable about her decision.
When she went back for the dedication, Schaefer was honored with an elaborate procession through the village.
Though she'd hoped to name the school in memory of Medhine, the government -- which runs the school -- instead named it the Lidia Secondary School, telling Schaefer, "We want it to be your name so that more people [will] be like you."
When Ethiopian communities around the United States heard about what she'd been able to achieve, they launched an effort to build more schools in her region of northern Ethiopia.
"They need computers so they can talk to the whole world," she says.
