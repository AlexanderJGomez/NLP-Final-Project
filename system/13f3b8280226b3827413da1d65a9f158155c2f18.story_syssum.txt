On Monday, the palace announced that the couple is expecting a baby, though the Duchess of Cambridge had been admitted to hospital with severe morning sickness.
Both were studying art history when they met, but Catherine is said to have played a key role in encouraging the prince to switch to a degree in Geography in his second year.
Their relationship attracted intense media interest and the following year her lawyers filed their first official complaint about media intrusion.
The proposal never came and one month later, "Kate and Will" were back in headlines as it emerged that their four-year relationship was over.
Catherine's mother is a former air stewardess and her father worked as a pilot before they set up their own business.
However, it wasn't until October, 2010 that William asked for Catherine's hand in marriage in a remote hut in a wildlife reserve on the slopes of Mount Kenya, Africa's second highest peak.
Wedding fever gripped the UK as royal-watchers and the general public speculated for months about what Catherine would wear, her hair and the scale of the event in a country entrenched in austerity measures.
The latter was marred by controversy over a decision by a French magazine to publish images of the duchess sunbathing topless while on a private holiday with William in France.
Last year, Commonwealth leaders agreed to change British succession laws to allow a female to take the throne ahead of a younger brother.
