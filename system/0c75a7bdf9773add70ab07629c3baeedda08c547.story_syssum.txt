"I would not have picked this spot if it weren't for the streetcar, and my business has certainly benefited from our location," Steele said.
Other cities have plans and other funding for streetcar projects, too.
"Streetcars certainly create jobs, but they are a poor investment and create little lasting value," he said.
But there's nothing streetcars can do that buses can't do better, faster, safer and for far less money, said CATO Institute senior fellow Randal O'Toole.
Also, streetcars that run on either hydro or coal-generated electricity spit out less greenhouse gases per passenger mile than diesel buses, according to University of California researchers.
"It's absolutely easier than driving, and streetcar operators go out of their way to be helpful."
It's no secret that public transit offers commuters an escape from hectic traffic and a chance to read, make phone calls or snooze.
But on Capitol Hill, a House transportation committee spokesman acknowledged that there may be less federal money available for streetcar projects as Republicans prepare to take control of the House in January.
"Based on recent decisions by party members at the state and national level, that will mean a renewed emphasis on roadway projects and less proposed funding for transit."
