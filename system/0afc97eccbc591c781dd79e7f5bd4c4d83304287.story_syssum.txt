Congress seems to think it's bigger than the law, however, which might help explain one recent poll that found it less popular than root canals, cockroaches and Donald Trump.
If members of Congress can't pass a budget on time, they wouldn't get paid until they did.
And our elected representatives seem to have forgotten that presenting a stable plan on how to spend the money is a basic part of their job description.
The absence of a budget doesn't just violate common sense; there are real dollars and cents costs.
But it met stiff resistance from other members of Congress who didn't like the idea of personal accountability for institutional dysfunction.
A large number of centrist "Blue Dog Democrats" have announced their intention to vote for the measure, and the White House released a statement saying it would not try to oppose the measure because it would at least provide a "short term solution to the debt limit."
Not incidentally, that's also the reason "No Budget, No Pay" does not violate the 27th Amendment, which forbids salary increases or reductions during a current Congress: Their salary is not being reduced, it is being withheld until they actually do their job.
Congress is now the greatest single impediment to American economic recovery, in large part because a bloc of 50 or so votes on the far right seems enamored with playing chicken with our country's full faith and credit.
If patriotic conscience can't compel Congress to work together, maybe requiring them to have some personal skin in the game will inspire them to do their job.
