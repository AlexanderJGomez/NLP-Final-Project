Delbert Belton was in the parking lot outside the Eagles Lodge in Spokane on Wednesday night, waiting for a friend to pick him to go bowling, when the two teens robbed and assaulted him, leading to his death, police Chief Frank Straub Jr. said.
"We're hoping that he surrenders," the police chief said.
A retired aluminum company worker who served in the Pacific arena, Belton took a bullet in the leg during the Battle of Okinawa, friends say.
Police found Belton prone in the parking lot, with the Spokane County Medical Examiner's Office determining he'd died Thursday of blunt facial and head injuries.
His daughter-in-law, Barbara Belton, told CNN's Alina Machado that she couldn't fathom the reason for and viciousness of the attack.
After the incident, police scoured surveillance videos, wiped a nearby chain link fence for fingerprints and used dogs to hunt for clues.
