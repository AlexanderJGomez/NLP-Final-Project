Breitbart posted an edited video clip of Sherrod appearing to say she discriminated against a white farmer looking for assistance.
He has said he released the Sherrod video because he believes it shows the NAACP itself tolerates racist behavior within its ranks -- an accusation that came after the civil rights group made a similar charge against the conservative Tea Party movement.
Brent Bozell, head of the conservative Media Research Center, said Thursday Sherrod was the one who needed to apologize.
The controversy surrounding the clip led to a rush to judgment and Sherrod's forced resignation.
She received an official apology from the USDA and a phone call from President Barack Obama once the full text of her remarks came to light.
