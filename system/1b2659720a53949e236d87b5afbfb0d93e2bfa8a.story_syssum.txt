A Libertarian, he was one of 166 academic economists who signed a letter to congressional leaders last week opposing the government bailout plan.
The government implicitly promised these institutions that it would make good on their debts, so Fannie and Freddie took on huge amounts of excessive risk.
The fact that government bears such a huge responsibility for the current mess means any response should eliminate the conditions that created this situation in the first place, not attempt to fix bad government with more government.
In contrast, a bailout transfers enormous wealth from taxpayers to those who knowingly engaged in risky subprime lending.
According to this view, lenders are not making loans, even for worthy projects, because they cannot get capital.
The costs of the bailout, moreover, are almost certainly being understated.
If these assets are worth something, however, private parties should want to buy them, and they would do so if the owners would accept fair market value.
Anticipation of the bailout will engender strategic behavior by Wall Street institutions as they shuffle their assets and position their balance sheets to maximize their take.
The right view of the financial mess is that an enormous fraction of subprime lending should never have occurred in the first place.
