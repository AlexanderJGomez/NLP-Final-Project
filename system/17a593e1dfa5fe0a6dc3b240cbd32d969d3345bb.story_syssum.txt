Nationalist youths threw stones, gasoline bombs, golf balls and fireworks at police attending the Orange Order parade -- held on a date often marked by sectarian violence.
"Whilst I commend the bravery and leadership of many within the community who worked tirelessly to reduce the disorder and calm tensions -- we need everyone to keep working to build and maintain calm across all local areas," Assistant Chief Constable Alistair Finlay said in a statement.
On Monday night, police fired more than 50 plastic bullets and used a water cannon to disperse rioters, who threw more than 40 gasoline bombs, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said.
"We would appeal for everyone to do everything they can to help ensure all areas are calm and peaceful over the next 48 hours.
This year has been one of the most violent since the Good Friday Agreement.
