The Crimson Tide's offense sputtered in the extra session with two incomplete passes, a penalty for having 12 men in the huddle and a sack for a 5-yard loss.
After that, LSU marched down the field, nearly scoring a touchdown but running back Michael Ford stepped out of bounds.
Both teams were among the nation's best when it came to defense and Saturday's game was no exception with LSU notching a field goal in the last seconds for a 3-3 tie going into halftime.
Going into the game, LSU had outscored its opponent by 222 points this year, according to the school's athletics website.
