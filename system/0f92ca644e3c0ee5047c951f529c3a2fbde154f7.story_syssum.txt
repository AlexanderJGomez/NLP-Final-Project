(CNN) -- Just six weeks after the Australian Senate rejected a bill that included opening offshore processing centers for asylum seekers, a government-appointed panel has recommended just that.
Refugee Convention, Malaysia has no legal obligation to protect asylum seekers, something required under Australia's Migration Act.
Hours after the report was released, Gillard gave her in-principle backing to all its recommendations and said that Parliament would meet Tuesday to amend the earlier rejected bill to include the provision for processing centers on Nauru and PNG.
It doesn't address the circumstances, it just shifts the problem somewhere else," said David Manne, executive director of Australia's Refugee and Immigration Legal Center.
The so-called Pacific Solution was introduced by former Prime Minister John Howard in 2001 and involved sending asylum seekers to detention centers on Pacific Island nations while their claims were processed.
"The 'Pacific Solution' was a failed policy, and a wildly expensive one, that was internationally condemned for breaching the human rights of some of the world's most vulnerable people," he added.
Manne said it was questionable whether Nauru would meet the requirements to be considered as a legally viable option for offshore asylum centers.
Gillard said she is willing to compromise further to reach agreement and a policy on the issue.
