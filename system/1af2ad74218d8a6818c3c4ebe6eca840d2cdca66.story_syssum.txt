(CNN) -- A blustery nor'easter that made travel throughout the Northeast absolutely miserable Tuesday is going to stick around for a few more days.
"I urge all drivers to exercise caution and check conditions before getting on the road," Gov.
"We are proactively deploying as many resources as necessary to assist communities in the storm's path to prepare for and manage whatever Mother Nature brings."
About 20 million people are under winter storm warnings and advisories in the Northeast.
"1 storm down, 2 more to go," the headline on the website of CNN affiliate KOMO in Seattle read.
In West Virginia, an inch or so was predicted for the next few days, but it was an ice-covered morning for iReporter Janie Lambert of Harpers Ferry.
"By noon, the ice melted on the roadway but the trees were still an icy wonderland."
