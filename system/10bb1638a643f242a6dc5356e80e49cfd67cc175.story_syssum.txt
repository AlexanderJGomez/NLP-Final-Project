This seems to be a global truth that is perhaps best evidenced by the array of unusual food festivals the world over.
According to the Spam Jam website, almost seven million cans of the stuff are eaten in Hawaii every year.
Foods represented at festivals can range from the more mundane -- melons, pumpkins, potatoes -- to the downright daring.
La Tomatina -- where thousands travel to Spain to engage in a bustling tomato fight -- is perhaps the most famous of these, though there are many instances in which festival-goers feel the need to rollick around in grub.
"It's quite a sight to watch people wrestling around in mashed potatoes," admits Theresa Olson, the festival's executive director.
In Bessieres, France, the townspeople make a giant omelet every Easter to feed the poor, a tradition that supposedly started when Napoleon and his army stopped in the town for the night.

At the RÃ¤bechilbi Turnip Festival in Switzerland, for instance, locals create elaborate floats using 40 tons of hallowed out turnips.
"It's like eating too much beans."
