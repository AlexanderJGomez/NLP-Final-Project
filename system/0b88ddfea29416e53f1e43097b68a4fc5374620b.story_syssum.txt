(CNN) -- Abdul Aziz believes he was standing right next to a shooter Sunday when gunmen opened fire at a Mother's Day parade in New Orleans, injuring 19 people.
"We turned off of a main thoroughfare to a smaller residential street, and that's when the shots rang out.
"It's a little jarring when you see these types of things on the home front," he said.
We're plagued by crime, and it's just not getting better no matter what we do."
One of the suspects was described as an African-American male, approximately 18 to 22 years old, wearing a white T-shirt and blue jean shorts.
"It's important for us, as I have said, to change the culture of death on the streets of New Orleans to a culture of life, and it's going to take an all-hands-on-deck approach," he said.
