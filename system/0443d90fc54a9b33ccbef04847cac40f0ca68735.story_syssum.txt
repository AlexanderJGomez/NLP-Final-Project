(CNN) -- There's a great dive bar in my neighborhood called Jack's where they oven-bake the chicken wings.
But it's worth noting that, despite my undying love for these wings, I'm actually a complete coward when it comes to sauce.
Nevertheless, Dr. Ian Rothwell proudly became the first of more than 300 people to conquer Bindi restaurant's famous dish, "The Widower."
The recipe, which is openly shared online, has become a popular Web search as curry enthusiasts around the world clamor for new and interesting ways to make one of the most delicious and wonderful foods on the planet completely inedible.
Which, generally speaking, is a sure sign that whatever you're doing in the kitchen is less safe than, say, heating up a Lean Pocket.
And only a few have lasted past four or five mouthfuls, most opting instead to vomit, cry and rethink their overall purpose in life.
Eventually, with tears running from his eyes, Rothwell downed the very last bite of the world's hottest curry.
According to Guinness World Records, that honor was most recently set in March 2011 by the Trinidad Scorpion "Butch T" pepper from Australia.
The previously mentioned Infinity chili -- used in the Widower -- earned the highly coveted record a year earlier in March 2010 but was ousted only a few months later by the Naga Viper chili, also grown in the UK.
Or you can just be sensible and have something else.
