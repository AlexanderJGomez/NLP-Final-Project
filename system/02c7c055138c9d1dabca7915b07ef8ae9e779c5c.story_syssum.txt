But the dream of a reunion between the dissident journalist and his 32-year-old son came one step closer to fruition when Iranian authorities unexpectedly released the elder Saharkhiz last week after imprisoning him for more than four years.
Mehdi was at the design company in northern New Jersey where he works as a production manager when his relatives in Iran called with news of his father's release.
The former journalist had been working as an international spokesman for the campaign of Mehdi Karroubi, a moderate politician who ran for president in June 2009.
"They tortured me," he said, describing how officers beat him and broke his ribs during his initial detention.
During his incarceration, the writer said he was subjected to physical and emotional abuse, while also being held in solitary confinement for long periods.
Experts say Iranian authorities reserved especially harsh treatment of well-known intellectuals such as Saharkhiz because he was a former regime insider, who had risen to prominence after the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
As the elder Saharkhiz languished in prison in 2009, his son Mehdi became an opposition activist from the relative safety of exile in New Jersey.
But he said the move was likely linked to the recent election of Hassan Rouhani to the post of president.
His charm offensive during a visit to the United Nations General Assembly climaxed with a brief phone conversation with Barak Obama.
Though optimistic about Rouhani's presidency, Saharkhiz warned that Iran was a "double state," where true power lies in the hands of Supreme Leader Khamenei and senior military commanders.
He has yet to fulfill his mandatory Iranian military service, and he fears he could be detained due to his own outspoken criticism of the regime.
Meanwhile, his father predicted he is still at risk of being thrown back in prison.
It would be, his son said, a dream come true.
