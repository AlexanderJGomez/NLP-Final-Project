(CNN) -- As Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin E. Dempsey is the top-ranking officer in the United States armed forces, the most powerful fighting machine the world has ever known.

When he became the latest "tiger" caught in President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign last month, we were suddenly confronted with stories about his family's role in the sordid graft -- including a multimillion-dollar pre-paid debit card given to his daughter as a gift.
