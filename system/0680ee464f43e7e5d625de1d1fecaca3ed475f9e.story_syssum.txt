Delta Air Lines Flight 2566 from San Francisco to Minneapolis diverted to Salt Lake City on Wednesday when a pregnant passenger went into labor during the flight.
"I was getting contractions about every minute almost immediately, which was really scary ..."  mother Allison Peery told CNN affiliate KTVX on Thursday.
The aircraft departed from San Francisco bound for Phoenix, but diverted to Los Angeles International Airport at about 7:30 a.m. A nurse and doctor on board assisted with the delivery.
After a two-and-a-half hour delay, the 111 other passengers aboard Flight 623 were able to continue their journey to Phoenix aboard a new aircraft.
Southwest advises that pregnant women consult with their doctors before traveling by air, and the airline recommends not traveling after the 38th week of pregnancy.
However, "air travel is not recommended at any time during pregnancy for women who have medical or obstetric conditions that may be exacerbated by flight or that could require emergency care."
