The displeasure was reflected Tuesday in central Tunis, when roving packs of protesters staged demonstrations and up to 1,000 protesters took to the streets of the capital and called the country's new unity government a sham.
Another opposition leader, Mustafa Ben Jaafar, was to serve as health minister in the new government but suspended his participation in the united government, his spokesman, Abudallah Tif, told CNN Tuesday.
The move by the interim president and prime minister was seen as a way to disassociate themselves from the old guard and salvage the new government.
When peaceful gatherings started to grow in size, witnesses said, police would step in and start firing tear gas and chase protesters with their batons.
At the same time, more people began going back to work and more businesses were opening Tuesday, as many tried to restore a sense of normalcy despite the unrest permeating certain places in the restive country.
Monsef al Marzouki, the leader of Tunisia's National Congress Party -- a leftist and secularist movement that was banned by Ben Ali's ruling party -- returned to Tunisia from exile in Paris to cheers from demonstrators at the Tunis-Carthage International Airport.
"There are still a couple of demonstrations because people are against the fact that older members of the political party (will remain) in power," she said.
Unlike the previous two days, no demonstrations had taken place in Sfax Tuesday, the report said.
The EU will stand side by side with Tunisians as they pursue their peaceful and democratic aspirations," Catherine Ashton, the European Union foreign policy chief, and Stefan Fule, commissioner for enlargement and the European neighborhood policy, said in a statement released Tuesday.
