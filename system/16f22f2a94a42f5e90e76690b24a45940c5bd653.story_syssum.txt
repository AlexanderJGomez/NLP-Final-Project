(CNN) -- For more than a decade of my life, I struggled with debilitating anxiety, panic attacks and depression.
Somewhere deep in my soul, I was convinced that the medications were making me sicker instead of helping me heal.
So, despite my fears and those of my family, I decided to listen to my inner wisdom and wean myself off all medications under the supervision of my psychiatrist and explore holistic pathways to health and wellness.
Despite my mind's tendency to wander, like a mother lovingly guiding her wayward child back to its task I learned to gently guide my mind back to its still center.
I joined a health club and started working out three times a week, attended aerobics and yoga classes and trained with free weights.
She also taught me how to regulate my breathing to manage my anxiety, and self-talk to break through the vicious cycle of depressive ruminations and suicidal ideation.
Over the past 24 years, I have learned that wellness does not come encapsulated in a pill; rather, it encompasses the way I live.
The consistent practice of transcendental meditation, exercise, and cognitive behavioral therapy have helped me thrive in life despite recurrent bouts of anxiety and depression.
