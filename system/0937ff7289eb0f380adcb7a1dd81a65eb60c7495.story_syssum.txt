According to Standard & Poor's, Germany is the only country in the eurozone which still deserves the prized AAA rating with a stable outlook.
This is much lower than the double digit figures for the U.S. and UK fiscal deficits for 2011, which are expected to persist through this year.
The motivation for the downgrades given by Standard & Poor's actually cites the excessive attention given to fiscal austerity as one principal reason for the downgrading of a whole swath of euroland.
There are enough savings within the monetary union area to finance all public deficits of the eurozone's members.
This is why Italian funding costs have gone up so dramatically while the same time, the German government can collect money from investors when it issues short term paper.
By doing so it has prevented a collapse of the banking system.
The fiscal compact might be useful to prevent the next crisis a generation down the road, but this will not be very useful if the euro does not survive the present one.
