Following CNN's 2012 interviews with several voice actors, John DiMaggio (best known as Bender on "Futurama" and Jake on "Adventure Time") had been finishing work on a documentary that sought to pay tribute to those unsung famous voices behind animated icons.
"I Know That Voice," is set to make a splash with a Comic-Con panel Thursday, and features interviews with multiple generations of voice-over artists including Tom Kenny (SpongeBob Squarepants) and 95-year-old June Foray (Rocky the Flying Squirrel).
We'd just been talking about stuff we wanted to do and Larry said we should do something about voiceover.
I kind of wanted to make a valentine to the folks I work with, and give a little face-time to these folks who entertain so many people all of the time and don't really get credit.
The nice thing about the voice acting community is there's this camaraderie, we know there's work for everyone.
DiMaggio: People are starting to recognize me at these conventions, but as soon as I walk away from the convention, people don't really know who I am, which is great because I love flying under the radar.
Some people say, "I want to get into voice acting because I have an interesting voice," but there's so much more to it than that, bringing characters to life through your acting abilities.
They're starting to cast names a lot more in cartoons, because a lot of people are becoming hip to the job.
"Really, I don't have to go to the makeup trailer and wait 10 hours to shoot one scene?"
Sometimes they'll give millions of dollars to an on-camera celebrity who isn't as convincing as one of the voiceover greats.
