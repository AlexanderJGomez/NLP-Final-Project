Washington (CNN)John Boehner and his allies scrambled to lock down support for his reelection as Speaker on Tuesday morning as the small army of conservative lawmakers promising to vote against him continued to expand.
Rep. Justin Amash, one of the original dozen that opposed Boehner for speaker in 2013, said in a Facebook post that while "Speaker Boehner has given his best to our conference...it's time for Republicans to change our leadership."
Florida Rep. Ted Yoho, who is just starting his second term in the House, is one of the conservatives collaborating to spark a second round of voting, and has offered him up as an alternative to the Ohio Republican, along with Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert.
"We announced on Saturday that we were going to throw my name in the hat and you've seen a groundswell, a grassroots movement of people saying, 'You know what, I appreciate you offering us an alternative because I'm tired of the status quo,'" Yoho said.
