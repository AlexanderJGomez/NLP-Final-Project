For the past few months, the Egyptian media and state institutions have been ardently working to pave the way for el-Sisi's presidency by distorting and smearing his political opponents.
With regional support mainly from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who fervently seek to abort the Arab Spring, el-Sisi believes that he can suppress and tame the mounting anger and frustration among young Egyptians particularly Islamists who protest almost daily.
Even as the Obama administration receives harsh criticism for its policies towards the Egyptian junta, Secretary of State John Kerry seems keen not to anger Egyptian officials.
The U.S. policymakers believe that Egypt's military is the only force capable of retaining stability and maintaining security.
For example, the Sinai Peninsula, which represents around 6% of Egypt's land, is almost out of the central government's control.
Although he has garnered significant public support since the ouster of President Mohamed Morsy, there are no guarantees that el-Sisi-mania will continue once he is president.
With the absence of any coherent economic policy, el-Sisi's presidency wouldn't be able to soothe the fears of many needy Egyptians who view him as a new Gamal Abdel Nasser.
An el-Sisi presidency would be a major cause for instability and insecurity in the region and would likely create more extremists and radicals.
