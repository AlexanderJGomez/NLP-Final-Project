Every single president in our nation's history, except for John F. Kennedy -- a Catholic -- and Barack Obama, has been a white Protestant.
Except for a handful of exceptions, for over 200 years the presidential nominees of both major political parties have been WASPs.
Times are so bleak for WASPs that there's not a single one on the Supreme Court.
The demographics of our nation are changing and, by 2042, minorities are expected to become the majority in the U.S.
However, in the GOP's defense, a party that is 90% white, they have started to slowly showcase minorities, such as Sen. Marco Rubio and Govs.
(That screaming sound you might have heard was Michele Bachmann shrieking in horror at the idea of a Muslim-American president.)
That means rich white men with money get to control the political system.
Over time, some states abandoned the requirement of land ownership so that poor white men could vote.
And it took all the way to 1920 -- more than 100 years after our first president was elected -- that women were finally given the right to vote with the passage of the 19th Amendment to our Constitution.
And there is no doubt that another white Protestant will rise up one day against the growing odds and win the White House.
