(CNN) -- Residents along the Gulf Coast continue to get pounded by heavy winds and unrelenting rain from Tropical Depression Isaac, an eerie reminder of Hurricane Katrina, which pummeled the Gulf Coast seven years ago.
"We have nearly 200 emergency response vehicles that have been prepositioned in safe areas along the Gulf Coast," Hart said.
The Salvation Army is building up emergency response teams and supplies in affected areas along the Gulf Coast.
They're going to need to start the long journey of repairing and replacing the damage that's been done by the storm," said Maj. Terry Ray, Mississippi Gulf Coast area commander.
The organization will be asking for volunteers once the storm passes to aid in relief efforts including debris removal and roof repair.
