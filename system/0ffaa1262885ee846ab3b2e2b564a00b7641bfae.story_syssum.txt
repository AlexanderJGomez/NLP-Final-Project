(CNN) -- Divers have found what they believe are human remains on the wrecked Costa Concordia cruise ship, the Italian Civil Protection agency announced Tuesday.
The new discovery of remains comes about three weeks after engineers managed to rotate the ship back to vertical.
The trial is expected to last through the fall with a string of witnesses, including passengers, crew members and islanders, who say they saw the captain on shore looking for dry socks before all the passengers had been safely evacuated.
The helmsman, Jacob Rusli Bin, and four others were convicted in a plea deal in July for their role in the disaster.
