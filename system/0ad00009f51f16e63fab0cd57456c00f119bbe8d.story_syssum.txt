(CNN) -- After receiving nearly 100 reports of stuck gas pedals in Ford and Mazda vehicles, federal regulators said Tuesday they have launched an investigation into the problem, which is a suspected cause of one death and nine injuries.
Several of the reports to the NHTSA involve vehicles not covered by previous recalls, the agency said in a letter to Ford's Environmental and Safety Compliance Global Director on Thursday.
Some of the complaints allege that failures may have been related to repairs made in response to safety recalls initiated in 2004, the investigation summary said.
The petition was denied Thursday because part of the request is being covered by the agency's newly opened investigation.
