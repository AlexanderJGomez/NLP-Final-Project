It's a fire the international media has been happy to flame, quick to draw links between various acts of savagery and heavy metal even if, as in the case of the Columbine shootings and Marilyn Manson, evidence points to the contrary.
"I think people look at heavy metal and label it for all sorts of things because we need easy answers to complex questions," Dunn says.
"I think it comes from being a child of the '70s," says Iron Maiden's lead singer Bruce Dickinson.
I wouldn't always say in a tongue-in-cheek way, but there is an element of it.
Ironically, the fundamentalist reaction to "The Number of the Beast" packed out Iron Maiden tour gigs in every American town they visited.
It's an approach that chimes with what one female Iron Maiden fan, Ruth, tells us, "I really don't see any violence in the fans and I have been to loads of their gigs," she says.
So while upside-down crucifixes, homicidal zombies and lashings of blood might continue to fuel our preconceptions about heavy metal music, it's worth remembering, appearances and reality can be very different beasts indeed.
