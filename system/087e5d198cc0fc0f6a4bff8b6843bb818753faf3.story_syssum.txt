(CNN) -- Despite all the political tension in Crimea, it's nice to know things are still safe enough at the zoo for a zebra to get it on with a donkey.
That living, breathing reminder is a beautiful baby "zonkey" named Telegraph, who recently came into the world at the Taigan Zoo park near Crimea's main city, Simferopol.
So, it sort of makes sense that Telegraph was named for a local newspaper, honoring the publication's fifth anniversary.
Although cross-breeding of equines is not unheard of, it is rather rare and unconventional.
Eventually, the zoo moved the lonely zebra into a different part of the complex where she could be surrounded by other hoofed animals.
Because now we have this silly looking thing with a brown upper body and zebra legs.
An adorable baby polar bear with a tortoise shell would pretty much stop the world from spinning.
But, no matter the species, whenever you get a cute baby cross-breed, you sort of have to enjoy it while you can.
Mr. Ware tried to teach me in high school, but I was far more interested in depriving others of their education.)
Anyway, that's the story of a cute little zonkey who is currently enjoying his 15 minutes of worldwide Internet fame.
