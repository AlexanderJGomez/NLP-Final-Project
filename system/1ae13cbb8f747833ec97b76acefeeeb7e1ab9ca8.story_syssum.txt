(CNN) -- Last season's finale of "How I Met Your Mother" finally answered the lingering question of who exactly is the mother of the TV series' title.
"We thought we'd be done after eight seasons," Bays told CNN.com after the panel, "so season nine is a bonus year and it's the Wild West.
"How I Met Your Mother" has traditionally used multi-episode narrative arcs and flashbacks to keep the story moving, often jumping in time or extending a season over the course of a year.
"We last left our gang when Lily and Ted were driving out together, Barney and Robin were driving out together and Marshall was planning to come back from Minnesota for the wedding.
"It seems like it's something Marshall wants to tell her in person," Segel said.
It's neat for us to see things unfold."
Fryman confirmed fans will see Ted meet the character very quickly into the ninth season and said viewers are "going to get to know her."
"We built this big train station set you saw in the season finale.
The cast members seemed emotional about "How I Met Your Mother" coming to an end, but Harris said they are just trying to enjoy filming this season.
Smulders, who also appears in the season premiere of the new ABC show "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D," said, "It hasn't started to sink in yet.
But we have six more episodes after the holidays, and I feel like that's going to be a really intense time for everyone."
"I was actually talking with Carter and Craig last night about how there's this new fashion of dumping 12 episodes out.
Like Netflix is now giving all these episodes, and they can do really serialized arcs.
When you're at the top of the mountain and you look back, you say, 'Wow, we got to do some incredibly strange, amazing moments of television.'
