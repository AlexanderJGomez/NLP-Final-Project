In a suit filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Angelo Binno alleges the Chicago-based ABA prevents law schools from waiving the admission test, known as the LSAT, for blind applicants.
A spokesperson for the ABA said its lawyers have not yet seen the lawsuit, nor been served with documentation, and the association could not comment at this time.
The litigation focuses on the analytical reasoning or so-called logic games section of the test, which requires ''spatial reasoning and diagramming of visual concepts for successful completion by most applicants,'' according to the suit.
Binno, who is not suing for monetary damages but retains the right to do so, wants the ABA to change its policies on blind applicants and the LSAT.
"We're fighting so we can have more disabled attorneys who are going to create more disabled rights,'' said Bernstein, who teaches social justice at the University of Michigan, and said he runs marathons and has completed an Iron Man triathlon.
