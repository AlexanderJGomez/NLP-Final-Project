Franck Ribery and Karim Benzema, who both played for France at the Euro 2012 finals in June, were first questioned two years ago about their alleged involvement in a prostitution ring.
One of the girls, Zahia Dehar, appeared on the cover of "Paris Match" magazine in April that year and in an interview said she had sexual relations with several players on the national team, including Ribery, whom she had met at the club.
Ribery allegedly bought a plane ticket for Dehar, but Bottai said he never personally booked it and never saw her passport.
Dehar has since become a fashion designer, and launched her own collection this year.
