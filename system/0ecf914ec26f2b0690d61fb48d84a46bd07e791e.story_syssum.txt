The tests showed Corexit to be slightly less toxic than the manufacturer's data had indicated, so no new orders were issued.
That is a place that testing often starts because you want to know what concentration of the chemical will kill fish or other organisms," said Richard Denison, senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund.
As for human health, scientists say much more needs to be learned about dispersants -- their behavior with oil, chemical ingredients, chronic and delayed effects -- to understand the risks.
Some scientists disagree over dispersants' ability to break down the oil faster than it would naturally decompose.
Another unknown is whether the chemical constituents of oil are more or less likely to persist in the food chain.
I don't think we have enough data to answer those questions very well, and I'm hoping that this tragedy will spur us to answer those questions so we'll have enough information next time."
