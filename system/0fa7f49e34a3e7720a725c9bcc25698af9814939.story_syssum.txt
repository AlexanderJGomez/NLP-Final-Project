Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat who often finds himself at odds with the White House, said spending $500 million to provide weapons to groups in Syria that are fighting both ISIS and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will backfire.
Government funding runs out at the end of September and if new legislation isn't passed, many government services will come to a halt.
Congressional leaders are reluctant to hold a stand-alone vote on the measure because of the upcoming midterm elections less than two months away.
"I am gravely concerned by reports of ISIS seizing and utilizing U.S. weapons intended for those fighting against the Syrian regime, and we must have greater assurance that we aren't arming extremists who will eventually use the weapons against us," Begich added.
"This has to be a ground game by the people of that region."
