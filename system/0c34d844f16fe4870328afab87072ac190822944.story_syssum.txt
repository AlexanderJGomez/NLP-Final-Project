Washington (CNN) -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid plans a first vote Tuesday morning toward renewing unemployment benefits for about 1.3 million Americans who lost them when they expired at the end of December.
Roughly 1.3 million long-term unemployed were affected when Congress failed to continue a 2008 recession-era federal law providing nearly a year of benefits, paid for by U.S. taxpayers, that kicked in when state jobless benefits ran out.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates continuing them for another year will cost about $26 billion.
Democrats are refocusing on issues relating to economic inequality, which is important to their base.
"And it really -- while it seems good, it actually does a disservice to the people you're trying to help."
The tone set by this first political showdown could foreshadow the tenor of future fights over funding the federal government, raising the debt ceiling, efforts to try and repeal or roll back portions of the President's signature health care law and the long-postponed fight over immigration reform.
