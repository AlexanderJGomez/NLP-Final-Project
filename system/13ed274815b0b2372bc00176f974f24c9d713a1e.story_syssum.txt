Lorna Irungu, 35, had to travel from Kenya to India to receive her third kidney transplant.
Irungu says what she couldn't find was a doctor who would do the tricky third transplant in her own country of Kenya.
So the former television host was paying for the surgery and medicines out of her own pocket.
The cost of a kidney transplant in the United States can be $25,000 to $150,000, also out of Irungu's price range.
Dr. Vijay Kher, the hospital's director of nephrology, first talked to Irungu by phone.
Doctors said it was unnecessary to remove the three other kidneys because they were not causing harm and they didn't want to subject her to more surgery than was necessary.
Even with the complications that can arise during a third transplant, the cost of it and the weeklong hospital stay in India came to about $8,000.
"It's worth it because instead of you sitting wherever you are, thinking, 'This is the end for me,' or just getting depressed or getting into this struggle,  (you can) just pack up and go."
