This special holiday variation of my Green-Eye Daiquiri gets a flavor boost from quickly flamed fresh thyme, which releases the herbal aromatics and adds a little holiday theatrics!
Bend the thyme sprigs and curl into the bottom of a heavy heat-proof double old-fashioned glass.
Be careful glass does not get too hot -- have something available to smother the fire if it gets too big.
It is important to make it in this order as the simple syrup will put out the flames.
I created this cocktail for the Fairmont Abu Dhabi's new nightclub and bar, the Chameleon.
Place the ginger in the bottom of a cocktail shaker.
Using a muddler, press down on the ginger a few times, giving it some force but not too much muscle.
In a small sauce pan, bring the water, sugar and dried flowers to a boil.
Let the syrup cool and then place in a clean bottle or pitcher, cover and refrigerated up to two weeks.
