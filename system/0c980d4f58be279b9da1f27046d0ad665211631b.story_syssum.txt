The advent of Bitcoin ATMs is seen as a step towards bringing the digital currency into the real world.
The virtual currency has generated lots of media attention in China where investors have helped drive the price up to dramatic highs above $1,000.
After choosing an amount of cash you'd like to withdraw, the software installed in the ATM generates a code which you have to scan with your smartphone.
Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) and Central Bank released a joint statement on their website on Monday stating it does not recognize Bitcoin as an accepted form of currency.
Installing ATMs require the authorization of the FSC, but it will not be approved, thus it is 'impossible' for Bitcoin ATMs to enter or appear in Taiwan," Central News Agency reported.
While it did not outlaw individuals from owning Bitcoin, it specifies that it is not to be considered a currency.
