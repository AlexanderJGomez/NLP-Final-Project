In Tagalog "pagpag" means the dust you shake off your clothing or carpet, but in Fabon's poverty- stricken world, it means chicken pulled from the trash.
Fabon is the merchant and pays the trash dealer just over a dollar for tonight's supply of garbage and scraps.
After bagging up the chicken scraps she heads home to Tondo, a neighborhood infamous in the Philippines as one of the poorest slums in Manila.
Sumanda lives in a shanty that sits on top of one of Manila's biggest garbage dumps.
Sumanda's toddler son, Nino, wails as she first washes the chicken, heats the pot and adds vegetables to the pagpag, which is mostly bones.
PCF's school educates 450 of the most poverty-stricken children in Tondo, with the aim of freeing families from poverty.
Maria Theresa Sarmiento, PCF's manager of health and nutrition, says that when the school first opened she was treating children with a range of illness and disease.
"By the mercy of God, this is enough," she says.
