The Clinton Foundation admitted last month that a 2010 donation from the Algerian government was not properly approved under the guidelines the Obama administration put in place with the foundation when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009.
Clinton continued: "You've got to decide when you do this work, whether it will do more good than harm if someone helps you from another country.
Republicans jumped on board the story, too, using it to question the Clintons' ethics and whether, as president, she would give preferential treatment to countries that have donated to the foundation.
Democrats that did publicly defend the Clintons noted that the foundation disclosed all of their donation on their website.
To date, the foundation has raised over $2 billion that goes toward a wide variety of projects, including health and wellness, economic development and leveling the playing field for women and girls.
The former secretary of state spent 18 minutes on stage Saturday and didn't mention question about her email, instead focusing on the foundation and a new report they will put out on women and girls participation.
This year brought together students looking to do a wide variety of things, from increasing women's inclusion in science and math fields to harvesting potable water from fog.
A few students, including Victoria Arild from Menlo College, said they hadn't heard of the controversies.
