"People are writing horror stories ... but people just can't imagine the kind of sickness we're talking about," said Dr. Nicholas Namias, medical director of the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center in Miami.
He has not been able to speak with police since his desperate fight for life began October 12, when police say five teenage friends, including a 13-year-old, doused Brewer with rubbing alcohol and set him on fire.
Namias explained how Brewer's organs are not functioning the way they should be, but that is expected at this early stage of recovery.
Namias also explained that in burn cases, words must be chosen carefully when talking about patients and their condition because so much is at risk and so much can change quickly.
On Monday, the five teens who are accused of taking part in the attack appeared separately before judges in Broward County, Florida.
Michael Brewer's parents, Valerie and Michael Brewer Sr., issued a written statement through the hospital last week.
"Surviving is a miracle of modern medicine and about the technology and the things we do.
Across the hospital floor in the burn unit at Jackson Memorial Hospital, six other people's lives also are at stake: all victims of various accidents, all with burns similar to Michael Brewer's.
This didn't have to happen at all."
