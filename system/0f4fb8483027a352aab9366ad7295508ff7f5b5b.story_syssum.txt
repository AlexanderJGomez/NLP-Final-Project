(CNN) -- Syrian opposition leaders have dubbed Friday's planned demonstrations "Friday of Saleh al-Ali," a prominent Alawite who commanded one of the first rebellions against the French mandate of Syria in the early part of the 20th century.
Their report comes a day after Turkish government officials, including Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, met with a special Syrian envoy to help stem the growing tide of refugees.
Calling for a "strong, stable and prosperous Syria," Davutoglu urged the timely development of a "comprehensive reform process" there and an end to the discord in Syria.
"The most egregious reports concern the use of live ammunition against unarmed civilians, including from snipers positioned on rooftops of public buildings, and the deployment of tanks in areas densely populated by civilians," according to a preliminary report prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.
"The material currently before the high commissioner is a matter of grave concern and reflects a dire human rights situation in the Syrian Arab Republic," the report said.
"The international community has been shocked by the horrific reports of torture and arbitrary arrests, and widespread use of violence against peaceful protesters," said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland.
