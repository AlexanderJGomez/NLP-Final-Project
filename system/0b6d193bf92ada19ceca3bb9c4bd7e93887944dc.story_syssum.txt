There are two Rick Santorums: The first one I might not agree with, but the second one truly scares me.
The only reason you may not be aware of it is because up until his recent surge in the polls, the media were ignoring him.
Yes, that means exactly what you think it does: Santorum believes that each and every one of our government's laws must match God's law, warning that "as long as there is a discordance between the two, there will be agitation."
... And those truths don't change just because people's attitudes may change."
Santorum's fundamental problem with Sharia law is that it's "not just a religious code.
It is also a governmental code.
Santorum has stated that his religious beliefs dictate that life begins at conception, and as a result, rape victims would be sentenced to carrying the child of the rapist for nine months.
Santorum would ban all federal funding for birth control and would not oppose any state that wanted to pass laws making birth control illegal.
I think many would agree that alone should disqualify him from being president.
