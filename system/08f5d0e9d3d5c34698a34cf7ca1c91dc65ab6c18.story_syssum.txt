Sen. Ted Kennedy hit the airwaves to say it was "indefensible" he didn't immediately report the accident.
Kennedy vanished to the family compound for days after the incident, huddling with advisers before emerging the following week to plead guilty to leaving the scene of an accident.
In a display of the senator's legendary oratory, he delivered a nationally televised explanation and apology, saying it was "indefensible" that he hadn't called police until the day after the accident.
According to a Time-Harris poll in August 1969, about 44 percent of respondents said Kennedy failed "to tell the real truth," 51 percent said his explanation was inadequate and 77 percent said he was wrong not to report the accident immediately.
In 1969, the national media were dominated by three TV networks and a handful of magazines and newspapers.
In his national address, Kennedy said he was driving Kopechne to a ferry landing because she was tired.
Kennedy said he dived back into the water several times, "but succeeded only in increasing my state of utter exhaustion and alarm."
He asked to be taken to the ferry slip, he said, where he jumped into the water, swam the 500-foot channel back to Edgartown, returned to his hotel room and collapsed.
The media clamored with questions: Why had Kopechne left her purse and room key at the cottage and told no one she was going home?
Today, Baughman said, Kennedy could still survive a Chappaquiddick -- largely because of the Kennedys' clout and because Massachusetts is so enamored with the family -- but it would be tougher with the Slate.coms and Drudge Reports of the world hounding him.
"In the cable news era, that would not have been possible," he said, explaining that blogs and other new media would have prodded the networks and newspapers.
He also never obfuscated details to benefit Kennedy -- in part, because of a paternal adage he has always held dear.
