Washington (CNN) -- The District of Columbia public school system announced Friday that it is letting 226 employees go for poor performance under the education assessment system IMPACT.
We have graduated a generation of Washingtonians who don't have the skills and knowledge that they need to be  productive members of society because our schools have failed them."
The teachers union has no say in which evaluation system that the D.C. public school system chooses to use, and by contract, teachers can be let go for low evaluations.
"But the thing is, in the whole year, we have raised, and the teachers have raised, lots and lots of different issues about the evaluation system, and the person who turned a blind eye to it was Michelle."
"But the question that I ask to them is 'Whose children are we going to put in the classroom of ineffective teachers next year?'
Also Friday, the district announced that it has notified 737 employees that if their performance doesn't improve, they will be terminated after the upcoming school year.
