And more than half of those attacks were carried out by suspected Somali pirates, an international maritime watchdog group said Wednesday.
Of the incidents this year, Somali pirates accounted for 54 percent: they launched 168 attacks.
Somalia's transitional government, which has a tenuous grip on power, has been unable to stop the pirates -- many of whom are based in the port cities.
When they find one, the pirates board smaller boats and move in, typically with five to seven armed hijackers per boat.
Those who have tracked pirate activity say it started in Somalia in the 1980s, when the pirates claimed they were aiming to stop the rampant illegal fishing and dumping that continues to this day off the Somali coast.
Piracy accelerated after the fall of the Somali government in the early 1990s and began to flourish after shipping companies started paying ransoms.
