Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Five militants suspected to be behind an airport attack in Peshawar were killed Sunday morning when police raided a house where they were hiding.
Mian Iftikhar Hussain, information minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said after the attackers fired the rockets they tried but failed to drive an explosives-laden vehicle into the airport.
Two of the rockets landed inside the airport and the other struck outside the facility.
Militants have a strong presence in that region, which borders Afghanistan.
