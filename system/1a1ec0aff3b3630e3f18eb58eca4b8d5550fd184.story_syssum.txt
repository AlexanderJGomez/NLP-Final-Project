While President Barack Obama held a news conference on Thursday where he announced an administrative fix to the Affordable Care Act, it quickly digressed into a confession and apology hour.
Obama's self-deprecating confession, combined with his administrative "fix" to allow people in the individual market to keep their current insurance plans, did not, however, completely alleviate concerns of Democratic lawmakers.
He said the federal government "isn't going to get in the way" of insurance companies offering plans to existing customers in the individual insurance market that don't meet minimum coverage requirements.
Former President Bill Clinton chimed in, saying Obama should keep his promise.
The real test on whether Obama alleviated Democratic concerns will be if Democrats back a Republican proposal Friday by Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan that would largely undermine Obamacare.
His approval rating among American voters has dropped to its lowest number in a Quinnipiac University polling since he became President with new doubts being raised about trust.
"I am not a perfect man and I will not be a perfect President, but I'll wake up every single day working as hard as I can on behalf of Americans out there," he said.
