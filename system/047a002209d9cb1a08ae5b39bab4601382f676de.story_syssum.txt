The shooting led to a tense couple of hours at the station, where scuffles with police broke out -- and what appeared to be lit fireworks were thrown -- as scores of people gathered to see what happened in an area still emotional over the August 9 shooting of Michael Brown.
But Hoskins, who is black, said that this shooting cannot be likened to Brown's death, in part because unlike the Ferguson case, this one was captured on video and allegedly involves an armed teen.
Jay Nixon issued a brief statement saying, "The events in Berkeley are a reminder that law enforcement officers have a difficult, and often dangerous, job in protecting themselves and law-abiding citizens."
County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the shooting was tragic, but stressed the teen pointed a gun "straight out" at the officer, who fired in self-defense.
The officer, whom police did not name, lost balance and fell as he moved back in reaction, but managed to fire what investigators believe were three shots, hitting the gunman at least once, Belmar said.
In the Martin case, video released by authorities showed a second man nearby who fled when the shooting occurred.
Martin's father, Jerome Green, said his son had indicated he was going out to meet his girlfriend and had not mentioned any other person who might be with them.
The officer involved was given a body camera before he left for patrol, but he wasn't wearing it during the shooting, possibly because he was distracted when a supervisor gave it to him earlier Tuesday, Belmar said.
Protesters late Tuesday and early Wednesday gathered around an ethnically diverse group of dozens of police officers, who stood between them and the scene.
KMOV video showed a white plume rising at another location down the street.
Belmar said someone had tried to set a fire at a nearby store, but someone extinguished it.
Berkeley is a city of about 8,000 people flanked by St. Louis International Airport to the west and Ferguson to the east.
