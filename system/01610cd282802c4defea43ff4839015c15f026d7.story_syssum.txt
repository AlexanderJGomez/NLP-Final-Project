The controversial church and its pastor, Fred Phelps, have made their name picketing near funerals of people who died of AIDS, gay people and soldiers.
On Monday -- their first day back since the shootings became public -- students at Liberty Middle School wore blue and black in memory of Beau, who was an eighth-grader there.
He is devoted first and foremost to honoring the lives and memory of his beautiful children, Calyx and Beau," the statement said.
The warrant provides new details in the case: Five bullets, along with a Smith & Wesson box and instruction manual, were found in the master bedroom; 15 live rounds and five spent shell casings were in the master bath.
Beau's body was later found in the front seat of an SUV inside the home's garage, police said.
Police later found writings in the house, thought to be from Schenecker, in which she spelled out her intentions in detail.
