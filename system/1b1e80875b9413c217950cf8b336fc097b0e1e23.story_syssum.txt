As he lowers himself below the surface of the ocean in his diving gear he becomes something of a fish whisperer, an underwater pied piper.
People could spend years in, say, the Caribbean and see less sharks than we can in just one single dive.
Just 2% of the world's waters are protected, and Sala knows he has a gargantuan task ahead of him that needs massive backing by the world's governments.
A day's boat ride north from New Caledonia's most northern tip, the Waitt's Institute research vessel has, until recently, been bobbing for the last three weeks slowly on the water's surface.
Now I go to these places and see what it used to be like, to see what the future could be elsewhere with regeneration."
He was a boy when first captivated by the magic of the sea, inspired by the famous former diver and explorer Jacques Cousteau.
Sala's current quest is aimed at not just protecting certain waters but regenerating those that have been fished to within an inch of their lives.
The aim is to ensure protected areas become increasingly rich in fish and other underwater life, thereby spilling into other waters as it becomes overly abundant, thus in the long-term having a positive knock-on effect to fishermen.
"Being able to experience nature, and raw nature at that, first hand is like going back in the past.
Sharks have become synonymous with fear in the sea, thanks in part to Steven Spielberg's "Jaws" film with John Williams' ominous stringed musical buildup to each unwitting victim of a shark attack.
"They are also great for the health of the reef, and the idea that they are dangerous is wrong.
"It's become much easier as governments who we've worked with pass laws limiting the areas that can be fished," he explains.
Slowly, sea by sea he is clearing up the planet's waters, and he is determined to continue.
