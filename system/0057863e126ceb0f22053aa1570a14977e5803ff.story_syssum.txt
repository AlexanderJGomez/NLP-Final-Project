Minutes before the meeting of Australian Labor Party (ALP) caucus members, former leader Kevin Rudd made it clear that he would not be pitting himself against his former rival.
He was referring to comments he made last February after mounting an unsuccessful bid to depose Gillard.
Before the vote, Crean said he wouldn't be nominating himself as leader, but would take the job of deputy.
However the vote produced the first hung parliament in Australia since 1940.
The parties clashed over a number of issues, not least a controversial mining tax and a move by the government to reject World Heritage Listing for the Tarkine wilderness in north west Tasmania.
