It's the way that television critics despise Leno, and how that colors the coverage of the late-night wars.
Leno has the top-rated show at 11:30.
The man who bounced back from his last firing and regained the late-night throne?
But here's the thing: Leno doesn't appeal to anyone but the viewers.
At least those who live west of the Hudson River and east of the Santa Monica Mountains.
The Times reports that a top executive ordered Leno to stop mocking the network, a ham-handed attempt at censorship that has obviously failed.
But in their haste, NBC execs risk blowing up the situation the way they did in hustling Ann Curry off the "Today" show, sparking a backlash against Matt Lauer and sending what had been the iconic morning show plunging into second place.
Do they really need to immolate one of the few time periods where the network is No.
And they are entitled to their views of who has comedic chops and who is out of gas.
