The debate follows mounting criticism of Netanyahu's move to use the high profile address to criticize President Barack Obama's policy on Iran.
House Speaker John Boehner invited Netanyahu last month to speak in the House chamber, but did not consult with the White House before officially reaching out to the Israeli leader.
He could still deliver his sharp message on Iran, but also repair the damage he's done to his relationship with Democrats on the Hill, who are angry their allegiance to a key ally is being questioned.
They also hope to have a meeting with White House officials in which the President could drop by, though there's little evidence the administration is interested in making such a deal.
As much as I love Angela, if she was two weeks away from an election, she probably would not have received an invitation to the White House, and I suspect she wouldn't have asked for one," Obama said.
When foreign leaders are invited to address the House and Senate, the Vice President typically attends speeches and sits on the dais behind the leader - a public image beamed around the world.
Netanyahu's Likud party is in a close election race with the center-left opposition led by Labor Party chairman Isaac Herzog and former justice minister Tzipi Livni, who leads a small centrist party.
Both Herzog and Livni, who have teamed up to form an alliance in the election, have criticized Netanyahu's decision to address Congress and have urged him to cancel it.
Another poll published by the Times of Israel on Monday showed Netanyahu's party four seats in the Knesset behind Herzog and Livni's  Zionist Camp alliance.
