Unlike the recent high-profile homicide of Yale University graduate student Annie Le, the death of the 20-year-old Dallas woman, known as Shelley to her friends, has captured virtually no media attention outside Texas.
The institute is "a design, media arts, fashion and culinary post-secondary school," according to its Web site.
Her apartment was in Dallas' northeastern Lake Highlands neighborhood in a building complex home to dozens of students from the institute.
The police report indicates Nance was "stabbed with an unknown cutting tool."
Stockton added a bulletin board has been set up for anyone to post memories of Nance.
"She was a great student, always came to class, always involved on campus," Stockton said.
