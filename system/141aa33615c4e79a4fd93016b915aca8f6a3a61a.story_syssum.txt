(CNN) -- The European Commission is looking into France's expulsion of more than 8,000 ethnic Roma, commonly referred to as gypsies, the commission's president told CNN Tuesday.
They tend to live in camps, caravans, or informal settlements and have been the target of persecution throughout history.
As interior minister, he advocated the deportation of foreign nationals caught in violent riots across France in 2005.
The government called the comparison absurd since those being expelled were being sent back to their homelands with financial compensation of 300 euros ($381) per adult and 100 euros ($127) per child, according to France's immigration ministry.
