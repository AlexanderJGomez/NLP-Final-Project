"This is the first time we had to close off air filtered by the facility to the outside," Energy Department spokesman Gregory Sahd told CNN.
Due to the late hour and the location of the incident, Sahd said there was little risk to employees.
"And everyone that was in the facility (at the time), we know where they are and we've tested them."
The safety of WIPP personnel and the surrounding community is of the utmost importance."
