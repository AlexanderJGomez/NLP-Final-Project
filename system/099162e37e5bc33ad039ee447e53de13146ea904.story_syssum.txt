Holmes received a high volume of deliveries over the past four months to both his home and work addresses, which police believe begins to explain how he got his hands on some of the materials used in the attack and those found at his apartment, said Aurora Police Chief Daniel Oates.
Technicians, with the help of a robot, worked to handle traps, wires and possible explosive and incendiary devices, according to Jim Yacone, a special agent with the FBI who briefed reporters alongside Oates.
All occupants except those who live in the suspect's building were allowed to return home Saturday night, police said.
"I think that overall the community is very, very shaken, and I think we're in shock and I think we're still trying to get our arms around how did such a tragedy happen to us," said Rhonda Fields, a Colorado state representative.
Investigators have said little about what may have led the suspect to open fire during a premiere Friday of the Batman sequel "The Dark Knight Rises."
But Holmes soon went out a rear door leading from the theater to the parking lot, leaving it propped open, the source said.
The federal law enforcement source's information about the suspect's appearance fits with a statement made to reporters by New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, who said he had been briefed by Colorado authorities.
"There was blood everywhere," Christina Blache, a shooting victim, told CNN's Don Lemon from her hospital bed Saturday.
Holmes had bought the guns legally at stores in the Denver area over the past two months, Oates said.
"If you think we're angry, we sure as hell are angry about what has happened to our city, what has happened to these wonderful people who live here, and also what he threatened to do to one of our police officers," the police chief said.
Holmes, who is being held in Arapahoe County Jail, is scheduled to appear in court on Monday morning.
