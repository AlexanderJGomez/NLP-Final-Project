Now, however, comes the time to be explicit: to speak out loud his affiliation, his fraternal pride and concern.
In appearances before African-American audiences, the president sometimes sounds like he's saying the wrong thing.
The president has not spoken out forcefully against racial profiling and mass incarceration.
Asked why he hadn't done more to remedy the catastrophic rate of African-American unemployment, Obama said, "I can't pass laws that say I'm just helping black folks.
Emanuel Cleaver, while chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said "the president knows we are going to act in deference to him in a way we wouldn't to someone white."
There is a long waiting list of boys, mostly without dads in the home, and only about 10 active African-American male mentors.
President Obama cannot, on his own, reverse this course, but he can do much more than he has to disrupt the flow of the one in three young black men who are headed to prison.
Barack Obama was once a young black man who smoked pot, and it would be surprising if he actually believes that it's fair for other young black men to be selectively prosecuted for that.
What a difference it might make for the millions of black boys who now are headed to destinies very different from graduating from Morehouse College or becoming president of the United States.
