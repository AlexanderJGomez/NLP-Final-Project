Thanks again to everyone who made links between China and Turkey, the latest pair of countries we've been trying to connect.

We always love personal stories and were so excited when a couple about to tie the knot in Istanbul shared some connections.
They also both have fast-growing economies and are emerging powers, said "Momolu Dorley."
The next set of countries we're looking at is Australia and Angola.
