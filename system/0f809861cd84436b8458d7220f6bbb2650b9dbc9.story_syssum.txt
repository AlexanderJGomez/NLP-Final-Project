(CNN) -- As investigators in Georgia looked into the death of a 22-month-old boy left seven hours in a sweltering SUV, they seized computers from the father's office, a source with knowledge of the investigation told HLN's Nancy Grace.
Police in Cobb County, just outside Atlanta, have been tight-lipped and haven't said whether what they found on the computer is one of the reasons they arrested Harris.
In an obituary for Cooper appearing in the Tuscaloosa News, the family asks that in lieu of flowers donations should be made to the Homer Fund.
They said the dad had apparently forgotten the boy was in the back seat of his Hyundai Tucson; he didn't remember until he was done with his workday, drove a couple of miles and pulled into a shopping center parking lot.
On the day Cooper died, Harris stopped for breakfast at a fast-food restaurant and afterward strapped his son into a rear-facing child restraint seat on his SUV's back seat, police said.
During his lunch break, he returned to his car, opening the driver's side door to put something inside, police said.
The charging of Harris triggered a wave of sympathy and a vigorous debate over whether the heartbroken father should be punished.
If that is the case, the DA now knows that the community does not want Justin prosecuted on murder charges."
As Harris sits in jail, his wife, Leanna, would not discuss the case with the media.
The medical examiner's office is waiting for toxicology test results before making an official ruling as to the cause and manner of the toddler's death.
