Banksy may have started out as a graffiti artist in western England but his work now sells for millions in the coveted evening contemporary art auctions at Christie's and Sotheby's.
Banksy knows that his reputation was made on street corners, not in establishment hang-outs like the auction rooms of London and New York.
Next to each piece is a toll-free number that the finder can call to receive an audio commentary of the work whilst standing in front of it.
The lingering question is: Will anyone locate Banksy himself and publish that picture on Instagram?
