There's a broad divide between those who support developments in Kiev -- where parliament was voting on an interim West-leaning, national unity government Thursday -- and those who back Russia's continued influence in Crimea and across Ukraine.
Yanukovych will give a news conference Friday in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, Russian state media reported.
Concerns are building that the tensions in the autonomous Crimean region might escalate into a bid for separation by its Russian majority.
Just over half its population is ethnic Russian, while about a quarter are Ukrainians and a little more than 10% are Crimean Tatars, a group oppressed under former Soviet leader Josef Stalin.
Yatsenyuk, who has been both economic and foreign minister in past governments, told reporters that Yanukovych "is no longer the President, he is the person under investigation and accused of crimes against humanity," state news agency Ukrinform reported.
Yanukovych's decision to scrap a European Union trade deal in favor of one with Russia prompted the protests, which began in November.
As Ukraine's interim leaders work to restore stability, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, speaking at a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels, Belgium, urged all parties to avoid "provocative actions" in Ukraine.
U.S. officials earlier told CNN that the Russian military exercises were making U.S. military and intelligence agencies concerned that Russia may be positioning ground forces to be able to move across the border into Ukraine if Moscow issued such orders.
He added that government security forces, which were outside the buildings, would not use force or weapons to take over the buildings.
"Orders have been issued to create a cordon around the Parliament in Crimea and to avoid shooting and violence."
