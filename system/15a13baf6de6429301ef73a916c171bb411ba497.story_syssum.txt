"Upon arrival, we observed a heavy smoke condition in the entire cabin," said Bob Donahue, chief of the Massport Fire Rescue Department.
Batteries used to start the auxiliary power unit, which provides electricity for ground operations, are located in the small area in the belly of the plane.
One firefighter had a skin irritation from the material used to put the fire out, but no one else was injured.
Monday's incident is not the first mechanical problem for the 787 series, which was delivered to airlines starting in 2011 after years of manufacturing delays and cost overruns.
While serious, Hiatt did not think these issues are a sign of larger concerns with the 787 program.
"We need to give our technical teams time to really understand the event," Lori Gunter, spokeswoman for the 787 program, said in a statement.
"It's one of our 'most wanted list' issues, fire in transportation," Eric Weiss, a board spokesman, said.
