(CNN) -- A California mother was arrested this week after she was captured on video encouraging her son to pummel another boy, police said.
Jennifer is heard yelling a barrage of profanities and enticing the fight," Ceres Police said in a statement.
Police also credited a man who witnessed the fight and can be seen on the video stopping it.
"I don't care," the woman replies.
