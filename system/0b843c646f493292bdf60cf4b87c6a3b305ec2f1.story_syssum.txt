Pam Biggers disappeared while on a business trip to the Florida Panhandle in January 2008.
Biggers' bed did not look slept in, police said, but it appeared that she had been reading in bed.
Her open book and glasses were on the bedside table, and the pillows were propped up against the headboard.
Biggers said he was concerned about his wife's health and urged her to not go on the business trip.
The hotel did not have surveillance cameras, so it is not known when Biggers left or whether she was alone.
Anyone who has seen Pam Biggers or has more information leading to the person or people responsible for her disappearance is asked to call the Bay County Sheriff's Office tip line at 850-747-4700.
She is a white female who stands 5'8" tall, weighs 135 pounds and has green eyes and gray hair.
