Washington (CNN) -- Senior Navy enlistees seeking credentials to train others on using nuclear reactors that power carriers and subs are under investigation for cheating on an exam that may have involved classified information, top military officials said Tuesday.
Those cited had previously been certified on nuclear systems, gone to sea, returned to shore duty and had to be certified as instructors to stand watch at training reactors.
Navy officials stressed that the nuclear propulsion systems are not related to nuclear weapons.
"With respect to the morale and the necessity to pass these exams in order to advance, that's not really a dimension of our program," he said.
