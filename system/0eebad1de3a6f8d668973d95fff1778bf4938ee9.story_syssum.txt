The typhoon, known locally as "Glenda," prompted the evacuations of as many as 350,000 people from their homes in towns and cities across the country.
At about midnight Tuesday, the government announced one casualty -- a person killed by an electrical post that was uprooted.
He said that, at that time, more than an inch of rain was falling per hour in the city, many areas of which are susceptible to flooding.
According to a statement from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the typhoon was expected to affect 43 million people spread across 22 provinces.
As the storm passed Legazpi, James Reynolds, a freelance videographer who spent the night in the city, ventured out and saw what he described as a "community effort" to clear the fallen trees and power lines, and repair some of the property damage.
It was expected to be of Category 2 strength but upon hitting land turned into a Category 3 storm, with sustained winds of 205 kilometers per hour.
Rammasun is the first to hit since last year's Typhoon Haiyan killed more than 6,250 people, left more than 1,000 missing and caused widespread destruction.
The storm is expected to brush the northern part of the Chinese island of Hainan on Friday evening local time (Friday morning ET) as a strong typhoon, likely still a Category 3.
