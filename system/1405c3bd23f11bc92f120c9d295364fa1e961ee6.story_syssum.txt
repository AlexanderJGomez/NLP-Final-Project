(CNN)An Oklahoma reserve sheriff's deputy accused of fatally shooting a man he says he meant to subdue with a Taser pleaded not guilty Tuesday to a charge of second-degree manslaughter.
"This will give us an opportunity to deal with the facts in the courtroom instead of the media and we're looking very much forward to that," said  Clark Brewster, one of his lawyers, after the hearing.
The lawyer for the family of the man who was killed claims that Bates wasn't qualified to be on the force, but received preferential treatment because he'd made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff.
Over the weekend, one of Bates' lawyers released most of his training documents and said they prove Bates had proper law enforcement training.
