"What we do know is that last Wednesday, shortly after 7 o'clock, we received a 911 call from a gentleman stating that his 2-1/2-year-old son accidentally shot his mother -- the boy's mother," Rues told HLN's Vinnie Politan.
In that roughly 4-1/2-minute call, a man's voice can be heard asking the dispatcher what to do.
Bennett and the boy's father were not married and did not live together at the time of her death, according to Rues.
It's not safe," she said.
