On top of that money, the opera company also needed to raise an additional $13 million by the end of 2013 to put toward future seasons, it said in a news release.
It opened its current season on September 17 with the opera "Anna Nicole," which turned out to be the company's last production.
"NYCO management's reckless decisions to move the New York City Opera out of its newly renovated home at Lincoln Center ... predictably resulted in financial disaster for the company," Gagliardi said.
This year marked the 70th anniversary of the New York City Opera, which opened in 1943 as the second opera house in the city.
