The incidents come a day after one person was wounded when a parcel bomb addressed to Greece's Mexican Embassy exploded.
The third parcel was addressed to the German Embassy, but it was detonated near a courier office because embassy officials thought it might be a parcel bomb and sent it back, police said.
Both also were carrying Glock 9mm pistols and were in possession of two other explosive parcels, including one addressed to French President Nicolas Sarkozy, the ministry and police said.
One of them is a suspected member of the Greek leftist militant group Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire.
