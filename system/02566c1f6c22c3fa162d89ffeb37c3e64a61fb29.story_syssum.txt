Kaufman County Judge Bruce Wood said he thought there was a "strong connection" between the slayings of Mike and Cynthia McLelland and the shooting death of Kaufman County Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse, who was killed on his way to work in January.
On Saturday, authorities found the McLellands' bodies in their home in Kaufman County, east of Dallas.
"But everybody that works in the courthouse has been on edge, but he never indicated any fear to me."
Authorities are providing extra security for others, and the Kaufman County district attorney's office will be closed on Monday.
McLelland was an Army veteran who later earned a master's degree in psychology and became a psychologist for the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation, the district attorney's website said.
The McLellands were killed almost exactly two months after Hasse was shot to death in broad daylight outside the county courthouse on January 31.
McLelland called Hasse "a stellar prosecutor" who knew that threats were part of the job.
"I hope that the people that did this are watching, because we're very confident that we're going to find you," McLelland told reporters.
Schulte told the station that after someone shot through the windows of his Dallas offices in November, he began to carry a gun more often.
