(CNN)Before Ellen DeGeneres was out and proud and dancing every day on her talk show, when heterosexual male actors wouldn't dare to play gay, and violence against gay people was the talking point of the day for LGBT activists, there was transgender activist Leslie Feinberg.
Like the customers who had enough of police brutality and rioted at New York's Stonewall Inn in 1969 and energized a movement, there was no closet big enough to hold Feinberg, who passed away November 15 at age 65.
For a 20-something like me coming out in the early 1990s, there was nothing trendy or cool about being out.
Always a writer and journalist, I came out during my last year in college, stayed out in graduate school, and have been out at every job I've ever held; I did service work in my profession to bridge the gaps between journalists of different racial, ethnic, LGBT and other identities.
There was no parachuting into a town to get everyone rising up for gay rights but forgetting when those allies needed help on race or gender or other issues.
Feinberg linked them all together, organized and protested in the streets and fought for all of us.
That was Feinberg's gift to me, and to you.
