"It made my stomach turn," Bertha Lewis, chief executive officer of ACORN, told reporters at the National Press Club in Washington.
She backed up the group's legal action in Maryland against the makers of one of the videos.
Just because we were embarrassed by these highly edited tapes, which don't tell the whole story again, and hopefully that will come out, doesn't mean that these people didn't break the law in order to embarrass and attack the organization," Lewis said.
The U.S. Census Bureau has terminated ACORN's involvement in its public outreach program, both chambers of Congress have voted to deny federal funding to the organization, and several states are looking into ACORN operations.
"And so nine months later it finally began to resonate with folks that we had not had one individual who voted fraudulently in the presidential election because of an ACORN registration -- not one Mickey Mouse, not one Donald Duck, not one New York Jet, Giant or any other fraudulent person."
She disputed reports that a subpoena from the Louisiana attorney general's office showed that the amount was up to $5 million.
She said e-mails from Karl Rove, when he was Bush's top political adviser, show that ACORN was targeted to stop its voter registration efforts because "we were moving too many minorities to vote" and "changing the power dynamics" in local elections.
Lewis said ACORN has been demonized and news about it has served as a Republican fund-raising tool.
This is not how we have discourse,' " she said, making reference to the familiar phrase from McCarthy-era hearings in the 1950s: "Are you now or have you ever been a communist?"
