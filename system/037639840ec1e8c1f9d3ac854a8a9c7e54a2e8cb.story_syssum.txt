Take "Sad Song," on which the opening salvo -- a terse guitar strum set against the machinelike thwack of snare drum and hand claps -- is such a note-perfect evocation of the band's vintage attack that it almost plays like winking self-parody.
Listen back to "Just What I Needed" or "Drive" and you'll hear where many of today's young bands learned their tricks: how to mix guitars and synthesizers, how to make rock that's as tuneful as bubblegum, and pop that's as stylishly sinister as rock.
But the thing that has really set them apart is groove, and Ocasek is at his best in songs like "Keep on Knockin'," singing a jittery version of the boogie blues.
Orr added some warmth, a touch of daylight, to the proceedings, but with him gone, Ocasek has burnished the group's music to a glossier shade of noir.
