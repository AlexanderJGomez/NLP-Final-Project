During a status hearing in bankruptcy court scheduled for July 20 in Las Vegas, creditor ABKCO Music & Records plans to ask the court to conduct an auction of the items in the Montague Collection, which includes slave and indentured servitude documents, a signed copy of Phillis Wheatley's "Poems on Various Subjects" dated 1773, and a handwritten letter from Booker T. Washington seeking financial assistance for 221 students at Tuskegee.
Years ago Montague and his wife of 56 years, Rose Casalan, began taking out loans to archive and prepare the collection for sale.
It is in the hands of a trusteeship charged with selling it to satisfy the debts, including a judgment for $325,000 plus fees from New York-based ABKCO, an independent entertainment company that owns rights to recordings by Sam Cooke, The Rolling Stones and Bobby Womack.
Dotan Melech, the federal bankruptcy trustee charged with administering the Montague estate, is still hopeful he can find a buyer or get more time from the court.
He has sent letters to a few hundred individuals and nonprofits that have shown interest in the collection asking them to submit their best bid by July 13.
"If you have five children and two are taken away, it doesn't hurt less because you got three back," he said.
"I only want to look ahead, that it can be done," he said.
