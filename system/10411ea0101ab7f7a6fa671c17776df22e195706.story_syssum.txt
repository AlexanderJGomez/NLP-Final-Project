Shouldn't you find out if you have cancer and then decide whether to treat it?
The story, preposterous as it is, rings psychologically true because it taps into the most primal of all human terrors: Having one's body invaded by something different than oneself, especially when that thing is not just different, but dangerous.
In the case of heart disease, there is only the failure of something we've always had ticking away inside us.
To understand the mental health implications of this idea we have to take a step back and ask why abandoning the PSA test would improve our society's health.
That's good news for the affected individual, but bad news for overall health and well-being, because this conclusion only comes at the end of a medical work up that includes a biopsy and other procedures that come with their own health risks.
Sometimes it grows, but grows so slowly that the person will almost certainly die of old age before succumbing to the cancer.
At the most basic level, the knowledge that one harbors an ignored malignancy would place many people in an emotional state reminiscent of the unfortunate main character in Ray Bradbury's story.
The cost of this knowledge would be especially high for those already predisposed to mood and anxiety disorders as a result of a tendency to worry, to ruminate, to focus too greatly on their health.
So from a mental health perspective, it seems to me the guidelines around PSA testing are clear: To continue PSA testing in low-risk individuals will significantly increase mental health morbidity if treatment guidelines change such that prostate cancers are not routinely removed.
