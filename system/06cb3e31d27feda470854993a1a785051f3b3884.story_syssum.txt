It was a desperate plea from a tearful dad, tossed like a message in a bottle into the vast sea of the Internet.
"I know it's a shot in the dark, but I don't care," he said, his voice breaking.
By late afternoon it had hundreds of thousands of views and he was deluged with Facebook messages.
As Berlin listened, stunned, they told him would indeed make a personalized "A Look Back" video for Jesse, using posts he had made public on Facebook before his death in 2012 at age 21.
The 62-second clips note the year the user joined Facebook, then show a handful of their most-liked posts and a seemingly random selection of their photos -- all set to instrumental music.
Facebook realizes that by granting Berlin's wish, they risk being deluged with similar requests from other users wanting to see video highlights of their deceased loved ones.
But he said Facebook, which introduced "memorial" pages for deceased users in 2009, wants to give users better ways to honor their loved ones on the site.
Jesse Berlin was a musician and played rhythm guitar in Fivefold, a popular Missouri rock band.
John Berlin posted Jesse's "A Look Back" video on Friday to YouTube and his Facebook page, where it's been liked and shared thousands of times.
