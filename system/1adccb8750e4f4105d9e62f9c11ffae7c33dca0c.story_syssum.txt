White is accused of shooting 17-year old Daniel Cicciaro in the face on August  9, 2006, outside his Long Island home after a heated exchange with Cicciaro and his friends.
Riverhead police say this all started with an Internet prank sent from the MySpace page of White's son, 20-year-old Aaron.
Aaron White says he then went home and received more calls from Cicciaro and his friends, telling him they were coming to his house to kill him.
John and Aaron White walked out of their house, both holding guns, and had a heated exchange with Cicciaro and his friends.
Under testimony, Aaron White's friend Michael Longo admitted he logged on to Aaron's MySpace page and sent the threat to the girl as a joke.
"You had this group of white men who felt that they were going to defend this young white woman from a black man who said these things about her, and they felt justified to do so because of his race," said defense attorney Fred Brewington.
With tears in their eyes, Daniel and Joanne Cicciaro say their last image of their son was in the hospital, drenched in blood and being given CPR.
Friends and supporters of both the Whites and the Cicciaros have attended the trial daily, which presented its case to the jury Tuesday.
