The Army specialist told HLN's Vinnie Politan that the tight timetable and sheer distance led him to believe that his chances were slim of joining wife Ashleigh Ramirez in Fort Polk, Louisiana, before their child was born.
On Thanksgiving morning, Ramirez said he boarded a flight to Alexandria, Louisiana, then quickly hopped on the road -- still about one hour, 15 minutes from the base in the western part of the state.
Specifically, the soldier said he burst into the hospital room about 30 minutes before his son, Jason, made his own grand appearance.
"I couldn't ask for a better gift than to have him healthy and here with me."
