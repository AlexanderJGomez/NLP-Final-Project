Editor's note: Dina Mehta is an ethnographer, social media consultant and blogger based in Mumbai, India.
There was a lot of confusion, anger and sadness as we witnessed together parts of our city go up in flames -- icons and symbols that stand for the Bombay I grew up in.
Some of us have worked together during disasters like the tsunamis and Hurricane Katrina, and we used our influence and experience to get the word out.
The morning after, a friend and fellow blogger in the United States asked me how I was coping with it all.
Some of the little things that touched me were people all over the world just volunteering time, love and attention through hugs and words of solace.
Others abroad were busy proclaiming that they would run to India and not from it.
â€¢ Overwhelmed by the kind and touching emails that my clients have sent since yesterday.
These spontaneous responses bring home so strongly that what we are dealing with is not just Mumbai's problem or India's problem alone.
Many of us are being asked how people can contribute to help families affected, and today we meet with non-governmental organizations to try to work out how we can harness this amazing energy online into raising funds for those affected by the attacks in the short term.
We are bonded, and I truly believe that in the face of utter horror, wherever it might occur, we have a strong pillar in this emotional connection we feel as equal human beings and not in our narrow identities prescribed by nationality or religion or race or gender.
And yet, I find I do not want to have that discourse or feed these divisions.
