"I know a lot of people that are from the Bronx, Gen. Powell, and if you think the values there in the Bronx today reflect the ones you grew up with, take a trip back and see if the street corners and the activities there are the same as when you were growing up."
It used to be that more families ate dinner together and high school students worked summers and after school.
It's caused me, or rather, allowed me, to work harder and pull myself up by my bootstraps without anyone else helping me.
