They're upset that Bill Clinton is buying American-made watches, manufactured in Detroit, to give to his friends.
Republicans want us to think, somehow, that Hillary Clinton has not been fighting for all of us for the past four decades.
Hillary Clinton's entire being -- her lifetime history -- reflects her commitment to ensuring that the ability to get ahead should be determined by hard work, ambition and goals, not by circumstances.
That's four decades' worth of work on behalf of the American people -- a record that should deflate any smoke and mirrors attack by the right wing.
While the right wing remains focused on making sure the top 1% of income earners can keep their Bush tax cuts, Hillary Clinton continues her work today to make sure that other people get the chance to live the American Dream that she has experienced.
Americans know -- hands down -- that Hillary Clinton will continue looking to the future, fighting for the middle class, and putting first the lives of all Americans.
