Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- A Florida teenager attacked and set on fire last month, allegedly by five teenage friends, was undergoing skin graft surgery Friday, the first procedure in his recovery, a hospital spokeswoman said.
On Thursday, three teens accused of setting Brewer on fire pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder, a public defender for one of the boys said.
"It's been decided by society that a 15-year-old can't vote, can't join the armed forces and cannot buy alcohol, because society has recognized that children do not have the ability to appreciate the long-term consequences of their actions," he said.
Authorities say that Mendez admitted setting Brewer on fire, and that he made a "bad decision," according to an arrest transcript.
Brewer's doctor told CNN the teen faces several more months in the hospital, and will need multiple skin grafts and surgeries.
"I just tell him he's in the hospital and he's safe and he's getting better.
When Brewer did not pay, police say, Bent stole Brewer's father's bicycle.
According to witnesses, the five boys called Brewer "a snitch" and set him on fire.
"I can describe both of them as being tearful at various times during the interview, especially when talking about the specific incident which led to the injuries of the victim."
Psychologists also must evaluate whether the defendants can talk about what happened and communicate effectively with defense attorneys.
