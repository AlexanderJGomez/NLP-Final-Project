This comes on the same day that astronomers and news reporters alike were turning their attention to a 40 meter asteroid -- known as 2012 DA14 -- which is due for a close approach with Earth on Friday evening.
They are left over rubble from the chaotic birth of our solar system around 5000 million years ago and, for the most part, are found in a "belt" between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
Traveling through the sky at a few kilometers per second, friction with the air can cause the meteor to break up into several pieces.
The force of the explosion laid waste to a dense area of forest covering more than 2000 square kilometers.
It is not hard to imagine the devastation of such an event over a more highly populated region.
However, today's meteor strike shows that it is not currently possible to pick up everything.
