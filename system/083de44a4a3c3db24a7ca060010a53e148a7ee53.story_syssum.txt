A single mother, Jablonski often felt as though she were in crisis mode, until she found a support system last year called Mom2Mom.
Cherie Castellano, who launched Mom2Mom in 2010, has started a number of initiatives based on the idea of "reciprocal peer support": that people with similar experiences can help each other.
"It's not just good for the moms they're helping, it's also good for them because they get to feel connected and recognize their own strengths," Castellano said.
In the initial call, the peer counselor mother will find out from the caller what she is calling about and then asks, "How are you?"
The program has gotten calls from more than 20 states where moms struggle to find support as they care for special-needs children.
Many mothers of special needs children want to appear as "supermoms," being able to balance all of their appointments and challenges and emotions, Castellano said.
"Moms don't want to seem like they're depressed about it or they're sad about it or they're afraid of what's going to happen to their child when they're gone," Castellano said.
She was one of the first callers to Mom2Mom and connected with peer counselor Mary Beth Walsh.
She had put her whole self into her children and had lost sight of taking care of herself.
"It just made me see that I could still look nice even though I'm overweight," she said.
Both these mothers took part in a Mom2Mom collaborative project expressing their feelings and struggles through artwork; each sculpture consists of two pieces of glass connected to look like a book.
