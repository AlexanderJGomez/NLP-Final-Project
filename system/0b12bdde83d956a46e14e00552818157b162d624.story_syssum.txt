Ira Freeman, the chief pharmacist at Key Pharmacy in Los Angeles, testified on the seventh day of a preliminary hearing for Howard K. Stern -- Smith's lawyer and companion -- and co-defendants Dr. Khristine Eroshevich and Dr. Sandeep Kapoor.
Freeman said he consulted Dr. Greg Thompson, a pharmaceutical expert, who agreed with him and who offered to talk with Eroshevich about the dangers.
Thompson recommended to Eroshevich that she "forget the paparazzi and get her to a hospital" if she needed all of those drugs, Freeman said.
Freeman said he always understood that prescriptions written under the pseudonym "Michelle Chase" were intended for Smith.
"She was very concerned that we needed to wean her off the medications," Brighthaupt said.
A series of affidavits used by state investigators to obtain search warrants in their 2Â½-year inquiry was unsealed last month, revealing many details of the prosecution's case.
