(CNN) -- The man who says he was behind the Manti Te'o girlfriend hoax claims he was in love with the Notre Dame linebacker, but the athlete knew nothing about the ruse.
I did all that I could to help this person become a better person, even though I wasn't getting nothing out of it.
"One of the people I happened to add was his cousin," he said, referring to Te'o's cousin.
"I never wanted to become a relationship wrecker or nothing like that," he said.
Tuiasosopo said he and his younger sister met Manti in November, the night before Notre Dame's 22-13 victory over rival USC at the team's hotel.
But something would bring them back together, whether it was something going on in his life or Lennay's life, in this case in my life," Tuiasosopo said.
Thursday's segment is the latest revelation in what began as a story of one of the nation's best college football players leading his team to victory hours after learning his girlfriend had died, a story dismissed as a hoax after it was revealed Kekua did not exist.
As he and his team excelled, Te'o told interviewers in September and October that his grandmother and girlfriend, whom he described as a 22-year-old Stanford University student, had died within hours of each other.
Tuiasosopo insisted he was telling the truth but said he would be uncomfortable talking in his feminine voice for the TV host.
Sometimes people lie," Ludwig told CNN's Erin Burnett OutFront.
"And the reason why he impersonated this woman was to see what it would feel like to be intimate with Manti Te'o, to be loved by Manti Te'o," she said.
