Both records are available separately as pre-orders, via the website ArtOfficialAge.com, and include "instant gratification" downloads.
The pre-order includes the songs "Breakdown" and "Clouds," as well as three digital singles.
"No one can play like this band," Prince told Rolling Stone about the record.
He also previewed the record at a late-night listening session in New York City, which revealed the hard-rock guitar number (and pre-order instant-gratification track) "Pretzelbodylogic," as well as the original version of "Funknroll."
"Prince is one of just a handful of visionary artists who have truly reshaped and redefined modern music and culture," Warner Bros. Chairman & CEO Cameron Strang said in a statement about the two new records.
All of us at WBR are immensely proud to be working with Prince to bring this brilliant new music to his legions of fans around the world, and needless to say we are thrilled to be working in partnership with him again."
