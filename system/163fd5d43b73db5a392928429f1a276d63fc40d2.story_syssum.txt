In a rare phone conversation, Putin briefed his counterpart in Beijing, President Xi Jinping, on "Russia's position on the issue and measures Russia had taken to tackle the crisis," the state-controlled Xinhua news agency reported Wednesday.
Referring to the demonstrations in Ukraine's capital last month that culminated in the removal of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, he said: "We condemn the recent extreme and violent acts there and have been urging the relevant parties in Ukraine to resolve their internal disputes peacefully."
As for Washington's strategic partnership with China, it had been rooted largely in a shared enmity toward a common enemy -- the Soviet Union.
"In the past, China and Russia have often worked together to block international action (often led by the West) to address global crises, by claiming their respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty," said Paul Haenle, director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center of Global Policy in Beijing, noting their recent veto of sanctions against the Syrian regime.
Other China watchers believe Beijing's stance may be rooted in issues closer to home, noting that the country does not want to give the appearance of backing a separatist movement, given its own problems with ethnic tensions, primarily in the western regions of Tibet and Xinjiang.
China will also be considering its considerable interests in Ukraine too -- especially its economic ties with the now deposed government in Kiev.
Shen Dingli, professor of International Relations at Shanghai's Fudan University, believes a pragmatic China would be open to working with the fledgling administration in Kiev.
"Meanwhile, facing greater pressure and potential sanctions from the West, Russia will be happy to strengthen its relationship with China."
