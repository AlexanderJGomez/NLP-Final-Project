The Indian batsman, who is the highest Test run scorer of all time, achieved the unprecedented feat during a one-day international against Bangladesh on Friday -- having been stuck on 99 hundreds for 33 innings.
It hasn't sunk in," Tendulkar told the host broadcaster after his historic knock.
Enjoy the game and chase your dreams.
Chasing India's 289 for five wickets, openers Tamim Iqbal and Jahurul Islam put on 113 for the second wicket.
His century provoked an outpouring of joy on home soil after a long wait.
His current total of 33,854 runs in international cricket has cemented his status as a pioneer of the modern game and his enthusiasm for the game still burns bright as he prepares to turn 39 in April.
Tendulkar recorded his 99th international hundred over a year ago as part of India's successful World Cup campaign on home soil.
The closest player to Tendulkar in terms of hundreds is former Australia captain Ricky Ponting, who has 71 centuries.
