But Nadal fought back in typically ferocious fashion to take the first set and then overrun Raonic in the second to reach his seventh consecutive final since returning to the ATPTour in February following a knee injury.
I won the third game, which was very important for the match, because if you are 3-love down against a big server like Milos, you're in big trouble."
It is the 20th time the 27-year-old has reached a World Tour final but he has a 0-8 record against Nadal -- the most recent defeat coming at the semifinal of the Abierto Mexicano Telcel in February.
But once again Sharapova was pegged back in the second, as the German rallied to take the set comfortably.
I won this tournament last year on the way to the French Open so I am really pleased to get back into the final again," Sharapova said.
