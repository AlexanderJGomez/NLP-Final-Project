The daughter was to have been named Carolina, but that plan was changed after the August 5 cave-in trapped her father, Veronica Ticona said.
Ticona said her brother was told of the birth by a video conference system.
Segovia discovered that their child would be a girl by looking at a grainy ultrasound on August 4, the day before the mine collapse.
A few days after seeing her daughter on grainy, flickering ultrasound images, Segovia saw her husband on grainy video that the miners shot by the flickering lights mounted on their mining helmets, then packed into the tube for the journey upward.
