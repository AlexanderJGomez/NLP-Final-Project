In the era before the printing press, handwriting was a highly specialized and labor-intensive monastic discipline, one undertaken only by those who had committed their lives to the church.
In the opinion of Arnie Sanders, associate professor of English at Goucher College in Baltimore, the history of handwriting is a perfect encapsulation of how the collision between the secular and the sacred has informed our literary traditions.
"The leaders of the scriptorium were looking for people who cared enough about books and writing to dedicate their entire lives to the process," he said.
In all three of the Abrahamic faiths -- Judaism, Christianity and Islam -- handwriting is inexorably connected to religion and the worship of God .
Though the two disciplines are separated by more than a millennium of history, they share fascinating similarities and parallels in their evolution, Sanders said.
"In the early era, while scribes were still working to produce books, before the printing press, you just hired a scribe if you were rich," he continued.
Gothic lettering is famous for its complex and ornate style, which can be extremely confusing to the uninitiated.
Their ultimate goal was the "wider distribution of their manuscript works about the pagan classics as well as to challenge Medieval religious orthodoxy," Sanders said.
"After that last burst of clarity, once literacy spreads beyond professional scribes to ordinary readers like you and me, manuscript writing becomes distorted and stretched out by the very difficult-to-read early modern cursive script of the 15th to 17th century," he said.
It's the surest evidence you need for the importance of handwriting to the culture."
