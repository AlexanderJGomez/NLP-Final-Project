(CNN)Jeffrey Williams admitted he fired the shots that struck two officers in Ferguson, police said, but claimed he wasn't aiming for them.
For more than 200 days, protests have taken place in Ferguson since the August shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.
One element of the case that authorities have yet to sort out is intent, McCulloch said, adding that Williams has acknowledged firing the shots but has said he wasn't aiming at the police officers.
The shots rang out from a hill overlooking the city's police station shortly after midnight Wednesday, at the end of a protest against the Ferguson Police Department, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at the time.
"In no way are they representative of the thousands of people ... who have been protesting," said Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman.
The department has been criticized since the shooting death of Brown and, more recently, since a scathing U.S. Department of Justice report documented a pattern of racial discrimination in the city.
While many protesters have decried the Ferguson Police Department, neither of the officers shot last week were from the city.
He is a 41-year-old officer with the St. Louis County Police Department, who has been in law enforcement for 14 years.
