Nick Cannon spoke out on Friday's "Piers Morgan Tonight" about the recent health scare that left him fighting for his life.
"Through a bunch of tests and studies," said Cannon, "they found out that I have lupus nephritis, which is an autoimmune disease.
After hosting the Super Bowl preshow, Cannon started feeling pain again, this time above the kidneys.
Cannon joked that he calls his wife "Dr. Carey" because "she knows when I'm supposed to take my medicine, what I'm supposed to eat... "
Cannon said that he is relishing the family time.
Carey, who was a close friend of Houston's, attended the funeral, but Cannon was hospitalized at the time.
