Howard Jackson, a prosecutor with the Brooklyn District Attorney's office, told reporters Saturday that Daquan Breland faces a criminal possession of a weapon charge in addition to second-degree murder.
Breland and another young man, Daquan Wright, were apprehended Friday morning by New York detectives and U.S. marshals at a Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, apartment according to New York police Commissioner Ray Kelly.
Both men have some kind of relationship with the young boy's father, 21-year-old Anthony Hennis, who as of Friday had declined to be interviewed, according to Kelly.
Even if you don't know this child, you couldn't help but grieve for the family."
