It was just after 4am and the team of highly specialized salvage experts, who were feeling proud about the unprecedented rotation of the massive vessel that crashed on Giglio's shores in January 2012, were making their way to the dock from the control room where they'd spent the last 19 hours.
Habib, himself a salvage master, stepped aside while the star of this particular show, Nick Sloane, the 52-year-old South African in charge of the Concordia salvage, and his key team took center stage.
Many of the salvage workers sat at the outdoor tables, just like they do after every shift and wondered just what all the fuss was about.
But for the Giglese, it is the first concrete step towards moving the beast from the island's shore.
When the morning sun finally rose to show the Concordia's twisted and bent starboard side, the horror of the wreck suddenly seemed more real than even the night it happened.
Islanders mingled with journalists who studied the wreckage from every possible angle exchanging binoculars and long-lens cameras to get a better view, pointing out bizarre details of a scene that literally petrified the moment the ship crashed into the rocky shore.
There was nothing to do but stare.
