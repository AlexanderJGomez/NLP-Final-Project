Ariel Gonzalez, director of health and family advocacy at AARP, says the group remains supportive of the legislation -- which was signed into law in March 2010 -- because it is hugely beneficial to his organization's members.
We are excited about free preventive services and wellness benefits and the provision that eliminates the pre-existing conditions barrier and high premiums, and it has ended a good deal of fraud that had happened within the system."
"Our goal with the ads is to create an environment where repealing the legislation or replacing it with more free-market principals is possible," he said.
"This is a multi-dimensional process that is not focused on Republicans vs. Democrats, but lawmakers who support free enterprise vs. those who instead choose big government," she said.
Drew Westen, an Emory University psychology professor who wrote "The Political Brain," said the ad debate is about much more than health care.
"Here was his signature issue in the first term that was supposed to be his strength, but his administration did a bad job selling it, and even those who benefit from the legislation don't realize they do because the Obama administration never explained it well."
"The Obama administration had this extremely naÃ¯ve idea that a good idea would sell itself, and that it was a waste of time to talk to the American people," Westen said.
No matter what decision the U.S. Supreme Court reaches on the legislation, he says, expect to see more ads on health care in the future.
