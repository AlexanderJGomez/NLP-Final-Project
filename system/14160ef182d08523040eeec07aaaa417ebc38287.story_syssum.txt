Erin Sheehan played dead while the Virginia Tech shooter went on a rampage.
He shot my German teacher and then proceeded to shoot the students in the classroom pretty thoroughly," she said.
We didn't think we were going to be able to hold it," she said.
Sheehan recently accompanied CNN to what is known as the Virginia Tech April 16, 2007 Prevail Archive -- an office space on the edge of campus where mementoes sent from across the world are temporarily warehoused.
Thousands of other letters are also kept in the archive.
She stopped and held a picture of all the victims, pointing out her slain German teacher and another classmate.
She's responsible for documenting how everyone beyond the campus dealt with the tragedy, when the world was joined by four words: "We are all Hokies."
"There are a few that I will not ever forget reading."
Fighting back tears, Kennelly said, "This job is very moving because you get something and you read it and you think, 'oh gosh, they want to share something with us somehow.
Their job is not only to remember, but to preserve, an archival collection for the university.
"It really does bother me because I still understand I could have been killed so easy, and there is no explanation why I wasn't."
