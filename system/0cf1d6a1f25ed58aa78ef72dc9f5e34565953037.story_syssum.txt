But a little while was all Twitter needed to engage in a flurry of jokes, including the creation of several parody accounts for Rusty, the red panda.
And both have connections to China: Red pandas are native to southwestern China while Snowden recently traveled to Hong Kong, off southeastern China.
The zoo had tweeted several facts about Rusty, warning zoo visitors that he is still a wild animal and would bite if cornered or scared.
Snowden made news recently for releasing information about secret surveillance programs conducted by the National Security Administration.
The United States has publicly announced it is seeking to extradite Snowden on charges of espionage and theft of government property.
Its Twitter bio also included being a fan of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, who broke the Snowden story.
Some tweets appeared to confuse red pandas with the black-and-white giant pandas, also called panda bears.
The @NationalZoo account thanked its fans on Twitter and Facebook for helping recover Rusty.
