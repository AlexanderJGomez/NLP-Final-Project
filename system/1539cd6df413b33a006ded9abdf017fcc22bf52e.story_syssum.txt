(CNN) -- Colin Montgomerie might have masterminded Europe's charge to wrest the Ryder Cup back from the United States in 2010 but a hat-trick of the continent's best players are adamant he should not be allowed to reprise his role.
Earlier, at his Nike press conference, McIlroy said: "I personally don't feel Monty has anything to gain over this.
Poulter was instrumental in Europe's comeback against the U.S. in the latest installment of the biannual team competition, as they recovered from a 10-6 deficit to retain the trophy in what was known as 'The Miracle of Medinah' in October.
His view was shared by Donald, who became the first man to top the money lists on both the European and PGA Tour in 2011.
The announcement will be made after a 15-man committee that includes Montgomerie, Clarke and McGinley meets to decide.
