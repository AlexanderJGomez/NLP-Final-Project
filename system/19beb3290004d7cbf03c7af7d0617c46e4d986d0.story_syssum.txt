Obama's image is in the last square of a collage containing portraits of the previous 43 U.S. presidents.
According to the Tennessean, a Nashville newspaper, a note on the e-mail said it was paid for by the Tennessee Republican Party, but GOP officials denied they produced it.
The senator said as soon as she found out about the e-mail, she consulted the Legislature's human resources office, then followed their advice.
And that's what you do when someone breaks the rules, you follow policy," she said.
"Keeping her on the staff would send the message that this type of behavior is condoned by the Senate Republican Caucus."
Grantham said Goforth told him she felt "very bad about accidentally sending it to the wrong list" of people.
State Rep. Johnny Shaw, D-Bolivar, a member of the black and Democratic caucuses, said Goforth should be dismissed.
I don't think she should be a part of the people who represent the state of Tennessee," Shaw said.
"The last thing we need in the state of Tennessee is to send out the impression and the image that we are still stuck in some backwater mentality and culture that feels it's OK to depict the president of the United States in that fashion," state Rep. John Deberry Jr., D-Memphis, told CNN Radio.
