New York (CNN) -- About this time last year, Kate Rigaut was surrounded by 15 of her closest relatives, heaping turkey, stuffing and two kinds of potatoes onto her plate.
But her neighbor, Christine Mahoney-Schneider, decided to stay and brave the torrents unleashed on this coastal community and others like it along the East Coast.
The "Douglas family compound," as she called it (referencing her maiden name), had been in the family for generations, serving as a gathering spot for neighborhood get-togethers and holiday festivities.
During the holidays, throngs of Rigaut's nieces and nephews squeezed onto mismatched chairs set around a cherry oak dining-room table that she inherited from her grandmother.
Still, Rigaut seemed determined to celebrate this year's holidays in the same fashion to which she was accustomed: surrounded by her family.
Undeterred, they say they plan to pile into the car Thursday and head north, joining 13 other relatives for Thanksgiving dinner in Belle Harbor at her sister's storm-battered, though still functional, home.
A red sticker on the Rigauts' old front door signifies that the city has condemned the building and plans to demolish it.
The remains of their home will now likely join the massive garbage heaps along the Rockaway shore, adding to potential health concerns.
