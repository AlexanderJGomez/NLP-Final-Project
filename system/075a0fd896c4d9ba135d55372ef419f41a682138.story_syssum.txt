Washington (CNN) -- A former employee of the National Archives was sentenced Thursday to 18 months in prison for stealing rare recordings from the government to sell on the Internet.
"These items were entrusted to the National Archives to be used by all citizens, not to be auctioned for personal profit to the highest bidder," said Rod Rosenstein, the U.S. Attorney in Maryland.
That former radio engineer, J. David Goldin, told the Washington Post he saw the listing for the Babe Ruth hunting recording when he was searching the Internet in September 2010.
"It was Ruth, and he certainly should have gotten a lot more than 34 bucks for it -- even if Ruth is blowing his nose, people will buy it," Goldin told the newspaper.
