But then, that's pantomime -- or "panto" as the British fondly refer to it -- a musical comedy unleashed across theaters every Christmas season and like nothing you've ever seen before.
Now subvert it with cross-dressing, topical references, audience participation, big song and dance routines, and you've pretty much got the idea.
"For me, there's no other part," said 68-year-old Winkler, who has been playing the Peter Pan villain since 2006, resurrecting him again at London's Richmond Theater this year.
And it's true, one of the great joys of panto is seeing the audience erupt with lines that have been passed down through generations; youngsters standing on their seats to yell "Oh yes he is!"
"It's not the kind of theater-going experience where you have to sit still and shut up and feel that you have to be very educated to understand," said professor Katherine Newey, chair in theater history at the University of Exeter.
Yes, the princip boy, the hero, that's a woman dressed up in tights and knee-high boots, slapping her thigh.
"It's the story of Peter Pan with Vaudeville in the middle -- it's like chocolate candy with this delicious melted syrup in the center," said Winkler.
Today, panto is seen as a uniquely Christmas tradition, but it wasn't always the case.
"Pantomime as we know it now really emerges in the second half of the 19th century," said Newey.
