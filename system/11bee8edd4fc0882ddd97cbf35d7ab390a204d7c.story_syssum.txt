Was he someone Dr. Oz had spoken with about a medical issue?
Shake your head in disbelief all you want, but this is far from the most ludicrous lawsuit we have seen in recent years.
She claims they failed to warn her that sitting for an extended period of time on a black bench outside the Cowboys' stadium on a hot August day could cause burns.
One suggestion was filling the toe of a pair of socks with uncooked rice.
The reasoning being that the heated socks will cause blood to be diverted to your feet, which in turn will cool the rest of your body.
The plaintiff also claims that Dr. Oz should have offered a specific warning to avoid using this remedy to people who, like him, have diabetes and hence less feeling in their feet.
Personal injury lawyers have enticed people for years with their TV commercials and ads on the walls of buses and trains telling us that if you have been wronged, you might be entitled to a big cash award or settlement.
The lawyers then file lawsuits, hoping for a quick settlement so that they can do as little work as possible before seeing their own payday.
I can understand the lure of taking a questionable case that will reap you some media coverage and money.
Worse, these reforms may prevent some truly injured people from receiving the full compensation they deserve because of caps on damages.
But even if the plaintiff does ultimately win, it still will have sent a clear message to plaintiffs' attorneys who take these legally questionable cases: If you want money, you are going to have to really earn it.
