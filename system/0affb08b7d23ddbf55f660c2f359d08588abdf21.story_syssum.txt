Rudd, who ousted Julia Gillard in a leadership election to become Prime Minister for a second time in June, was so incensed he took to Twitter to voice his displeasure to over 1.3 million followers.
In his role as a television commentator he labeled the decision "ridiculous" and was one of the thousands that retweeted Rudd's remarks.
"There was daylight between bat and ball, there was no hot spot and no noise," Warne said.
Rudd is the latest in a long line of Aussie Prime Ministers who have indulged their love of cricket.
Gillard was pictured at various cricketing events, while former premiers Bob Hawke and Paul Keating also tried to tap into their country's love of the game.
