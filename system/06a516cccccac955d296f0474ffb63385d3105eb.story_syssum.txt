According to Billboard, the Grammy-winning singer is set to return to the charts after his halftime performance on Sunday.
Last year's halftime performer, Beyonce, reportedly saw a bump in sales of her "4" album by 123%.
Zack O'Malley Greenburg from Forbes writes that the singer may see the most return in increased ticket prices and sales for his Moonshine Jungle tour.
"With the added exposure from the Super Bowl, he could easily push prices closer to the $120 average of his halftime show predecessor, Beyonce."
