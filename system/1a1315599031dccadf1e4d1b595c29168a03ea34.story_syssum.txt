The general was criticized for the way he handled the circumstances of U.S. soldier Pat Tillman's friendly fire death in Afghanistan in 2004.
The magazine's profile on McChrystal, due out Friday, depicts an angry, snarky and foulmouthed general lambasting how the war in Afghanistan is being conducted.
The journalist writes that an unnamed aide to McChrystal mocks Vice President Joe Biden.
In a statement, he called his comments "a mistake" and apologized for "poor judgment."
McChrystal would have "fresh eyes on the problem" in Afghanistan, Gates said at the time.
McChrystal has pushed a counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan intended to empower the civilian population so much that the insurgency will slowly be demoralized, fractured and defeated.
And that is why I say you have to immerse yourself in it and understand it before you can confidently assess it," he told Time.
The Times reported that McChrystal thrives on a few hours of sleep a night and often eats only one meal a day.
He said he was sorry for his role in the way the Pentagon handled Pat Tillman's death.
Tillman's mother said last year that McChrystal knew at her son's memorial service that he had died of friendly fire, but did not tell the family.
The Army did not take action against McChrystal.
