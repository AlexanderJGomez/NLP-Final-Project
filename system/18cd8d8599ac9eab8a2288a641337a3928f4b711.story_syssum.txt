"The woman is so embarrassed with her situation, and the man spoke of the fact that he never felt in his lifetime he is ever going to be able to recuperate what he's lost -- that he would never again have nice things, he would never have a nice bed, a nice house," Jolie told CNN.
The couple lives in the village of Mohib Banda, where some 70 percent of the homes were destroyed or badly damaged by the swirling floodwater, according to the UNHCR.
The death toll in the country has climbed to 1,738, the Pakistan Disaster Authority said over the weekend.
One reason relatively few people have paid attention to the suffering in Pakistan, Jolie said, may be disaster fatigue.
They are family, and lovely, lovely, hard-working people and beautiful children, and they deserve dignity and assistance, and we have to treat them with respect and try to preserve what we can of their livelihood and their future."
The Pakistani people are resilient and will move on, Jolie said, but she urged international support to help them do that.
