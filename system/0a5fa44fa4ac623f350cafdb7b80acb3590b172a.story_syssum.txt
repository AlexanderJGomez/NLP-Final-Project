(CNN) -- She's the daughter of a Beatle, fashion designer of everyone from Madonna to the British Olympic team, recipient of a medal from Queen Elizabeth, and counts Kate Moss among her friends.
Both my mum and dad [former Beatle, Paul McCartney] are known to be vegetarians, world rights activists and environmentalists, and that definitely came into my place of work.
Obviously there have been great women from Britain in design, but actually there are fewer than I thought.
I've had people say to me: "You'll never sell handbags, you don't work with leather and leather is luxury."
M: Lots of things have been around for a long time, that doesn't mean they have to stick around forever.
We're not expected to have to answer to the fact that it's not sustainable to kill that many animals for shoes and bags.
I'll always admit that it was easier for me to question people telling me I couldn't do something because I had a pretty nice place to fall back on.
I guess I got here for a reason, it wasn't because I was a woman.
