The Buffett Rule, simply stated, requires the wealthiest Americans to pay taxes at rates not less than rates paid by middle-income Americans.
So much has happened this year to focus our attention on what is fair: Obama's State of the Union address, the Trayvon Martin case, the rhetoric around the Supreme Court's review of the Affordable Care Act and Paul Ryan's proposed budget, with its cuts to services to middle- and low-income Americans.
Even in the midst of segregation, with its pervasive lack of fairness on every front, they never wavered in their lessons about fairness.
Fairness was at the heart of being a good person.
In this year's State of the Union message, Obama said, "We can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot and everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same set of rules."
How else can we explain cuts or freezes in salaries for workers and huge pay raises and bonuses for top executives?
How else can we explain how those with the most financial resources pay the lowest tax rates?
I was working as a corporate executive during the developmental stages of H.R.
Was it "only fair" because I knew the challenges and outrageous costs faced by my mother, who struggled with multiple sclerosis, or my sister, who has sarcoidosis?
It really scares me that "fair," as I know it, may have gone for good.
Snuffed out when rules change to fit the whims of those in power.
