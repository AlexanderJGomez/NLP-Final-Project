(Hence the reason why sneaker choice would be one of my great fears about this baby's diagnosis.)
I do not want to deal with Velcro versus ties or orthopedic shoes; I want to pick out the latest trends and styles for her.
This child isn't even born yet, and she has already taught me a lesson.
I can still buy her cool sneakers and shoes; we just might need to look harder for ones that offer support as well.
A little while after that, she begins wearing her new pink Nike crib shoes.
I am so happy that I was blessed with her and that she changed my views on life.
I currently organize a Buddy Walk with some other moms, and we use funds from the walk to donate care packages to families facing hospital stays due to complications of Down Syndrome.
She takes her time when most of us want her to rush, and she is always the one smiling when everyone else is melting down.
