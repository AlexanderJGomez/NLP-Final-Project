Minutes later, Lin was fighting his way out of the plane's wreckage and searching frantically for his toddler in the shallow, murky waters of the Keelung River.
The 2Â½-year-old boy made it and was in a hospital Thursday, about to be discharged from the intensive care unit as he battles pneumonia, his uncle said.
"My brother was really grateful for the rescue teams (and) the pilot," said Chris Lin.
Chris Lin said his brother told him the plane suddenly dropped after its left engine lost power.
Thirteen people were saved in the initial rescue effort but progress slowed and water had completely filled the fuselage by evening, when a crane lifted it from the water.
"I just brought a passenger up unto Huandong, and as I was getting on (the expressway), a plane flew by and hit me," he said, according to an audio recording of the call released by taxi company Crown Taxi.
"My car is completely wrecked," Chou replied, going on to explain that it wasn't a remote-controlled plane, but a manned plane.
According to the Taipei Times, Chou's family didn't believe him at first when he telephoned home to say: "I'm OK. My car got into a crash.
