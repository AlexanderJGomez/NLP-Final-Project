(CNN) -- A judge has ordered mediation in the case of a teen girl who says her family threatened to kill her for converting from Islam to Christianity.
The parents, Mohamed and Aysha Bary, could not attend the hearing in person but listened through a telephone conference as their lawyer spoke for them.
Mohamed Bary told CNN he believes a lot of false information has been circulated about the case.
The teenager, in a sworn affidavit, claims her father, 47, was pressured by the mosque the family attends in Ohio to "deal with the situation."
Another hearing is scheduled for September 29 if the family is not able to resolve the conflict through mediation.
