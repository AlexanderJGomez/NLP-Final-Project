A team of young documentary makers is hoping to burst the myth of Africa as a dangerous backwater by shining a light on some inspiring projects taking place on the continent.
"I know about some human rights violations, some wars and genocides," was the bleak answer from another woman.
The 27-year-old hopes to launch an eight-part documentary series 'My Africa Is' -- showcasing the continent through the eyes of its insiders.
Organizers are trying to crowdsource funds through the Kickstarter website and hope to start filming in October if they reach their target.
First up in the documentary series is Abuja in Nigeria -- a country that until the election of President Goodluck Jonathan last year had largely lurched from one military coup to the next.
But according to Nosereime, that's only half the story.
But the gung-ho 33-year-old appears undeterred as she takes 'My Africa Is' to a Nigeria vs Argentina football match in the capital Abuja.
Aisha admitted that if you believed the Western media, you wouldn't step foot inside Africa.
If you listened to the news everyday you'd have no hope from the bombings or corruption.
The 33-year-old said the country had come a long way since she was growing up under a military regime in the northern state of Kebbi.
