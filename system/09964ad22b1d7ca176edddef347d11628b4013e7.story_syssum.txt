From helping us pack to checking-in, and from coping with jetlag to booking a hotel once we've landed -- these handy tools can be used every step of the way.
Again with pre-registered credit card details it only took a couple of minutes to book my ticket.
To continue in the spirit of booking on the move, I tried to check-in whilst on the Heathrow Express, which was unsuccessful due to patchy signal going underground.
Every time I tried to check-in, I had to fill out my additional passenger information which took a lot of time tapping in the same information.
As I perused with patience, looking at the photos and the room features, I suddenly began to get text messages informing me how much I had spent on data roaming.
The rooms had gone after I tried to process my payment and there was no-one to complain to.
By the time I had checked in it was too late to go hunting for food and try out some restaurant apps suggestions via Twitter.
To avoid disappoint and expensive data roaming charges -- in the end I had spent $160 -- I would use apps that are quick and easy.
