This past December 31, you watched and listened as he counted backwards for yet another year, missing no numbers on the short path to 2012.
Acknowledging them is like sealing a door to youthful paradise when what's now old and obsolete is forever sexy, frisky and fun.
Between 1952 (when he was a frequent substitute for regular host Bob Horn when it was just called "Bandstand") and 1988 (the year before he yielded hosting duties in the show's final year to Dave Hirsch), Clark presided over "American Bandstand," the most enduring and iconic of television programs, on which teenagers danced to popular records and watched pop stars -- from Chuck Berry to Chubby Checker, from Bo Diddley to Bobby Darin, from Jackie Wilson to Annette Funicell -- lip-synch their hits.
First broadcast from Philadelphia, the show went from local to national in August 1957 and every weekday afternoon from that month until 1963, Bandstand was probably the only thing you saw on television between school and supper.
He had another spinoff series, "Where the Action Is," in the 1960s and soon became as unavoidable as the weather by hosting "The $10,000 Pyramid" (which grew in other versions to $25,000 and $100,000) and co-hosting with one-time Philadelphia colleague Ed McMahon, "TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes."
Even as his entertainment empire grew to include radio shows ("Rock, Roll & Remember") and restaurants ("Dick Clark's American Bandstand Grill"), he remained the personable young man keeping the party from getting out of hand.
It was only in those last years, when Clark insisted on dropping by our homes despite his frail condition, that it looked harder.
