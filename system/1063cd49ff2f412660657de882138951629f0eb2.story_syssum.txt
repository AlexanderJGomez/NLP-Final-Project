"There is strong likelihood that we have found Chelsea," San Diego County Sheriff William Gore said at a news conference.
Gardner is being held in the San Diego Central Jail on rape and first-degree murder charges, according to jail records available online Tuesday night.
He said King's parents have been informed of the discovery.
At Tuesday night's vigil, friends and family were expected to speak about King and play some of her favorite songs.
