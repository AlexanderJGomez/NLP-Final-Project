But the U.S. intelligence community is focused on one jihadist who appears briefly at the end of the video.
In the video titled "Flames of War," the jihadist first appears speaking Arabic in a classical dialect and with the ease of a native Arabic speaker, CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said.
The jihadist claims they are Syrian soldiers assigned to a 17th Division military base near the Syrian city of Raqqa, and who now, after an ISIS attack, are "digging their own graves in the very place where they were stationed."
"Clearly ISIS had a calculated step to be able to put this guy on camera," said Frank Cilluffo, a security analyst at George Washington University.
The U.S. will also compare the clues of the jihadist's language to see whether it is consistent with those individuals who are known to have gone to fight for ISIS.
"It serves as not only a powerful recruitment piece, but a stern warning to their opposition about 'flames of war' rising against them by the fighters," according to a summary by SITE.
