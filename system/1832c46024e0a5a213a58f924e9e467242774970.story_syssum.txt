(CNN) -- Concerns about the Ebola virus were heightened Sunday when a health care worker in Texas had a positive preliminary test for the disease.
Dr. Tom Frieden, the director of the CDC, told reporters Sunday that the health care worker who appears to have contracted in Ebola was infected because of a breach in protocols.
But everyone needs to be reminded that this is still a very serious illness we're dealing with and no one has a lot of experience treating it," Smith said.
"Unfortunately, the NBC crew violated this agreement and so the Department of Health Friday evening issued a mandatory quarantine order to ensure that the crew will remain confined until October 22," the New Jersey Department of Health said in a statement.
On Saturday, people arriving from the three nations hardest hit by Ebola started getting special screening, including having their temperature taken, at New York's JFK airport.
"There are a lot of lessons being learned through that to make sure that screening goes smoothly for passengers, other passengers."
Their arrival brings the total number of U.S. troops deployed in Liberia to 334, military spokesman Lt. Col. Dave Doherty said.
Sporadic Ebola infections will be unavoidable in some European countries because of direct travel from their hubs to hotspot areas in West Africa, the World Health Organization said Wednesday.
