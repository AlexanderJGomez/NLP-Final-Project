(CNN) -- She has played football at the highest level for her country, and has returned to the top of her game after a career lull, but Park Eun-seon is suffering "humiliating" scrutiny of the most personal kind.
"My heart aches and it is humiliating," she wrote on her Facebook page, according to local media.
In a statement released to CNN, the sports council said the actions of the rival clubs were an infringement on her human rights and it demanded an official apology.
The mayor of the capital Seoul, Park Won-soon, tweeted: "As the father of a daughter, I will do my best to protect Park Eun-seon's human rights," local media reported.
