(CNN) -- A victim of Washington state's notorious "Green River Killer" has been identified 29 years after her disappearance, when a relative saw a TV movie about the serial murderer in April and family members gave DNA samples to investigators, authorities said Tuesday.
The first victims turned up near the banks of the Green River south of Seattle, giving the killer his criminal nickname.
"We are grateful to finally know what happened to Sandra after all these years," the family statement said.
Also found in the area of the cemetery site were the remains of two other women, though not at the same time that Major's remains were discovered, West said.
One of those sets of remains belonged to Kimi Pitsor, and the other remains are still unidentified, West said.
