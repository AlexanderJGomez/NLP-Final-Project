"My desire is to know the whole truth and avoid the possibility of an event of this nature happening again," said Ferre.
A transition from an ERTMS-operated section to the other system happened about four miles before the train derailed on a curve near the northwestern city of Santiago de Compostela, Ferre said.
After the accident, a temporary speed limit of 30 kph was imposed on the stretch where the accident occurred and is still in place, Ferre said.
He had been qualified to travel the Ourense-Santiago stretch of track since February 2012 and was given permission to drive the kind of train involved in the crash last November.
"Shifting the responsibility of a high-speed train on to the machine operator is, from our point of view, a rather excessive responsibility," said Rosana Perez, of the Mixed Group.
This argument falls by its own weight," said Gaspar Llamazares, of the United Left group.
Minutes before the derailment, Garzon received a call on his work phone, apparently receiving instructions on the way to Ferrol from a Renfe staff member, a court in Galicia said last month.
