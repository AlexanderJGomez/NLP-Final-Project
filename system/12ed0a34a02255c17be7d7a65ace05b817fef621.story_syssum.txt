Mike Mette, a Chicago police officer, says he acted in self-defense when he punched Jake Gotthard, a student at the University of Dubuque.
According to court documents, Mette and his friends entered the house party, but decided to leave without paying the required $5 entry fee when they saw the room was mostly empty.
Gotthard claims someone in Mette's group had stolen his cell phone and he wanted it back.
"He was yelling about his cell phone, telling me if he didn't get his cell phone back he was going to beat the crap out of me.
"[Gotthard] had bruises on the side of his neck, his arms, his elbow, his shoulders, on his back, that were simply not consistent with Mr. Mette's version that he only struck him once," said Assistant County Attorney Tim Gallagher.
"It's never an easy situation when someone is sentenced to prison, particularly when it's a police officer that we have to rely on," he said.
It stinks of the pig barn," wrote Chicago Tribune columnist John Kass.
Mette is currently on unpaid leave from the Chicago Police Department and is appealing his case.
