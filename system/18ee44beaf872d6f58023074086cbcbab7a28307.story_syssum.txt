The Nevado del Huila volcano is on orange alert, meaning an eruption is probable within days or weeks, the Colombian Institute of Geology and Mining said last week.
The snow-capped Huila, the highest active volcano in Colombia, last erupted on November 20.
Gas and hot ash caused snow on the mountain peak to melt, sending mud, rocks and floodwater rushing down the Paez and destroying at least 20 homes and washing out five bridges, the presidential office said at the time.
The first documented eruption occurred in the 1500s, then it stood silent for more than 400 years, according to the Web site volcanolive.com.
Officials already are monitoring the volcano with four stations that detect seismological activity, a video camera, a communications network and a system that measures mudflow, Caracol said.
