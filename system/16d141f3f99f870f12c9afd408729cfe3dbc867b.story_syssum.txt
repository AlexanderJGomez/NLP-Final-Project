Telling people "Happy New Year" more than a week after the first of the year is like keeping your Christmas lights up until February.
Seamon-Primas told me: "In my opinion, after the first week, I stop wishing others a Happy New Year, the new year is well on its way."
The same goes for the insincerity you detect when people greet you a few days after January 1 with the question: "So how's your new year been so far?"
Even with the big religious holidays, well wishing starts before the holiday and stops with its occurrence.
Go ahead and joyfully exchange wishes of "Have a Merry Christmas" the week before the holiday through Christmas Day, but not on December 29.
Believe me, there are some odd superstitions out there that will supposedly bring you luck for the year, from kissing a loved one as the clock strikes midnight to writing your new year's wishes on a piece of paper and planting it in the ground to eating lentils or black-eyed peas on New Year's Day.
If someone does offer you such a greeting two or three weeks into the New Year, don't be rude, simply explain that it's like wishing someone Happy Valentines Day on February 18
However, even if you are reading this after January 7, I still sincerely wish you, and your family, a very happy and healthy New Year.
