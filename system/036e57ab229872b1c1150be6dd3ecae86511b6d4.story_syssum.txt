"What is taking place in Syria is not an internal issue but rather a conflict between the resistance axis on one hand and the enemies of this axis in the region and the world on the other hand, with the goal being to strike Syria's resistant role," state media quoted Jalili as saying.
Syrian State TV showed footage of Jalili and al-Assad meeting, the first video of the president that has surfaced since last month.
Jalili, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, met with al-Assad to discuss resolving the 17-month-long civil war and rescuing several Iranians who were kidnapped over the weekend in Syria.
Iran's foreign ministry is working through diplomatic channels, such as the United Nations, to get the people freed.
An Iranian Foreign Ministry official said Washington is responsible for the lives of the Iranians because the United States supports the rebels.
Clinton, meanwhile, said that the opposition "is becoming increasingly coordinated and effective," holding territory from northern Aleppo to the Turkish border and seizing regime weaponry such as tanks.
The 24 U.N. monitors in Aleppo have been temporarily pulled out of the city because of the "deteriorating security situation," a spokeswoman for the U.N.
As the violence spirals, France is proposing a ministerial meeting of the U.N. Security Council to be held on August 30, Western diplomats said Tuesday.
Roughly 17,000 people have been killed since the Syrian conflict began, U.N. Secretary-General Ban said last month.
