WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. Ted Stevens declared his innocence Tuesday after his indictment on charges that he concealed hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gifts and services from a company in his home state.
I am innocent of these charges and intend to prove that," Stevens said in a statement released by his office.
In the 28-page indictment, Stevens was charged with seven counts of making false statements on his Senate financial disclosure forms.
Stevens denied those charges, saying in the statement "I have never knowingly submitted a false disclosure form required by law as a U.S.
And I believe him," said Inouye, a Hawaii Democrat who is one of Stevens' closest friends in the Senate.
Allen is cooperating with the Department of Justice as part of his plea agreement, Friedrich said.
But I believe in the American system of justice that he is presumed innocent.
... How they handle Stevens is certainly up to them.
Stevens is the oldest Republican senator and second in age only to Sen. Robert Byrd, the 90-year-old Democrat from West Virginia.
He has represented Alaska in Washington since 1968 and is up for re-election in November.
