(CNN) -- President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt is on a mission -- to return his country to its rightful place as the "indispensable" Arab state after what he saw as the dangerous chaos of Muslim Brotherhood rule under his predecessor, Mohamed Morsy.
These two imperatives -- a sense of Egypt's historic role and the traditional animosity of the Egyptian military toward Islamist radicalism -- have propelled Egypt to take a central role in the on-off cease-fire talks to end the latest Gaza conflict.
El-Sisi shares the Israelis' loathing of Hamas, which itself sprang from the Muslim Brotherhood back in 1987 and which was recently labeled a terrorist organization by an Egyptian court.
The last thing el-Sisi wants is any sort of Hamas victory, imagined or otherwise, that would appeal to the Arab street.
Egypt faces a host of its own security problems that would only be aggravated by a strong militant presence in Gaza.
A gun battle Tuesday between security forces and suspected militants in the region of Matruh on the Mediterranean left nine dead, according to the Egyptian Interior Ministry.
He said last Saturday: "We have a real opportunity to end this conflict for once and for all but we must give the Palestinian people real hope in a Palestinian state and its capital Eastern Jerusalem."
PA President Mahmoud Abbas is all too aware of the support in the West Bank for Hamas, whose flags have been hoisted by the hundreds at recent protests.
He's the sort of Egyptian leader with whom it can do business.
But Israeli officials -- and many other observers -- believe there is another reason that el-Sisi aims to make himself the "indispensable" partner: to use that role to win much-needed international aid and credit for an economy on life-support.
And yet subsidies still eat up one-third of the national budget, while education consumes less than six per cent.
I am the most aware of the size of the problems in Egypt," he told the Post's Lally Weymouth.
