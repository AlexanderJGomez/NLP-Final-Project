Now they don't know what the future holds after Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday signed a controversial law that bans the adoption of Russian children by American families.
"We just hope everything works out so we can bring her home," Josh Johnston said in a phone interview from his home in Dover, New Jersey.
Jenni Johnston's experience volunteering for an international nonprofit had also opened their eyes to the difficulties orphans with medical conditions face in finding a family, leading them to specifically request a child who was HIV-positive.
They first saw Anastasia from a distance in the audience of a talent show and later met her face-to-face accompanied by a nurse and doctor, Josh Johnston said.
Americans tend to seek adoptions abroad because of the perception that it's easier and that there are more children in need in other countries than in the United States.
"Generally, it's perceived that orphans have far greater challenges abroad than they do in the United States, so when it comes to adopting a child, families typically want to raise a child out of a desperate situation," said Kim de Blecourt, founder of Nourished Hearts, a faith-based support network for those connected to adoption and foster care.
When Dominique Love found out she couldn't have children, she and her husband started looking abroad to avoid potential conflicts with birth parents.
The couple came across Russia as an option and ultimately found the experience to be so positive that they planned to return there to adopt a daughter.
They have also become part of a community of Russian-American families in Atlanta in an effort to stay connected to his roots.
It broke her heart and reminded her of the other children still waiting for a family to choose them, which is why she was eager to return to Russia for Hampton's sister.
We walked into that baby home and saw the number of children that need homes."
