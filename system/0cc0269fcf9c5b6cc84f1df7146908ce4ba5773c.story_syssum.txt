(Oprah.com) -- A businesswoman, a mother of four, an international fashion icon, a woman committed to making the world a better place for women and children -- Queen Rania of Jordan is truly changing the world.
When she was just 22, she went to a dinner party where she met Jordan's Prince Abdullah -- considered one of the world's most eligible bachelors.
Rania says that being queen is not the trait she defines herself by.
"The honest truth is that my life is very much about dealing with issues on the ground, dealing with ... the problems that our country faces.
When most people think of queens, they probably think of what they know from fairy tales.
I worry about the influences from their friends."
The family never discusses the possibility that Hussein, their oldest child, could be the future king of Jordan, Rania says.
For instance, to get the things they want, the children have to clean their rooms and do well in school.
"Once you feel that others are like you, then you want for others what you want for yourself," she says.
"One of the most important things you can do for a girl is empower her with her education.
Just like in America, Muna cooks a variety of meals, everything from traditional Arabic food to hamburgers and spaghetti.
This is not true as long as a woman is wearing it because of her belief.
"I would like to dispel the misconception that Arabs are all extremists, that Arab people are violent and that women in the Arab world are oppressed and suppressed," she says.
In the future, Rania says she hopes for a more open and secure world.
"We have to create opportunities for our youth so they have a chance in life," she says.
"Whenever you're frustrated and you feel like you don't have a future or you can't get a job, then you're more susceptible to be influenced by terrorism and extremist ideology."
