(CNN) -- When Iranian director Asghar Farhadi accepted his Golden Globe for best foreign film last month, he spoke a few words of thanks, paused and announced he wanted to say something about his people.
Amid the glib militarism of Republican presidential candidates, the bellicosity of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the nuclear recklessness of the mullahs, "A Separation" drives home the oft-ignored fact that Iran is full of educated, sophisticated and cultured people who don't necessarily agree with their government either.
A young mother of Tehran's educated middle-class, she wants a better life for her daughter, Termeh (played by the director's daughter, Sarina Farhadi) and -- why not?
Under her hijab, her hair is dyed an unnatural but quite chic shade of red, which more or less reflects her disposition.
That she cannot touch Nader's father, played by Ali-Asghar Shahbazi, lest she violate some religious tenet, verges on the absurdly comedic.
At a time of nationalism-cum-tribalism, and a seemingly sweaty eagerness for the United States and Iran to mix it up militarily, Farhadi's camera cultivates emotional generosity: The point of view swings from objective to subjective, capturing the emotions of the characters via their shared point of view.
It all adds up to an experience that is rare at the movies, directorially demanding and which creates the very phenomenon that makes "A Separation" unique and resonant.
