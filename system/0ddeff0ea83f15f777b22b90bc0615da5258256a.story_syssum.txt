Cairo (CNN) -- Predawn gunfire and clashes from a violent military crackdown on protesters in Cairo's Tahrir Square on Saturday left Egyptians feeling shocked, confused and angered in the hours that followed.
It is not clear whether or not they were troops engaged in the crackdown -- or whether they were some of the 15 uniformed army officers and soldiers who defied direct orders by joining a protest of tens of thousands of demonstrators in Tahrir Square on Friday.
Gen. Adel Amara, a member of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, said security personnel did not attack the protesters.
Four from the armed forces (who joined the protesters) have some bruises plus nine civilian protesters," he said.
But in the weeks since, the secretive 20-man council has produced increasing frustration and criticism from different portions of the Egyptian political spectrum.
For long intervals, they took to one of the stages erected in the crowded square and called for the country's military rulers to be replaced.
Tempers flared at one point between soldiers and citizens outside the gates of the Egyptian Museum, which has been used in past months as a detainment center by the Egyptian military.
In scenes reminiscent of street protests last January and February, activists have once again blocked entry into Tahrir, using coils of barbed wire apparently left behind by the military.
