At least 60 people were killed and more than 110 were wounded Sunday in a Lahore, Pakistan, suicide blast near the country's border with India, police said.
More than 5 kilograms (11 pounds) of explosives were used in the blast, which was conducted by a male from 18 and 20 years old, Inspector General Mushtaq Ahmad Sukhera of the Punjab police said.
The ceremony, which ends with soldiers folding their countries' flags and shaking hands, draws attendees from both sides of the border, as well as international tourists.
The "beating retreat" ceremony, as it's known, is postponed until Thursday, officials said.
