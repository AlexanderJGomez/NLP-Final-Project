Silverstone, England (CNN) -- It has taken over 20 years, but a woman was back on the track in the male-dominated world of Formula One .
"Although there has been a lot of media around my run, when it's just you in the car it's the best feeling.
"She knows the car, she's done a lot of preparation in the simulator, she's spent a lot of time with the engineers and she's perfectly competent in the car without causing any hindrance to the team.
As the wife of Mercedes executive director Toto Wolff, who also owns just over 10% of the Williams team, she has had to bat away suggestions that she owes her opportunity behind the wheel to nepotism.
"It would be naive to say that having a female on board doesn't bring you commercial benefit but everybody knows that Williams is a serious racing team," she said.
Susie was one of the very few, if not the only one, I raced against.
Wolff will get a second chance to make her mark in first practice at the next grand prix in Germany.
Asked why it had taken more than 20 years for a female racer to be given another opportunity in a competitive F1 session, Wolff told CNN: "Firstly, if there is no role model out there doing it, for all the little girls who come to the tracks and watch on TV, if they don't see a girl on track then they're not inspired to want to do that themselves.
Of the seven women to join the F1 world championship, only two have ever qualified to start a race.
The late Maria de Villota, who died in October last year, also began her F1 career along with Wolff when she was signed as a development driver by the Marussia team in 2012.
