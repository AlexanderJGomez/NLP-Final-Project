(CNN) -- Kim Jong Un, successor to his father's dictatorship over North Korea, will have to find ways to balance political factions and generate revenue -- or he may not remain in power for long, analysts said Tuesday.
It is unknown whether Kim Jong Un has the skills, knowledge or training to lead his country through the next era.
Christian Caryl, an editor of foreignpolicy.com, said the younger Kim's lack of experience does not bode well.
North Koreans "know much more about the world than they did" when Kim Jong Il came to power, said Caryl, who last visited a few years ago.
Jayshree Bajoria of the Council on Foreign Relations writes that "even with a successor, North Korean observers have for some time feared a behind-the-scenes power struggle or nuclear instability after Kim Jong-Il's death."
Seeing that it has gone smoothly so far without any bumps, we can relatively carefully speculate that the leadership is relatively well-grounded," South Korean intelligence committee chairman Kwon Young-se said Tuesday in an interview with CNN.
Depending on the balance between the new people that support Kim Jong Un and the older generation that upheld Kim Jong Il, things may not necessarily go smoothly within the leadership," he said.
