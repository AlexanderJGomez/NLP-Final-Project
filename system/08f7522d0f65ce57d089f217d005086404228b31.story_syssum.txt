Zuwarah, Libya (CNN) -- Drive west from Tripoli along the Mediterranean coast for an hour an a half, and you'll see it in the distance: the gas flare at the Mellitah Oil & Gas Company's massive processing plant in Zuwarah.
The company is hoping it can restart gas supplies before the European winter sets in.
Karim says the company's facilities in the east and west of Libya suffered minimal damage in the conflict but officials in Tripoli still have not been able to establish contact with their El Feel oil field in the south where fighting still is ongoing.
For Mellitah, Karim says, getting workers back on the job is the first challenge.
At the complex, safety supervisor Abdulbaset Montaser instructs us to wear yellow safety helmets and hands us emergency masks in case of any danger.
He quickly reassures us: "The system that we have here is a very good system and a high technology system, so for six years we don't have any problem with that.
Walking alongside the intense blue waters of the Mediterranean Sea with Mellitah's marine superintendant, Adel Sager, we gaze out at the now-empty pier where ships dock to load crude oil for export.
"Yes," he says, from many, many different nationalities and countries."
