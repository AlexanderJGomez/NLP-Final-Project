(CNN) -- With Libyan rebels on the brink of toppling Moammar Gadhafi's 42-year rule, leaders from around the world weighed in as the battle with regime forces intensified in the capital.
China hopes the situation in Libya gets stabilized as soon as possible and people can live a normal life there.
The relentless efforts of the forces of the new Libya, supported militarily by NATO and several EU member states, and countries from the region are bringing the Gadhafi regime to its end.
We urge Colonel Gadhafi to accept the will of the people, step down immediately, and avoid further bloodshed and sufferance."
If Gadhafi keeps calling for a civil war, he will be considered the only one responsible for the bloodbath," Frattini said in an interview with Italian news channel Sky Tg24.
Now is the time for all threats against civilians to stop, as the United Nations Security Council demanded.
Russian Foreign Ministry: "The latest dramatic development of the Libyan conflict apparently shows that the power in this country will be handed over to the rebel forces very soon.
Leaders of other countries should also be aware that they'll stay in power as long as they respond to demands of the people."
"At the U.N., we will ... be taking early action in the Security Council to give the new Libyan authorities the legal, diplomatic, political and financial support they need," Cameron said.
Nick Clegg, deputy prime minister: "The UK will stay the course in Libya -- protecting the Libyan people and putting them in charge of their own fate ...
Barack Obama, president: "Tonight, the momentum against the Gadhafi regime has reached a tipping point.
The people of Libya are showing that the universal pursuit of dignity and freedom is far stronger than the iron fist of a dictator."
Today they dropped I don't know how many bombs and they are dropping them indiscriminately and openly."
