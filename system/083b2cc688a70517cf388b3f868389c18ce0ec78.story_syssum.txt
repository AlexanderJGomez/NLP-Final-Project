Many of the places we visited are maintained by the National Park Service, which has made an extraordinary effort to preserve pivotal places related to the movement.
We started our road trip at Moton Field in Tuskegee, the site of one of the early battles in the civil rights movement.
The aviators were trained in every aspect of their combat aircraft, from flight to maintenance.
Moton field is a little over three miles from Tuskegee University, the only college campus in the country with a national park.
The restaurant offers a buffet of Southern favorites like okra, macaroni and cheese, banana pudding and peach cobbler at low prices.
Entering the church basement, we could visualize protest strategy meetings for the Montgomery bus boycott or the voting rights march that King presided over in this very room.
At the center, and at several museums during our trip, we met volunteers who were participants in the voting rights movement who gave us first-hand accounts of their experiences.
"I love sharing my experience with young people by letting them know how important it is to get an education and what their foreparents and other people shed their lives and blood for in order for them to have a right to vote," Glover said.
The protest was the first of three attempts to march to Montgomery and came to be known as Bloody Sunday.
