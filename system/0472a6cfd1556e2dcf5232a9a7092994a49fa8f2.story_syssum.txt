(CNN) -- The shooting death of a 21-year-old Mississippi State University student in a campus dorm room is thought to be an "isolated incident," and there is no indication others are endangered, the school's president said Sunday.
The shooting prompted the school to send out a campus-wide alert through a series of text messages.
Keenum said he could not release many details because of the ongoing investigation, led by university police and assisted by authorities from the city, county and the Mississippi Highway Patrol.
"This is the first time in our school's history that such a tragic incident has occurred, involving a student being shot on campus," he said.
"Serious emergencies happen rarely and are usually weather related -- ice storms and wind events."
