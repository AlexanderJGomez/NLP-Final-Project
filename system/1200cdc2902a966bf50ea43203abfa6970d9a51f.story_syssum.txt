San Diego, California, will be the first stop on Sunday for poet Javier Sicilia and 70 other members of Mexico's Movement for Peace with Justice and Dignity on their trek through more than 20 cities in the United States.
For the mystical poet, who has become a key player criticizing Mexican President Felipe Calderon's strategy to fight organized crime, the caravan through the United States is the latest leg of a journey that began after his son's slaying.
Authorities believe all seven victims suffocated to death, and they have accused local police of working with cartel members in the slayings.
Since then, the poet has led a series of high-profile protests uniting people from across Mexico to tell the story of the country's losses and show the faces of those who died, disappeared or were displaced because of the fight against organized crime.
They are seeds that are going to produce fruits at another moment," Sicilia says.
Since the movement began, in addition to protest marches across Mexico and meetings with top officials, there have been notable losses.
But activists like Sicilia -- who is sharply critical of Calderon's drug war strategy and the president's approach to dealing with victims of violence -- say the death toll is far higher than government estimates.
Even though Sicilia founded the movement and is its most identifiable face -- in 2011 he appeared as one of the protesters featured in Time magazine's person of the year edition -- he says he does not consider himself its leader.
After the protest through the United States ends, the poet says he is considering returning to a spiritual retreat in France, where he spent time while his children were young.
