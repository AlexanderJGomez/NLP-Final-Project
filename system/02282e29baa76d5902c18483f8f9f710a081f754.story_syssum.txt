Peterhansel suffered a puncture 30km from the end of the stage between Copiapo and Antofagasta and saw his overall lead whittled down to seven minutes 36 seconds by Gordon.
Peterhansel is a Dakar legend with three car titles and six on motorbikes, all coming before the grueling endurance event moved to South America in 2009 but he didn't enjoy his best stage on Monday.
"Gordon started three minutes before us, and 180 kilometres from here we had got to 30 seconds behind him.
He said: "There was a torrent of mud between the inspection of the reconnaissance car two days ago and today.
I am awaiting the organisers' decision: after Ullevalseter, Gon√ßalves and a few others had gone through, they took a detour, otherwise there would have been 200 vehicles trapped in the mud.
