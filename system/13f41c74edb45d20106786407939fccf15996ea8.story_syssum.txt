Arsenal's title challenge has disintegrated in the past two weeks, with a goalless draw against European hopefuls Aston Villa followed by a 3-1 home defeat by United, and Arsene Wenger's team must now face fourth-placed Liverpool on Wednesday.
But Terry, publicly backed by his club coach Carlo Ancelotti, showed on Sunday that his performances on the field have not been affected by the controversy as Chelsea's solid back four rendered Arsenal's silky passing game near impotent in the last third of the pitch.
And it was Terry who helped Drogba score the eighth-minute opening goal, heading a corner to the far post where his unmarked teammate coolly slotted the ball into the net past exposed goalkeeper Manuel Almunia.
In Sunday's other match, Birmingham City moved up to eighth place as veteran striker Kevin Phillips came off the bench to score both goals in the 2-1 win at home to Midlands rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers.
