: How to Radiate Confidence and Feel It Too" hits shelves September 10.
I looked down at the copy of the news story.
Just as I opened my mouth to speak, the set seemed to fade into a gauzy haze.
As I delivered the facts of the story, I didn't hear a thing that came out of my mouth.
I totally slipped into imagining the future and the horrible repercussions of my screwup.
Because I'm writing this today, you can tell that somehow I lived to see the sound bite that evening.
Josh's eyes were wide open, as if he really wanted to shout, "Dude!"
I wished I had a trough to douse my head in instead of a tiny Dixie cup of water.
I noticed how incredibly weak I felt, and I noisily gulped down the water the way my dog does at his water bowl after he's been chasing squirrels for an hour.
Except for feeling wiped out, I was back to sounding authoritative and in control, even tilting my head and smirking sheepishly as if to say, You'll forgive me for that little freak-out I just had.
I was standing out on the gymnasium floor, and with each leap over the garland I felt a swish!
No, I was not going to be able to shrug off the "breathing problem," as I had called it, trying to minimize its impact, even though it had completely bamboozled me on the air.
I felt as though every tourist lugging her shopping bags from the Magnificent Mile back to her hotel, every vagrant panhandling for handouts, and every pedestrian who called the city home knew I had just made a complete fool of myself.
Every time the elevator halted and the door opened I held my breath, afraid the person joining me on the ride had seen the screwup and would ply me with questions.
I learned later it bolted him upright from his viewing perch on the couch.
Instead he just nodded, and I saw the worried look on his face.
