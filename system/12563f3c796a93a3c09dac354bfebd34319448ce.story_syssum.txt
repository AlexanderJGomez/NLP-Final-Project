Given Charlie's history with cancer -- he had one of his hind legs amputated in March to get rid of a tumor -- the veterinarian recommended immediate surgery.
"It's like, 'What are we going to do?
"It's really tough to meet our bills and to have this large amount of cost for Charlie coming up, it was just really unexpected."
Between 2 million and 2.5 million dogs enter U.S. shelters each year, and between 1 million and 2 million of those are euthanized, according to estimates from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
"I've never had to choose between caring for my dogs or caring for myself," said Manning, 39.
And through that, we give them a little ray of hope."
In the four years she spent with the couple, the pooch developed a host of health issues, including vertigo, dementia and ultimately cancer.
"Having gone through a job loss myself, I thought: 'I'm really glad that we had Ladybug when we did, because we were able to afford it.
When Manning went to retrieve Ladybug's ashes from the veterinarian's office, she asked the staff whether they knew of a way to sponsor the dog of a family less fortunate.
"(On) the cover of the local paper was a story about dogs being tied to the front of shelters because people couldn't afford to keep them anymore.
When Manning founded Fairy DogParents, her goal was to help three families in her first year.
And the other was to keep another dog from going to a shelter since that system is already stressed enough as it is."
"And the dog owner is responsible for at least 15% of the cost."
"A lot of the people that we sponsor ... have already lost so much that the one thing they try to hang on to is their dog," Manning said.
Oftentimes, families who turn to Manning's group are facing life-and-death scenarios related to their dogs.
"It was just such a blessing, and we'll be forever grateful that Charlie gets this second chance."
The dog doesn't even know we exist, and we're just making sure it gets to the ball."
