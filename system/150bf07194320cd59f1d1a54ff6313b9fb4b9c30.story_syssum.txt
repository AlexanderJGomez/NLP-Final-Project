The 29-year-old is a development driver for Williams F1, where she works with engineers in a simulator and on track tests.
My dad had a motorbike dealership and my mother met my father when she went to buy her first bike.
Big break: The Young Driver of The Year award is a very prestigious award in Great Britain and I was the first ever female to make the final six.
(Team founder) Frank Williams was always very interested in the fact that one of his board members (Wolff's husband, Toto Wolff) had a wife who raced.
I do a lot of back and stomach exercises and for the braking I need to have quite strong legs as well.
Blazing a trail: I don't race to prove how good women can be against men.
Many girls who are really interested in motorsport watch Formula One and see no females there, so maybe they don't understand what they could do.
Bikinis: It's a very fine line: I'm representing a car manufacturer and all the sponsors so of course you have to make an effort to look nice at the racetrack.
I don't think my mother's ever watched the start of any of my races -- she gets nervous because that's when big accidents can happen -- but she's very supportive.
She devoted herself to him and I think she had an incredible strength.
As I put down the phone, it rang and it was Mercedes Benz.
If you wake up every morning and are motivated and ambitious to achieve your goals, that gives you the best feeling in life.
Relaxation: I like to just chill out with my husband and go for nice dinners.
Away from the racetrack, I'm a normal wife.
