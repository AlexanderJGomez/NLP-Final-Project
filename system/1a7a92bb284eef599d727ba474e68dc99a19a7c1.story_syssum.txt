A privacy group, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, had sued the TSA claiming the machines violated Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches.
But another, more likely scenario is that TSA, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, will go through the public comment and rule-making process.
But, the court noted, "many passengers ... remain unaware of this right, and some who have exercised the right have complained that the resulting pat-down was unnecessarily aggressive."
"It is clear that by producing an image of the unclothed passenger, an (Automated Imaging Technology) scanner intrudes upon his or her personal privacy in a way a magnetometer does not," the court noted.
"I think the court would have had a very different conclusion" had body scans been mandatory, Rotenberg said.
