Andy Murray's bid to become the nation's first Wimbledon men's singles champion since 1936 was derailed, while the England football team suffered penalty-shootout heartache at the recent Euro 2012 tournament.
"It is Bradley Wiggins' Tour de France to lose," according to former British cyclist and now commentator Paul Sherwen, who made his debut in the race in 1978.
Earlier this year, the Belgium-born rider became the first man to win the Paris-Nice, Tour de Romandie and Criterium du Dauphine stage races in the same season, while also embarking on a number of high-altitude training camps to prepare his body stands for the rigors of the French cols in the Alps and the Pyrenees.
Gold medals from Wiggins in the 4km individual pursuit and the team pursuit on the track in Beijing propelled Britain to the top of the cycling medal table four years ago.
"Nowadays, the Americans have professional teams, we've now a got a British team on the international circuit and the Australians have got their own professional team.
I'm not saying it's easier, but, in English soccer, you've got Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool and you can dream of playing for one of those teams as a kid.
After the culmination of the Tour on Paris' Champs Elysees on July 22, Wiggins will turn his attention to a home Olympic Games in London where he will compete in the time trial event.
"If Bradley could win the Tour de France this year it would be absolutely huge," said Sherwen.
