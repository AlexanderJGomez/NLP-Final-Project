(CNN) -- Two Gonzaga University students could be suspended or even expelled after using a handgun to defend themselves from an intruder in their university-owned apartment, an act which the university says violates the school's weapons policy.
Because the apartments are owned by Gonzaga, both police and campus security responded when Fagan and McIntosh called 911.
He added that the pistol that was used in the incident belonged to McIntosh, and was a gift to him from his grandfather several years ago.
In a disciplinary board hearing on Friday, the board, made up of three faculty members and two students, found Fagan and McIntosh guilty of two infractions -- possessing weapons on school grounds and putting others in danger by the use of weapons, according to Chuang.
The other, he said, was aware of the policy but didn't think it applied to him because the apartment isn't on campus.
McCulloh's statement said he has asked the Vice President for Student Development to work with several campus organizations to "facilitate a campus dialogue focused on this issue."
