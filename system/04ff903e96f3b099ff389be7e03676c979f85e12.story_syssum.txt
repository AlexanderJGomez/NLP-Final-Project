ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Nearly two dozen Americans -- most thought to work for the CIA -- were sentenced to five years in prison Wednesday by an Italian court for their role in the seizing of a suspected terrorist in Italy in 2003, the prosecutor in the case told CNN.
He was seized on the streets of Milan, Italy, in 2003, transferred to Egypt and tortured, he said.
A total of 22 Americans were each sentenced to five years in prison for their role in his abduction.
Two other Italians were sentenced to three years in jail for aiding the plot.
But at the end of the day, representatives of our United States government abroad were let down and left alone by their own government."
The Pentagon had asserted jurisdiction over the incident under the NATO Status of Forces Agreement, a position that the Italian minister of justice supported, Morrell said.
"The decision in Italy underscores the need for the United States to hold its own officials accountable for crimes committed under the 'extraordinary rendition' program.
Former CIA analyst Michael Scheuer told CNN in the past that the Italian military secret service had approved the operation involving Hassan, and CIA sources who refused to be named told CNN in 2005 that the agency had briefed and sought approval from its Italian counterpart for such an abduction.
Berlusconi has since returned to power.
