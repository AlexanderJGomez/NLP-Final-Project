But despite struggling with the airline for months, Carroll turned down the money because he wanted something bigger: he wanted to reform the system.
Rants abound on video sharing sites; many feature nothing more than the offended party on a webcam spinning a tale of woe.
One Atlanta couple, Ken and Meredith Williams, recently learned first hand how this mix of outrage and humor can get the public on your side and sway a large corporation.
Their story starts about six months ago when the newlyweds found themselves in a rather intractable situation trying to buy their first home.
They say paperwork wouldn't make it to the correct office, phone calls and e-mails would go unreturned.
So after missing the projected closing date, with fees beginning to pile up and only radio silence from the bank, they turned their in-boxes into a weapon.
"I just thought we just have to do something -- there is some kind of power we can leverage" Meredith says.
With that, their hopeless situation, weeks of unreturned phone calls and volumes of paperwork came to a close.
As the couple walk through, they sound like many new homeowners pointing out all the projects.
Francisco did apologize for other hang-ups in the Williams' case, and he said the couple's experience prompted "a tightening of procedures" at the bank.
Looking back, both the Williamses and Carroll say the intent behind the video is as important to getting noticed as the message.
But even if a viral video doesn't get you want you want, all three say the process affords a measure of control -- something they'd lost in what Carroll calls the "customer service maze" and Meredith called the "black hole of customer service."
It also doesn't hurt to be good with a guitar.
