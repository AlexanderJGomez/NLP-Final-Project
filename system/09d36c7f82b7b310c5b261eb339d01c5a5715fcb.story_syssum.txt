The American made a smooth transition from the London grass courts -- which she will return to for the Olympics later this month -- and an eight-hour time difference as she beat college champion Nicole Gibbs 6-2 6-1 in the second round of the hard-court event.
"When I played Monica Seles for the first time it was pretty cool.
"It was a great experience -- it was really good to match up against that level and see what's out there," said Gibbs, who was appearing in the main draw of a WTA Tour event for the first time.
"Serena will definitely be a challenge, but I'm ready to go out and just enjoy it," said Scheepers, who lost to Williams in straight sets in their only previous meeting.
