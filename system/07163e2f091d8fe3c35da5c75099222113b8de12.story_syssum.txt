In 2012, the Affordable Care Act barely survived a constitutional challenge when Chief Justice John Roberts stunned conservatives and voted along with the court's four liberal justices to uphold the law.
Currently 16 states plus the District of Columbia have set up their own exchanges; the remaining 34 states rely on exchanges run by the federal government.
They say the IRS -- one of the agencies charged with implementing the law -- was wrong to offer tax credits to individuals who live in states that only have federally run exchanges.
The challengers say that Congress limited the subsidies in order to encourage the states to set up their own exchanges.
Carvin stressed that even though the case is "socially consequential" and "politically sensitive," the court must look at what precisely the law says.
Verrilli said it was "abundantly clear" that some states would not establish their own exchanges and that if the challengers win, those living in states with federally facilitated exchanges would "face the very death spirals the Act was structured to avoid."
Enrollment for 2015 is still in progress, but in court briefs the government said that nearly 7 million customers have selected or been re-enrolled in a plan through a federally facilitated exchange and "coverage throughout the exchanges is expected to continue to increase substantially in the coming years."
Although the lower courts dismissed the government's argument that the plaintiffs didn't have standing, the media and others have uncovered information that could raise new questions.
It turns out, for example, that two of the plaintiffs are veterans and could be eligible for health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs, though they signed a declaration swearing that they weren't eligible for government insurance.
