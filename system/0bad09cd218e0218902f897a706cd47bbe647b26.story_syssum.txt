"I misled the American people," Jackson, 48, said before U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson imposed the term, which also included an order for restitution and community service.
The pair pleaded guilty in February to various charges -- Jackson to one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud, and false statements; and his wife to filing false tax returns.
Today I manned up and tried to accept responsibility for the error of my ways," he said before climbing into a waiting vehicle.
Sandi Jackson sobbed through part of her courtroom statement and said she "put her family unit in peril" for filing false tax returns.
Prosecutors had sought a four-year sentence for Jackson and 18 months in jail and restitution of $168,550 for his wife.
Jackson's lawyers pointed to his record in Washington -- one they said was good -- in arguing for a lighter sentence.
"The real remorse you've shown is palpable in this courtroom," she said.
Jackson will begin his sentence around November 1 at a prison camp in Montgomery, Alabama, the judge said.
In addition to jail time, Jackson must repay in full the money he misused, while his wife was ordered to make restitution of $22,000.
Jackson served in the House of Representatives from 1995 until 2012, when he took a medical leave of absence and never returned.
Although Jackson never lived up to that hype, he was an extremely vocal supporter of then-candidate Barack Obama.
"I'm sure that Dr. King is looking down on us here in Denver noting this is the first political convention in history to take place within sight of a mountaintop," Jackson said in 2008, referencing the Rev.
Outside the courtroom, Jackson Sr. told reporters that his son was "unbelievably sick" a year ago, but is now doing better.
