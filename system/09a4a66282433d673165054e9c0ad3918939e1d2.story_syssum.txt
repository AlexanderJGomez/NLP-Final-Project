But the U.S. gains have been boosted by government incentives, including provisions of the 2009 economic stimulus package, that are due to disappear within two years, said Phyllis Cuttino, director of Pew's clean energy programs.
And while U.S. investors have been ponying up while the incentives are in place, much of that money is going into projects overseas -- and America is importing the resulting products.
The Germans added more than 7 gigawatts of solar energy capacity in 2011, while Italian investments grew by nearly 40% to $28 billion.
Germany and China have boosted their green energy sector "through consistent policies," by setting targets for new generating capacity, the report said.
Cuttino said companies are going to fail as the renewable power industry grows, comparing it to the early years of the automobile industry.
"There were over 100 companies trying to make cars at the turn of the century," she said.
