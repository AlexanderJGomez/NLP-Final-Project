On Tuesday afternoon's epsiode of "Anderson Live," host Anderson Cooper told viewers he sunburnt his eyes on a recent trip to Portugal, and was subsequently blind for 36 hours.
"We have sunscreen we can put on our skin, but we don't have eye drops that offer a protective film for the cornea, so it is really important that everyone, and especially people with fair or light eyes, wear sunglasses that protect against both UVA and UVB rays," says Sarnoff.
When it is burned by the sun's rays, the cornea becomes inflamed -- an effect called keratitis -- which can be quite painful and, as in Cooper's case, can cause temporary blindness.
Thankfully, with numbing and antibiotic eye-drops, it only takes a couple days to recover.
Even during the winter, you should protect your eyes from dangerous rays -- particularly when they are reflected off bright surfaces such as snow.
