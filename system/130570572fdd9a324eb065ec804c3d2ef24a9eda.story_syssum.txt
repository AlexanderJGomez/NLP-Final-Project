Sent by my 25-year-old daughter, the announcement shocked me but soon triggered fond memories of the days when she and her younger sister would belt out Houston's latest hit along with the radio.
A few of the high notes were clearly out of my girls' easy reach in their spontaneous renditions.
And the sheer stamina it took to achieve this elusive aspect of a singer's art separates the wannabes from the real McCoy.
What was remarkable is that she hardly ever "bailed out" by flipping into a falsetto voice -- you know, that head-buzzing sound that men emit when they're doing bad imitations of female opera singers.
Beyond the gift of her instrument, Houston's musicianship comprised an uncanny way of handling the material she was given with such expertise and attention to detail that the songs became hers and hers alone.
She mostly executed them in clever twists at the ends of phrases or tossed them off with stunning ease between plainly rendered melodic statements.
Her exquisite beauty together with that "come hither/don't take another step closer or I'll call my cousin" camera presence intrigued us.
In the end, the voice just couldn't keep up with the extravagances and toils of her life in the spotlight.
