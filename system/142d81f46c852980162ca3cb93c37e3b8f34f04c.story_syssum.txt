AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (CNN) -- The nationalities of the people killed in the Turkish Airlines plane crash near Amsterdam's main airport have been identified as five Turks and four U.S. citizens.
Investigators were trying to determine what caused the crash of the aircraft, a model with a good safety record flown by a well-respected airline at one of the world's most modern airports.
Authorities have confirmed the nationalities of all but 15 of the passengers and crew, Weterings said.
Turkish Airlines posted a statement on its Web site on Thursday saying it takes safety seriously and that it followed all "maintenance procedures of the plane manufacturer, national and international authorities directives" for the plane.
In the wake of the disaster, Turkish Airlines executives and officials from Turkey's Transportation Ministry said the Boeing 737-800 had last been inspected December 22.
The relatives were accompanied by trauma specialists, the airline said.
Aviation experts say Turkish Airlines has a relatively good safety record, though in 2003, more then 70 people were killed when a Turkish Airlines domestic flight crashed in fog near the southeastern city of Diyarbakir.
An employee in Turkish Airlines' advertising department said the promotional campaign was suspended in the wake of the fatal plane crash.
