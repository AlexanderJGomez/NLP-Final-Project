SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- Opponents of California's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriages launched a new court challenge Wednesday, led by lawyers who were on opposite sides of the case that settled the 2000 presidential race.
"Our Constitution guarantees every American the right to be treated equally under the law," Boies said.
California's Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the marriage ban Tuesday, but left intact about 18,000 same-sex marriages conducted before voters approved the ban in November.
In another echo of past political battles, one of those who argued in favor of Proposition 8 was Kenneth Starr -- the special prosecutor who led the Whitewater investigation that led to the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton.
"Pushing the federal government with multiple lawsuits before we have a critical mass of states recognizing same-sex relationships or suing in states where the courts aren't ready is likely to lead to bad rulings," the coalition said.
The suit filed by Boies and Olson cites heavyweight Supreme Court precedents such as Brown v. Board of Education, the 1954 decision that banned segregation in public schools, and Loving v. Virginia, the 1967 ruling that struck down state laws banning interracial marriage.
"We're going to court because people shouldn't have to surrender their fundamental rights to a popular plebiscite," Olson said.
