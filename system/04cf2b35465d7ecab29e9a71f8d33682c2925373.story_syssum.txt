(CNN) -- Global debate over the Syrian crisis is expected to ratchet up this week, with Russian and European Union leaders grappling with the thorny issue and U.N. members reassessing whether to take further action.
China and Russia are the only members of the council that have repeatedly barred attempts to formally condemn the Syrian government.
"Based on our own investigation, we have determined that the U.N. observer mission has consciously provided the regime with political cover.
"Since the beginning of the uprising, the regime has systematically resorted to lies, claiming the existence of Islamic fundamentalists, Palestinian gunmen and terrorists as part of a vile foreign conspiracy to change the power structure and its relationship to society," the LCC wrote.
"Truthfully, even monsters do not do what we saw, especially in the Houla massacre," he told lawmakers.
His speech came more than a week after the U.N. Security Council condemned the Houla massacre, with members casting blame on government forces for the deaths.
At a meeting of Arab League foreign ministers Saturday, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabor Al Thani said Annan's peace initiative should be placed under Chapter VII of the U.N. charter, Qatar's news agency reported Saturday.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Sunday that he had taken note of the Arab League leaders' suggestions, including requests to increase the number of U.N. observers and to set a time limit for the effort.
CNN cannot independently confirm reports of casualties or violence from Syria because the government restricts access to foreign journalists.
