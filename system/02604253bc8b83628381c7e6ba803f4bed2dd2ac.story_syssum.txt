(CNN) -- Millions of people are expected to go to Washington to celebrate Barack Obama's inauguration on January 20, but with a troubled economy and pocketbook issues on the mind, the president-elect must be careful to set the right tone.
Obama has promised to "take power away from the corporate lobbyists" -- a pledge that would be questioned should the president-elect rely on them to foot his inauguration bill.
But analysts say Obama's not expected to go that far because so many people want to celebrate his historic win.
The tickets are supposed to be free, but with demand outpacing supply, a traditional giveaway has turned into a thriving online marketplace.
Organizers of the inauguration say it violates the spirit of the event and could spell disappointment for people who buy tickets for the ceremony.
