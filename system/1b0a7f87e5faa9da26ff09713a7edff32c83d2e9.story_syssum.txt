Between June and August this year, China plans to launch its manned Shenzhou-9 spacecraft and then rendezvous and dock with a space lab which has been orbiting the earth since September.
If all goes as planned, China will become only the third nation, next to the U.S. and Russia, to dock capsules in space.
The Chinese exploration plans, announced in December, come as the United States has been scaling back its plans and funding for space exploration.
"Every serious analyst understands that the Chinese are going all out to dominate space," Gingrich said.
Chinese officials speak of a three-step manned space flight plan: send man into orbit, dock spacecraft together to form a small space lab, and ultimately build a large space station.
Over the years, it has upgraded its launch vehicles, built new spaceflight facilities and trained a stable of astronauts.
Before that, China's space program was largely seen as capable but lacking in sophistication.
They struck me as quite unassuming in their white wrinkled robes that made them look MORE like doctors in a hospital ward than aerospace experts.
Over the years, China has been vying for a bigger slice of the lucrative satellite-launch market.
Experts say the Chinese could use the station to conduct biological, genetic and energy research.
"A rapidly developing space industry does not mean China has renounced its commitment to peace," says Qi Faren, the chief designer of the Shenzhou spaceship series.
If the trajectory remains unchanged, experts say, China's space activities may well surpass those of Russia and the European Space Agency within a decade or so.
