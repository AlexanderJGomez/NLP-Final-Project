Arpaio responded by telling reporters he had "an idea of the politics involved in law enforcement" after 28 years of working with the U.S. Justice Department as a law enforcement official in Mexico, South America, Texas and Arizona.
For example, the sheriff apparently endorsed one constituent's letter asking for a "round-up" at one Phoenix street corner of "dark-skin(ned)" people: Arpaio told a member of his command staff in a note to "(h)ave someone handle this," the Justice Department said.
"But I will tell you one thing: enforcing the law overrides my compassion.
Arapaio and his attorneys declined to comment on the specific allegations, but lawyer John Masterson said: "I think it was a foregone conclusion of what they're going to find, and they ended up finding it.
It further blamed the office for allowing "specialized units to engage in unconstitutional practices" and for a lack of oversight and deputy training.
"The problems are deeply rooted in (Maricopa County Sheriff's Office) culture, and are compounded by (its) penchant for retaliation against individuals who speak out," added Perez, who said authorities were also looking at allegations of excessive force and a deliberate failure to provide law enforcement services in select communities.
It is time to bring the community together around the shared vision of a department that is effective in reducing crime, respects the rule of law and enjoys the confidence of everyone," Perez told reporters.
He's also a well-known and controversial personality, running for his sixth term as sheriff.
