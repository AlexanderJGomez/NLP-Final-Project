Affordable Art Hong Kong, a spinoff of the original event launched in London in 1999, attracts art enthusiasts from all walks -- and wallets -- of life, with original works on sale from unknowns and well-knowns at the more than 120 galleries represented from around the world.
A section on Hong Kong's young artists appealed to local tastes, while an "Under HK$10,000 Wall" catered to the art collector on a tighter budget.
Compared to Zeng Fanzhi's "The Last Supper," which auctioned at Sotheby's 40th Anniversary Sale in Hong Kong last October for a record HK$180.4 million ($23.3 million), everything under HK$100,000 seems like a steal.
"The purpose is to democratize art -- to open it up to a much wider audience who wouldn't normally have the opportunity to see fantastic works on display," says Paul Matthews, director of development and global partnerships for the fair.
