Russell is familiar with how women are portrayed in the media.
To celebrate Interrupt magazine's launch, she's inviting the public to an art lab called "You Are a Genius" on New York's Lower East Side through Monday.
At the Big Bad Lab, we build participatory art and media platforms for causes, communities and organizations we care about.
We knew it's crazy to start another media platform, but we came across many authentic voices online and offline that we felt we can bring together and showcase.
We collaborated with Interrupt photographer Marie C. who interviewed girls under the age of 8 asking what they liked about their bodies.
Instead of the usual negative views -- I'm too fat or I don't like my nose -- these girls appreciated the fact that they can draw with their hands and run fast with their legs.
But when we posted her advice to our Tumblr site it became one of the most popular stories.
Starting this week, it is appearing for free in nail salons, newsstands, dentist offices and other not-so-hidden places around NYC.
We wanted to build a space where people felt comfortable and genius in their identity.
Russell: The first several hundred submissions came from people who found out about the project online, mostly through Twitter.
Russell: There are a ton of new media startups heavily focused on getting huge traffic and high growth, but that's not our central goal.
But as I learned more about our democracy, I realized that who participates, who votes and who gets elected is not as simple as it seems.
That got me interested in how to bring people together and ignite alternative networks of power, and that's why I started the Big Bad Lab.
When I saw her photos, I knew she was perfect to do our dream selfie wall background.
