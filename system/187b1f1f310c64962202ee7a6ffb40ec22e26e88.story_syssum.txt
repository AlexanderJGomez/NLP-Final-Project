Members of the Writers Guild of America manned picket lines Monday morning outside NBC studios at Rockefeller Plaza, carrying signs and yelling, on the first day of the Writers Guild of America's strike against studios and production companies.
A last-day effort to reach a new work agreement collapsed Sunday night despite the writers conceding a demand for a doubling of how much they are paid for DVD sales.
While studios have been hoarding scripts for months in anticipation of a strike, some television shows that are more topical -- particularly late-night TV talk shows -- are expected to immediately go to reruns.
"It's affecting us in the most visible way possible," John Oliver, a writer and correspondent for "The Daily Show," told CNN on Monday as he stood amid the pickets, who carried signs that read "On Strike" and "Pencils Down."
On Sunday night, the president of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) criticized the WGA negotiators for walking out of the talks.
The union's statement early Monday morning said that while it chose to withdraw its DVD proposal -- which they say would have doubled writers' residuals -- the studios and production companies were still insisting on a framework concerning Internet distribution that "makes a mockery of any residual," the statement said.
"American Idol" and other hit shows should not be affected by a prolonged strike.
Because of their topical nature, networks do not typically shoot these shows in advance.
But networks would have to resort to reruns, news programs and reality shows to fill the schedule in 2008 if a strike were to drag on.
