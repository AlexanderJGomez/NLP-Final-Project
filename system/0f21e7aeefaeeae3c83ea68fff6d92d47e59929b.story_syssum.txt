U.S. analysts said it's not knowable from the video released by ISIS who carried out Foley's killing, because the entire slaying is not shown.
Peter Westmacott, British ambassador to the United States, said Sunday that British agents have been using "very sophisticated technologies, voice identification and so on" to identify the suspect.
There is only one voice heard on the audio track.
The second militant appears on the video after an obvious edit.
The video contains other data like the measurements of a face, even though it is hidden.
When trying to determine whether the British-accented man is also the killer, it helps to examine where his pistol is holstered.
But the executioner appears on the video to be left-handed.
He believes the clues show the video was recorded south of the town of Raqqa in north central Syria.
