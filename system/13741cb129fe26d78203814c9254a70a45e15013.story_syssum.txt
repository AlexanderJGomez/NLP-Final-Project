Hours later, local television reported a car bombing in north Jakarta, but that report was immediately contradicted by various other media sources.
Police sealed off the area around both hotel blasts, one in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel and the other at the J.W.
"What I can say is one of the most damaged areas that we looked at, where the bodies were, was a lounge area in the Marriott near the lobby," he said.
At the Ritz, windows were blown out on the second floor, as though the blast occurred from inside a hotel restaurant that would also have been crowded with a breakfast crowd, said witness Greg Woolstencroft.
"There was a boom and the building shook, and then subsequently two more," said hotel guest Don Hammer, who was leaving his room in the Marriott when the blast occurred.
"I also noticed that there were a number of injured people being taken off to hospital, but I only noticed one dead person at this point and time, that's all I saw.
There has been extensive damage to both buildings, and at this point and time of course all the authorities are blocking up all the area and starting an investigation."
Towriss said the Marriott has beefed up security since the 2003 attacks, making it impossible for people to drive up to the hotel in cars.
"I always thought I was safer at the Marriott because I thought it had already been bombed once," Towriss said.
