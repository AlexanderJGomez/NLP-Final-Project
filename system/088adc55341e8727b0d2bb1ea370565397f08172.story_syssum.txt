(CNN) -- Colombia's president says devastating flooding forced him to cancel his scheduled trip to the United Nations climate change conference in Mexico this week -- even though global warming itself could be causing the disaster his country faces.
Better weather on Monday helped rescuers, but there was so much water on the ground that further mudslides were a risk, he said.
The landslide occurred Sunday afternoon, while volunteers elsewhere in the province of Antioquia held a telethon to raise money for winter weather victims.
