From its twisted opening scene, where a floor of coked-up boiler-room meatheads toss dwarfs for bacchanalian sport, the feverishly paced film is hell-bent on making the audience feel like they just snorted a Belushian mountain of blow.
Based on Wall Street evil genius Jordan Belfort's 2007 memoir about getting insanely rich from conning investors, "Wolf" stars Leonardo DiCaprio as an amoral Horatio Alger with a rolled C-note up his nose.
He proves to be such a born salesman that in no time he and his merry band of macho Bayside, Queens, goombahs (led by a terrific Jonah Hill as Belfort's bucktoothed loose-cannon sidekick) have more money than they know what to do with.
As bad judgment and paranoia take hold and the high rollers get careless about stashing their loot in Swiss banks, "Wolf's" pace never stops panting.
Still, Scorsese has pulled off something tricky with "Wolf": He's given us a thrilling cautionary tale about a guy who never for a second seems the slightest bit sorry for what he's done.
