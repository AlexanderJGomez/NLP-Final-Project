CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- With the retirement of Justice David Souter, President Obama has the opportunity to bring a special kind of diversity to the Supreme Court: the diversity of broad and varied governmental experience.
Yet the homogeneity of the work résumés of the current justices is unprecedented.
(Although Souter once served as a state attorney general, that is an appointed office in New Hampshire.)
Traditionally, the Supreme Court has been composed not only of former judges, but also lawyers who have come directly from serving as senators, governors, Cabinet members, heads of administrative agencies, and even from private practice.
The implied promise is that the technical proficiency of an Ivy League-trained federal appellate judge somehow trumps issues of ideology.
With all the justices coming from the federal appellate bench and eight of them having attended Harvard or Yale, did this help achieve consensus?
The best example of how there is no single "judge's answer" to Supreme Court issues can be found in the eight death penalty cases decided during the 2006 term.
In order to decide the great legal issues before the court, a justice needs to bring more than mere legal competence; a justice also needs to bring real-world experience, values and intuition.
Obama should cast the widest possible net to find a person who can bring a fresh set of experiences and perspectives to the work of the Supreme Court.
