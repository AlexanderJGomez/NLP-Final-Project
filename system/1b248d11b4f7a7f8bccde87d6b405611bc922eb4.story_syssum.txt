(CNN) -- Amnesty International is demanding the United States stop allowing the export of arms and riot-control material to Egypt, where security forces have cracked down on protests.
He said an ongoing export license has recently expired, but a shipment of tear gas was delivered to Egypt last week.
Every few minutes, the police fired canisters of tear gas back at the demonstrators.
One of the tear gas canisters had markings clearly identifying it as having been manufactured in Jamestown, Pennsylvania.
