Anti-abortion protesters plan demonstrations this weekend outside Dr. LeRoy Carhart's clinic in Bellevue, Nebraska.
It's been nearly three months since Tiller, one of the world's most well-known doctors performing abortions, was shot in the head at point-blank range on May 31 as services began at Reformation Lutheran Church in Wichita, Kansas.
Operation Rescue President Troy Newman has vowed a peaceful demonstration and said that any hints of possible violence are ginned up by what he calls left-wing groups and the liberal media.
Newman said earlier, "I'm not interested in putting our folks in any situation where the other side might flare up.
"Shooting someone in the head in a church," he said, "is not a pro-life act.
He said he was confident his organization would have shut down Tiller this summer through a legal battle.
Carhart has vowed to open an office in Kansas and said he'll keep doing abortions as long as he's healthy.
Staring across the room at a poster of Tiller, he said, "I don't want his death to be in vain.
The outside of his office has the name of his clinic in bold letters: Abortion & Contraception Clinic of Nebraska.
He stood outside his truck in Wichita adorned with a poster showing the dismembered hand of a fetus on a quarter.
Stop the killing, stop committing such a horrible act for money."
"When they're ready to accept our position, then we'll sit down.
