Palestinians distribute U.N. food aid Thursday in a refugee camp in southern Gaza.
Ging expressed frustration with the Israeli military, which he said cleared the convoy to travel into Gaza.
"If they give us the clearance to move, it is [unacceptable] that their soldiers are firing on us from the ground."
The absence of foreign journalists -- whom Israel has barred from entering Gaza -- is preventing the truth about conditions there from getting out, Ging said.
The Israeli military says its operation is aimed at halting the firing of rockets into southern Israel by Hamas, which has controlled Gaza since 2007.
But militants have continued to fire dozens of rockets and mortar shells on southern Israel since Israel launched its military operation.
Israel has periodically opened some of its borders with Gaza to allow aid into the territory during the military campaign.
Video shot from the border showed the home -- with two white flags flying on the roof -- crumble to the ground as the bulldozers plowed into its side and roll over the debris.
A three-hour truce on Wednesday was also marred by fighting which Israeli officials said were in retaliation for Hamas attacks on Israeli forces.
Hezbollah has kept a tight rein on its forces in southern Lebanon since the cease-fire following its war with Israel in 2006.
