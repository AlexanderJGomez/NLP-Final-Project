Stephanie Parente, 19, was found dead along with her sister and parents in a Baltimore hotel Monday.
The family was from Garden City, New York, but Stephanie Parente was a student at Loyola College in Baltimore, and police said the family visited her there occasionally.
The bodies were found Monday after a housekeeper told hotel management about 3 p.m. that the door to the room was locked and there had been no response from inside, county police spokesman Bill Toohey said Monday.
The bodies of Betty Parente and the two daughters were found on a king-size bed in the hotel room, while William Parente's body was found in the bathroom, police said.
Police have not specified the murder weapon, although several objects in the room are being investigated, he said.
Hill said police believe the family was together Sunday morning for breakfast, and they know what time the card key was last used to unlock the room.
Johnson urged people having emotional and mental health difficulties to reach out for help.
