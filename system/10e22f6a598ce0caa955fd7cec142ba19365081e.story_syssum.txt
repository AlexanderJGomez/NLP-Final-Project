Fear over Ebola is growing as international leaders and health organizations struggle to try to stop the deadly epidemic in West Africa.
In fact, the U.S. Department of State announced Friday that it is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to bring home two U.S. citizens who have been infected by Ebola in Liberia.
"It is the largest in terms of numbers of cases and deaths.
These cities have international airports, which opens up the possibility of infected patients traveling abroad.
The outbreak is "taking place in areas with fluid population movements over porous borders, and it has demonstrated its ability to spread via air travel, contrary to what has been seen in past outbreaks," Chan said.
The decision was ultimately that of Samaritan's Purse, Frieden told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta.
"Our role at CDC is to make sure in the transportation and in the care, any risk of infection to others is kept to the absolute minimum," Frieden said.
Frieden said that in the past, five people have arrived in the United States with other types of hemorrhagic fever; in all five cases, the patients were treated in hospitals, and no secondary infections occurred.
The State Department said the two citizens would be evacuated in the "coming days."
When it arrives, the plane will land at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Georgia, about 20 miles from the CDC's Atlanta headquarters, a Pentagon spokesman said.
"Emory University Hospital physicians, nurses and staff are highly trained in the specific and unique protocols and procedures necessary to treat and care for this type of patient," the statement said.
Ebola can last two to three weeks, so patients would remain in isolation until their symptoms subside and tests come back negative for the virus.
And two, experts say our health care system would be able to identify and contain the virus swiftly.
A well-known doctor fighting Ebola in Sierra Leone died this week after contracting the virus.
