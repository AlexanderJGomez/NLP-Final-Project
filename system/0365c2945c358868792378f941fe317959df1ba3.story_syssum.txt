Flournoy is the third big name to remove themselves from the consideration process, after the President announced Hagel's resignation on Monday.
a spokesperson for Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, who served in the Army's 82nd Airborne, said he "loves his job and wants to continue serving the people of Rhode Island in the United States Senate."
Other names being floated for the gig include White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and â€‹former Defense Secretary Colin Powell.
The official also said that the President's preference remains that he wants somebody who is steeped in the inner workings of the Pentagon.
