(CNN) -- It's not easy taking over from one of the greatest managers in football history, but David Moyes has been assured that one trophy in his debut season at Manchester United will be considered a success.
We've always had priorities obviously, and David is aware of that, but I hope he achieves it.
The 18-year-old, who underlined his status before the international break as one of the game's hottest young prospects with two goals in his first EPL start, was again to the fore as United dominated the first half.
However, United's defensive frailties were once again exposed as Adam Lallana diverted in a scrambled shot from Dejan Lovren in the 89th minute to deny Moyes successive wins for the first time since joining from Everton.
However, the Cameroon striker's cheeky dispossession of David Marshall when the visiting keeper bounced the ball -- which allowed Eden Hazard to equalize with the first of his two goals -- left Cardiff boss Malky Mackay fuming.
Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho refused to attend his press conference after being sent to the stands in the second half after protesting about Cardiff's alleged time-wasting.
The home side twice led, through Yohan Cabaye and Paul Dummett, despite having Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa sent off for a foul on Luis Suarez -- from which Steven Gerrard netted a penalty for Liverpool's first leveler.
