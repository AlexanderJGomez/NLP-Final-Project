John Kasich's signature on Senate Bill 5 had time to dry, public employee unions in Ohio and their allies began the process of gathering the signatures necessary to invoke a provision in the Ohio Constitution that allows legislation to be placed before the state's voters.
Within a few months, Senate Bill 5 opponents had managed to collect nearly 1 million valid signatures, more than three times what they needed to place the law on the November ballot.
Although shrinking in population relative to the rest of the country (after the 2010 census, the Buckeye state lost two seats in Congress), Ohio's electoral vote total is seen by the Republicans and the Democrats as being both up-for-grabs, and crucial to putting together an electoral majority.
Republicans in Ohio and nationwide saw in the results of the 2010 elections a mandate to trim back government at all levels.
Still, one can't ignore the fact that, in seeking to weaken public employee unions, the Republicans were also taking on the very groups who would be expected to bankroll Democrats in 2012.
The fear now among Republicans is not only that Senate Bill 5 will be repealed, but that organized labor in Ohio will emerge from this victory newly energized and better positioned to achieve its goals.
Polls showing Senate Bill 5 losing by nearly the same margin as the 1958 right-to-work measure ought to be sending chills down the spines of Buckeye Republicans.
Since no one has been elected president in more than 50 years without winning Ohio, it may well be that vote to repeal Senate Bill 5 in Ohio helps determine who will be taking the presidential oath in January of 2013.
