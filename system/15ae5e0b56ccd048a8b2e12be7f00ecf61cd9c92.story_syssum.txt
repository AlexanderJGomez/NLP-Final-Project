Asked about a pledge he signed previously against any kind of tax increase, Coburn said his more important pledge was to do what's best for the country.
While they have yet to reach final agreement, the senators participating in the so-called "Gang of Six" want their work to serve as an impetus for both sides to meet somewhere in the middle on the deficit reduction issue.
President Barack Obama and Democratic leaders oppose linking the debt ceiling measure to political issues, warning that a failure to raise the debt limit would amount to a U.S. default that would shake global markets, raise interest rates and stall or reverse economic recovery.
However, Coburn and Republican Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois, a Tea Party conservative elected last November, rejected the Democratic argument that the debt ceiling must be raised, saying the government has enough money to pay its debt obligations, at least for a few months.
So far, House Republicans have passed a 2012 budget proposal that would slash nonmilitary spending and overhaul Medicare and Medicaid while lowering tax rates with no revenue increase.
The Gang of Six negotiations focus on a deficit reduction plan compiled last year by a commission appointed by Obama that calls for increased revenue through tax reform, spending cuts in all areas and reforms to all the entitlement programs.
And at the end of the day, it has to be bipartisan or nothing is going to happen."
