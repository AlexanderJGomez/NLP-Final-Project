Los Angeles (CNN) -- San Diego Mayor Bob Filner, facing a growing tide of sexual harassment allegations, has completed his two-week intensive behavior therapy a week early and will begin outpatient treatment, his lawyer said.
In a personal letter to the mayor Friday, Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer, who addresses Filner as "Bob," wrote: "We've known each other for a long time.
So I am speaking to you now on a personal and professional level, and asking you to step down as mayor and get the help you need as a private citizen."
The mayor has vowed not to resign.
Filner served 10 terms, or 20 years, in Congress before being elected mayor of San Diego last year.
