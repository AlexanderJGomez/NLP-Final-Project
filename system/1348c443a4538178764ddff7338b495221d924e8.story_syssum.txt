Police in Georgia defended their decision Tuesday to handcuff and arrest a 6-year-old elementary student after the school called to report a juvenile had assaulted a principal and was damaging school property.
"I don't think she misbehaved to the point where she should have been handcuffed and taken downtown to the police department,"  Johnson's aunt, Candace Ruff, told CNN affiliate WMAZ.
Johnson's mother said she wondered if there was "any other kind of intervention" the school could have used to help her daughter.
The 6-year-old was initially charged as a juvenile with simple battery of a schoolteacher and criminal damage to property, but the police chief said at a news conference Tuesday the girl would not be charged because of her age.
Police notified the Department of Family and Children's Services about the incident, which is not the first of its kind in recent memory.
She was later turned over to her mother, who came to the school.
