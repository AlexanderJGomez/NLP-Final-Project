According to a poll by research consultancy ComRes, released on the first anniversary of the Games, 69% of participants said it was a good investment of public money.
Tombs said the figures also showed growth in all areas of the economy, which he noted was was a first in recent years.
But according to Matthew Jaffa, spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses, not enough is being done in the wake of the Olympics to promote "Brand London" as an exporter.
said the Games were "a triumph of public endeavour... it's a very good example of what a very dynamic and focused public sector can do."
