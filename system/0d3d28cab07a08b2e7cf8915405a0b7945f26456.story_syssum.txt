(CNN) -- Sri Lanka's cricket team returned home to Colombo early Wednesday, as police in Pakistan searched for at least 12 gunmen believed responsible for the attack that left seven people dead.
"We are very lucky that no one [sustained] any serious injuries and everyone is in good shape," one player told reporters upon arriving in the capital.
"The events can only be described as shocking, and we send our sympathy to the relatives of those who lost their lives," International Cricket Council President David Morgan said at a news conference in London Tuesday.
ICC Chief Executive Haroon Lorgat said none of the teams had been threatened before Tuesday's attack, which happened about 150 meters from the stadium in Lahore.
But Sri Lanka -- a country enduring its own civil war with separatist rebels -- agreed in December to visit for a series of matches, after the Indian cricket team called off its tour following the deadly terror attacks in Mumbai in November.
Pakistan was one of two countries that agreed to tour Sri Lanka during the 1996 World Cup tournament, while other countries refused to travel there because of security concerns.
"It's a very important event, but the safety and security of players, officials and supporters is very important and the board will be taking that into account."
John Stern, the editor of cricket magazine Wisden, said it was "not possible" to imagine international cricket taking place in Pakistan in the near future.
He said one possibility for the Pakistani team is to play its matches in the United Kingdom, which has a large Pakistani community.
