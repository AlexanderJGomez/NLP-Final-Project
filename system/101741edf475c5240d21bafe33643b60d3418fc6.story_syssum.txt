Rock Hill, South Carolina (CNN)A South Carolina judge on Wednesday threw out the convictions of the Friendship Nine, who were jailed in 1961 after a sit-in protest in Rock Hill, South Carolina, during the civil rights movement.
Condition: sent to the chain gang," she said for each of them, reading from the 1961 docket.
These courageous and determined South Carolinians have shown by their conduct and their faith that the relief that they seek should be granted.
There was only one reason that they were charged and convicted for trespassing, and that is because they were black.
These convictions, if they are allowed to stand, would be an offense to justice, and they must be vacated."
When Circuit Court Judge John C. Hayes III, the nephew of the judge who sentenced these largely unsung civil rights heroes almost 5Â½ decades ago, announced that the convictions and sentences were officially vacated, the 250 people in the courtroom broke into a 20-second standing ovation.
They took their seat at the lunch counter and were promptly arrested for trespassing by police who had caught wind of the men's plan and were already at the store waiting for them.
Rather than pay the $100 for their release, the men felt they could make a more profound statement by accepting the full punishment for trespassing: 30 days of hard labor.
