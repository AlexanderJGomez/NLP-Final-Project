It was aimed at bolstering the prospects for the peace talks in Geneva, Switzerland.
Ahmad al-Jarba, president of the Syrian National Coalition, a key opposition group, said Tuesday's talks had been "positive" and "encouraging," and it was the first time that all 11 core Friends of Syria governments had agreed on key points.
The Syrian opposition has set no preconditions for the talks other than that the aims agreed on at a first peace conference in Switzerland last year, known as Geneva I, should stand, Kerry told reporters.
The position of the United States has not changed on the need for al-Assad to go, Kerry added.
It is a road map that leads to a new future ... and it rids the country of violent extremist groups," he said.
The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said Tuesday that Syria's government had so far "fully cooperated in supporting the work of the advance team" of chemical weapons inspectors.
Kerry said it would be up to the United Nations and joint U.N.-Arab League envoy Lakhdar Brahimi to announce the date for the conference.
Brahimi said Sunday that he plans to meet with Russian and U.S. officials as well other representatives of the U.N. Security Council to finalize details.
