(CNN) -- We moved to suburban Akron in January 2003, just months before LeBron James graduated from St. Vincent-St. Mary High School and was drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers.
He talked to the children in the halls, often urging them to do well in school.
We'd see him shopping at Target or Best Buy, but we would give him his space.
Friday's announcement that James is returning to northeast Ohio capped off a spectacular week of Cleveland in the national spotlight.
Clevelanders have endured the departure of its athletic stars, the failure to win championships of its teams and the mockery that has come from political and sports analysts about why a political convention or the NBA's biggest star would go to Cleveland.
Many, if not most, understood the decision but hated the way it was delivered -- especially the people of Akron.
But even then, kids bought the Heat jerseys or James sneakers and followed @KingJames religiously on Twitter.
The mother in me wished he had gone to The 'Q to shake the hands of the security guards, custodial staff and the kitchen staff and to look in the eyes of Cavaliers leadership while thanking them for unwavering support.
I wanted him to know there were still boys in Copley, Bath and Akron who were looking up to him.
As political analysts second-guessed this week's RNC choice rather than the selection of Dallas and as sports analysts complained about having to spend more time working in Cleveland rather than sipping mojitos on South Beach, the people who live here have a deeply affectionate relationship with the city.
The kind of pride that comes when you believe you've worked hard and someone else has finally noticed.
I never mailed my letter to Mr. James, but I think he has long since gotten the message.
