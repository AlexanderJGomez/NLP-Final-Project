(CNN) -- Josep Guardiola has confirmed he is to step down as Barcelona coach at the end of this season, saying four years in charge of one of the world's biggest clubs is an eternity.
I'm sorry deeply for the confusion in the last few weeks.
The 41-year-old's announcement comes at the end of a disappointing week for the Spanish club, whose European title defense came to a halt just days after a defeat by arch-rivals Real Madrid all but ended its three-season domestic reign.
He won the Champions League again last season and also a third successive Spanish title, followed by success at the Club World Cup for a second time in December 2011.
"Because of the emotions I feel I preferred not to be present at Pep's press conference and to stay away from the press because I know they will look for the pain on the players' faces.
Despite speculation linking him to other jobs, he confirmed he would be taking a break from the game.
"I want to thank my players, who have been responsible for everything that has happened.
Guardiola said he recalled jumping up and down like a little boy when he was asked to take over as coach of Barcelona's 'B' team in 2007.
The one that will replace me (Villanova) is very able to take this on."
