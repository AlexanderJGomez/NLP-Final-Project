ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Chicken nuggets.
We found out about Teddy's allergies partially through trial and error and then through allergy testing when he was 18 months old, and we didn't want any more missteps.
When we are in the grocery store, we have to read every label to see if the food contains something harmful.
And just because a food item was OK last week doesn't mean the recipe hasn't changed.
Although the cheese looked like our regular vegan cheese without milk, it was an almost identical package that contained milk protein.
Once we get food into the house, we try to label it.
Who would think that something so simple could make another kid very sick?
Teddy's pre-K teachers are great -- they contact us for alternative suggestions when their lesson plans include food products.
Every time other parents send food in, we have to worry about whether Teddy will be safe.
The first reaction many people have to hearing of Teddy's allergies is a dumbfounded, "What does he eat?"
I know that I could just make rice pasta for everyone.
It's very easy for a contaminated utensil to be used in the kitchen without us knowing.
We're going to talk with the school nurse and cafeteria manager about strategies to keep Teddy safe.
In the lunchroom, Teddy can be watched so that if peanut butter touches him or milk is spilled on him, he will be decontaminated as quickly as possible.
We're hoping that the school nurse doesn't fall victim to budget cuts, because that is our emotional safety net right now.
It's all part of the constant vigilance, doing our best to keep him safe.
