Wild Oats and British entry Ran were both reported by the race committee a few hours earlier after breaking safety rules by failing to make radio contact, and a hearing will be held on Wednesday.
The 100-foot Wild Oats, skippered by Australian Mark Richards, sailed into the Tasmanian capital two days, seven hours, 37 minutes and 20 seconds after leaving Sydney Harbor, having led most of the way.
There is no way that as skipper I would have left Green Cape [on the south coast of New South Wales] without knowing we were 100% compliant with the rules."
"The damage we sustained was to the reef lines earlier and some tack lines on the headsail which, running without a headsail, put us an hour back.
Ran, skippered by Niklas Zennstrom and one of the pre-race favorites for line honors, had yet to finish.
