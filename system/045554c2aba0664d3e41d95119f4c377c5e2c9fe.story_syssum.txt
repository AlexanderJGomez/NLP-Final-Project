Then, this week, TMZ Sports released footage of surveillance video from inside the elevator that shows the altercation and the knock-out punch.
It shows Rice and Palmer inside the elevator, where he punches her, and she lunges at the football player.
To the disbelief of many, the NFL said it had not seen the surveillance footage of inside the elevator until TMZ Sports posted it on the internet.
The prosecutor's office and Atlantic City Police Department did not immediately respond to CNN inquiries about the evidence they had, or any requests from the NFL.
While the casino said that prosecutors were given the video of inside the elevator, prosecutors have not confirmed whether it was shown to the grand jury.
The elevator video has renewed outrage, but the court says the prosecutor cannot reconsider or ask the judge to revoke the deal with Rice unless he commits a new crime or doesn't follow along in the program.
The bad taste in many people's mouths comes from the way the incident has been described to the public by the parties involved.
When the grand jury decided to indict Rice on the more serious felony charge, Rice's attorney, Michael Diamondstein, had this to say as he entered a not-guilty plea: "I can't try the case in the media.
With the release of the latest video, many in the public certainly expressed a new opinion, but hardly in favor of Rice.
"No one knows the pain that the media & unwanted options from the public has caused my family," Janay Rice wrote in an online post.
According to Janay Rice, waking up after her husband was cut from his team and suspended from the NFL was a nightmare.
