It is still unclear what exactly happened when Sainz, from the Mexican network TV Azteca, entered the Jets locker room last Saturday after practice but Sainz told CNN's Rick Sanchez on Monday that from the moment she entered, she felt all eyes were on her.
CNN was not able to contact anyone else in the locker room at the time but Sainz said that a female colleague took her aside and expressed concern and embarrassment for the situation she was in.
Sainz confirmed in her interview on CNN's "Rick's List" that Jets team owner Woody Johnson called her personally to stress that all Jets members are expected to act professionally and to extend courtesy to members of media regardless of gender.
"Everyone knows that a woman or a man deserves the same treatment in the locker room."
