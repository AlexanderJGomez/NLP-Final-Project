From his high-rise office building in downtown Jakarta, Uno speaks of the sacrifices his parents made to send him to university in the United States.
He was forced to return home, but the timing couldn't have been worse with Asia in economic meltdown from the 1997 financial crisis.
Uno believes failure is just as important as success and while he admits there were plenty of hard knocks he was confident his gamble would pay off in the long term.
Around 40 million of the country's 242 million people still live below the poverty line and Uno describes this as a recipe for disaster.
Uno is extremely passionate about the future of Indonesia and while he will talk up the country as the next place to invest along side China and India, he's acutely aware and critical of its pitfalls.
"The money is there, we just need the government to sort out the land acquisition problem among other things which will require changes in the law and then we can start building the infrastructure Indonesia so desperately needs," he said.
He describes how impressed he was with the U.S. President who spoke to him in Bahasa and believes the leader of the free world knows just how important Indonesia has become.
Indonesia has the 18th largest economy but we're ranked 122 in the world for ease of doing business.
I think in the next four to five years Indonesia must be able to generate that expertise."
