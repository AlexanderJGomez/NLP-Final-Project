That was the selection made Wednesday by Kwasi Enin, the New York high school student accepted by the eight Ivy League schools -- Harvard, Yale, Brown, Columbia, University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth, Princeton and Cornell.
"We are grateful for all the inspiration," he said.
... We only pray that going forward he will stay focused and not be distracted."
Butler said Enin is not only a model academic student, but also plays three instruments for the chamber orchestra, sings in an a cappella group, throws shot put and discus for the high school's track and field team, participates in student government and has had a lead role in school plays since the ninth grade.
"He is an incredibly modest, humble and respectable person," Butler said.
"Standardized test scores and good grades will get a student in the door to have their application read," Rubin said.
"I really liked their sense of family, relationships between undergraduates and professors, and the residential college," he said earlier this month.

"Develop your outside interests -- not just academics."
