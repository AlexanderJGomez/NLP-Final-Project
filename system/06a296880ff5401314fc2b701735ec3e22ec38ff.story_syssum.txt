London (CNN) -- If keeping track of friends was the first wave of social media, the next may be all about hooking up with strangers.
The event brings together some of the biggest names in social media innovation and its agenda showcases a number of data services which, like Highlight, attempt to steer us away from the vagaries of chance.
Davison won't disclose how many people have signed up for Highlight to date, but our tests in London this week revealed a relatively thin pool of users.
To get there, he must first convince people of the value of sharing -- a task he acknowledges as tricky.
Davison, who is currently expanding Highlight's two-man operation with half a dozen new hires, said he believes users will be won over by the ability to validate peoples' identities via Facebook or other existing social media platforms, and by the limited space in which the data is broadcast.
Davison said he is not entirely sure how he will monetize his creation.
While some may doubt Highlight's ability to persuade a mass-market audience to share with strangers, Davison's goals aren't without precedent -- largely thanks to a trail blazed by similar app Badoo.
Though it has a reputation as a dating site -- some news reports have described it as like Facebook, but for sex -- the motivation behind Badoo's hook ups are numerous, according to Benjamin Ling, the company's newly appointed chief operating officer.
There is no charge to join, but users can pay to promote themselves across the network in the same way that retailers optimize their position in Google searches.
Badoo has already achieved the critical mass needed to make it a going concern and seems to have no problem persuading users to share personal details -- a fact that should be encouraging to Highlight and other, newer social startups.
"Teens growing up now are more comfortable with the online world, and so the cultural mores are beginning to change over time, and that makes us optimistic," he said.
