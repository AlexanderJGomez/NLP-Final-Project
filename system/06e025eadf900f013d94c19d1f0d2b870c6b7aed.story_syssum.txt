The engineer's lawyer and union representatives said the train's hypnotic motion may have caused him to nod off -- a case of what the lawyer termed "highway hypnosis."
A 2007 study of "alerter" technology by Massachusetts Institute of Technology said, "Engineers can become inattentive and keep hitting the alerter even when nodding off.
"During my years in the railroad industry, there have been numerous occasions when locomotive engineers have responded to alerter alarms while being in less than a fully conscious state."
The newer model locomotive in the rear, however, was equipped with an alerter system which sounds a tone every 25 seconds, requiring the engineer to respond with a tap within 15 seconds while the train is in steady motion.
Late Sunday, the MTA said it was taking additional safety measures: Signal crews installed new protections at the bend near the Spuyten Duyvil station in the Bronx -- where the fatal derailment occurred -- to warn engineers of the speed reduction and automatically apply emergency brakes if speed is not lowered to 30 mph.
At 7:11 a.m. that Sunday -- about 11 minutes before the derailment -- the engineer did not dim the train's headlights as required when it passed another train, the NTSB said Monday.
"We're into the hundreds of millions of dollars right now and we haven't even had the implementation of that system.
