The official government list of victims from this week's earthquake in central Italy reached 287 on Friday, as Italians held a mass state funeral to lay the victims to rest.
The funeral was being held outside a hangar in Coppito, a town adjacent to the earthquake's epicenter of L'Aquila.
Officials elected to hold the Mass in the open air to avoid the risk of injury from falling debris.
Bertone said the funeral was a "precious moment" to understand the meaning of life and death.
As well as sending Bertone to deliver his message, the pope sent holy oils to L'Aquila and a chalice with which to take Communion.
Recovering from such losses and rebuilding the city of L'Aquila will take several years, according to Miozzo.
Aftershocks have heightened anxiety in the area -- including a moderate 5.6 magnitude tremor that struck the area Tuesday.
Anna Rita Difilice lost her son, Fabio, 20, to the quake -- the deadliest to strike Italy in decades and the first major quake in the country in seven years.
"There is no way I'm leaving this town -- not ever."
