Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Early-morning commuters in much of the Deep South, braced for the possibility of a second round of snow and ice, had an easier-than-expected ride Monday as warmer temperatures kept winter weather at bay.
Forecasters initially had expected the rain to turn into snow after 1 a.m. Monday.
Delta Air Lines said Sunday that it was canceling 400 flights from early morning through noon Monday, the majority in the Carolinas, Tennessee and Georgia.
The area already has shoveled itself out of a season record snowfall of 55.9 inches, according to preliminary National Weather Service estimates.
Portions of Interstates 70 and 35 were closed for hours, according to the Kansas Department of Transportation.
During that period, 8.8 inches of snow fell on Harkers Island, North Carolina, according to weather service data.
As of Friday, according to the National Weather Service, 68.1 percent of the United States was covered with snow, compared with 51.2 percent in January.
