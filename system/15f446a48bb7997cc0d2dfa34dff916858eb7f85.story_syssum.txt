The futuristic-looking "Planet Solar," which is 100 percent powered by sunlight, is the brainchild of Swiss engineer Raphael Domjan, a former paramedic with a passion for innovative design and renewable energies.
The boat can travel at up to 14 knots (26k/m) and would be the first solar-powered boat to travel at such high speeds.
Planet Solar will be covered in 470 square meters of solar panels -- the equivalent of two tennis courts.
Batteries on Planet Solar will be able to store enough energy gathered from the sun to allow the boat to sail in poor conditions for three days, said Faigaux.
D'Abouville is the first man to have rowed across both the Atlantic and the Pacific and has long been involved with sustainable development.
Up to 500 people at any one time will be will be able to visit the village's three inflatable "spheres" to learn more about Planet Solar, ecology and economy.
