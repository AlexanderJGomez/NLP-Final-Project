Returning home as a penniless 29-year-old was "a harrowing experience" but provided Njoku, a chemist by training, with his Eureka moment -- he realized there's a growing appetite for Nollywood films after noticing how his mother and other relatives had difficulties getting their hands on their beloved movies from Nigeria's booming film industry.
Jason Njoku: When we started the company, iROKO Partners, we were trying to solve the massive, I would say, dislocation in the popularity of Nollywood and the value it's created.
We've spent a lot of money -- in the industry, licenses, organizing our team, we've got a staff of 100 people -- so our view is that some additional value needs to ... be given to this new subscription service we're rolling out, (called) iROKOtv+.
But at the same time, the pan-African nature of it -- from the Kenyans to the Ghanaians to Gambians to people in the DRC -- there's a massive base of people who really love this content.
Most definitely there are 25 million people in Nigeria who love this content.
So we wouldn't want to compare ourselves to Netflix but we have an interest and opportunity to at least get somewhere along that line.
Internet adoption has definitely exploded in Nigeria and we feel it's better -- again, we're trying to serve very data-intensive, bandwidth hogging files, so we're always going to be slower on the uptake but it is improving.
Whereas my friends went into banking, consulting, finance, I just wanted to be an entrepreneur, to work in projects which really interested me.
That was itself a harrowing experience but the interesting thing was that for the first time in eight years since I'd moved out I was actually able to see the viewing patterns of my mom change...She'd gone from watching western films to watching African films.
Before, they were losing out to the pirates, now they are gaining financially from iROKOtv.
