"Mario Balotelli has been charged by The FA in relation to a recent posting on social media," read the statement.
Liverpool said they plan to speak to Balotelli, who has missed the club's last three games due to a groin injury he picked up on international duty in November.
Balotelli has yet to score a Premier League goal since joining Liverpool from AC Milan in the summer transfer window, though he did find the net against Ludogorets in the Champions League as well as against Swansea in the English League Cup.
The minimum ban for race-related rule breaches is five games under the FA's social media guidelines.
