Rose Mayr and Elizabeth Nass, both 19, were apparently sitting on a bridge ledge in Ellicott City, Maryland, just after midnight with their backs to the train when it derailed, according to a written statement from Howard County police.
The name Ellicott City is painted on the railroad bridge.
Mayr was a nursing student at the University of Delaware who was about to start her junior year.
"She was goofy at times but could be there for you when you needed it."
Marmie Edwards, spokeswoman for Operation Lifesaver, a nonprofit organization that promotes railroad safety measures, said the number of fatalities in 2012 involving people on tracks was up significantly.
According to the Federal Railroad Administration, through the first five months of the year, 178 people have been killed in accidents on or near tracks (not including at a railroad crossing).
