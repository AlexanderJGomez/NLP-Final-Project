"I have done quite a few roll-outs and launches of new cars, but even after all these years I must say it still feels special," Schumacher, who won two championships with Benetton in 1994 and 1995 and five with Ferrari between 2000 and 2004, told the sport's official website.
Schumacher, who has started 287 grands prix since making his debut in 1991, has failed to finish on the podium since returning to the grid and only registered one top-four finish last year, at June's rain-affected Canadian Grand Prix.
The former Williams pilot was looking forward to learning more about the new car ahead of the season getting under way in Australia next month.
From the beginning of our running, we have been able to focus on understanding the car and making good progress with our test program.
