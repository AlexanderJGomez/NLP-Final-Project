"This house is not livable right now," Nelson Ortega, the city's chief building code inspector, told CNN as he stood in front of a boarded-up single-family home on a residential street in Nashua.
"About a third of all of the foreclosed properties nationwide have been so damaged, either by the previous owners or by criminal gangs coming in after the foreclosure, that they no longer qualify for standard mortgage financing," Thomas Popik told CNN.
Popik says responses from thousands of real estate agents nationwide to the questionnaires he sends out quarterly indicate that badly damaged foreclosed homes -- so-called "distressed" properties in real estate jargon -- are a much bigger element of the national housing picture than officials in Washington have acknowledged.
In some cities hit harder by the national economic downturn, a quick glance at foreclosed homes paints an even harsher picture.
Trash was everywhere; plaster walls had been ripped open to expose wiring; and in one case a toilet was dumped on an empty living room floor.
Some of the information, a spokesman said, was "anecdotal," but there was no data one way or the other yet collected.
But, the spokesman added, the worse the economy is in a particular region, the more damaged and vandalized foreclosed homes are likely to be.
