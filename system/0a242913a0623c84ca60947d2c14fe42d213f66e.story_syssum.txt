Under fire in years past for including trans fats, high fructose corn syrup and palm oil in its cookies, the Girl Scouts' current cookie selling season is under fire because of policies that have nothing to do with the actual composition of the cookies.
"I ask all fellow Girl Scouts who want a true, all-girl experience not to sell any Girl Scouts cookies until GSUSA (Girl Scouts of the USA) addresses our concerns," says the girl, identified as a teen named Taylor, a troop member from California, in some news reports.
The video was prompted by the case of Bobby Montoya, whose mother told a CNN affiliate in October that a troop leader initially told her that Bobby couldn't join the troop because Bobby "has boy parts," even though her child identifies as a girl.
When contacted via its listed Gmail account to comment, someone replied that the group's "legal counsel has advised us not to comment or do interviews until further notice."
Owen reports hearing from people who decided to break their New Year's resolutions to go on a diet with a Girl Scout cookies purchase.
