Washington (CNN) -- When you consider the array of public men who have been forced, in one way or another, to come clean on their bad behavior, the list is not insubstantial: a president (Bill Clinton), presidential candidates (John Edwards, Gary Hart), governors (Mark Sanford, Eliot Spitzer), senators (John Ensign, David Vitter).
But some discovered the public can be forgiving, especially if it believes you have something important to offer to the nation.
But here's the rub: Cain also tells us that the National Restaurant Association investigated the charges against him and found them to be "baseless."
Give the association's board permission to release the results of their internal investigation, if there was a formal inquiry.
Feminist groups, by and large, remained largely on the sidelines or supportive of Clinton -- because he was, um, not a sexual harasser.
"For we who led the charge against Bill Clinton on a number of related issues to continue to blame the media or other campaigns or say it simply doesn't matter makes us the hypocrites as well," he wrote on CNN.com.
When declarations of innocence do not seem to be enough, there's the change-the-subject tack: How about fingering a leaker, say from Rick Perry's staff?
And the fact that Hillary was right about those who were "out to get" Clinton does not mean he was in the clear.
The bar may be set low for the politicians, but the public somehow manages to rise above it.
