(CNN) -- The husband of an Indian dentist whose death sparked anger over Ireland's abortion laws told an inquest on Monday that her requests for a termination for her miscarrying fetus had been denied.
He has previously said that his wife was advised her unborn baby would likely die, and that she was in extreme pain.
The couple, who married in India, had moved to Ireland four years before Savita's death and were excited to be starting a family, Praveen Halappanavar told CNN last year.
A number of inquiries were set up by Irish authorities after Halappanavar died, including one by the Health Service Executive.
Minister of Health James Reilly announced late last year that the proposed changes would clarify that abortions are permissible when the life -- but not just the health -- of the mother is at risk.
