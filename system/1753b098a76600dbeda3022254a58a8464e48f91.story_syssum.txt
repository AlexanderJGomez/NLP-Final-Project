A shark, described as being 14 to 20 feet in length, bit off the left leg of Lucas McKaine Ransom of Romoland, California, while he was Boogie Boarding with a 20-year-old male friend, said a spokesman with the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department.
His friend and other witnesses pulled him from the water, authorities said.
"Our first responders were on scene to assist in rescue efforts," Col. Richard Boltz, 30th Space Wing commander, said in a statement.
