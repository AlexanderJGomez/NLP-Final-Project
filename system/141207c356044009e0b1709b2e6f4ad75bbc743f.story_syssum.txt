"Another soldier in my life has fallen," Robinson said in a statement.
Claudette Robinson, another member of the Miracles, said that while Rogers was her cousin, he was more "like a brother to me."
Robinson, Rogers and the rest of the Miracles were a cornerstone act for writer-producer Berry Gordy's infant Motown Records, putting songs such as "Shop Around," "Tracks of My Tears" and "The Tears of a Clown" on the R&B and pop charts throughout the 1960s.
The Miracles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012.
