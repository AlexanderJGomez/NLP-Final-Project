Television viewership numbers continue to set new highs with each U.S. game The proverbial office water cooler has been abuzz with chatter about the U.S. team's dramatic 2-1 win over Ghana and its heartbreaking, last second 2-2 tie with Portugal.
Thousands filled the streets for viewing parties in Chicago, Pittsburgh, Kansas City, Seattle and Washington -- in the middle of the workday.
"One can only hope that, in addition to learning English, these new Americans will drop their soccer fetish with time."
A changing America has become younger and more diverse, and those two demographics simply love soccer more than their parents.

Not too many years ago, the standard joke was that soccer was the game of the future -- and always would be.
Well, it seems the future is finally here and it's here to stay.
