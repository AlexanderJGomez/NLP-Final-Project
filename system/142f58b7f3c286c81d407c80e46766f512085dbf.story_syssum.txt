Serena has overcome life-threatening blood clots on both lungs, while older sibling Venus is this week making her long-awaited WTA Tour comeback as she battles a debilitating illness that has sidelined her since last year's U.S. Open.
"When you don't feel well and things are taken away from you, it's hard to stay positive," the former world No.
"It's easy to say, 'I've done enough' -- or it would be easy to go on a permanent vacation.
Williams has played just one Fed Cup doubles rubber for the U.S. team and an exhibition match against Serena since withdrawing in New York on August 31, and she will make her return as a wildcard at the Miami Masters this week -- an event she has won on three occasions.
"I don't think the road will be perfect, but I think I can get it as close to perfect as possible," she said.
For me, it's worth doing everything I can to get back to what I love doing."
Another motivator for Williams is the prospect of challenging for a fourth Olympic gold medal in London, where the tennis tournament will be held at Wimbledon.
