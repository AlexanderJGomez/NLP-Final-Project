Rossmiller says the military's attitude about the report -- she says political correctness trumped the study -- caused it to fail in its intended purpose of helping the military detect signs that one of its own might pose a threat.
She said it was meant to detect signs of extremism like those reportedly exhibited by Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, an Army psychiatrist who authorities say killed 13 at Fort Hood.
Ryan G. Anderson, a Muslim convert who was convicted in 2004 of trying to pass information to al Qaeda over the Internet.
"The intent behind the whole report was to provide a useful tool for intelligence officials to spot and identify certain signs of radical behavior," she said.
A key congressional committee opened an investigation into the shootings Thursday, pledging to find out if authorities failed to "connect the dots" and could have prevented the attack.
Among other issues, the FBI has said it was aware of communication between Hasan an Anwar al-Awlaki, a Yemeni-American cleric who has promoted jihad against the United States and other Western countries.
"People are saying that, 'Wow, this is brand new,' but in my travels, in talking with counterterrorism experts around the world, especially in Europe, this whole process of radicalization has gone through a much more in-depth study, a much more professional rigor than I think what we've seen in the United States," Rep. Pete Hoekstra of Michigan, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN's Anderson Cooper.
None of the items that have been reported since the shootings -- including the reported Walter Reed memo and the PowerPoint presentation arguing that Muslims in the Army should be allowed conscientious objector status -- were part of the file, the official said, but it was noted that Hasan had done research about Muslims in the military.
"I think what you need to do here is, you need to understand the phenomenon," Hoekstra said.
