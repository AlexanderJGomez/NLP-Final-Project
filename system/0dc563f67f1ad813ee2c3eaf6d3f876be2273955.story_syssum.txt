2014 was a year of profound fear for communities living with -- and dying of -- the disease; of health workers making the ultimate sacrifice, dying as they tried to save; of apocalyptic forecasts as to the disease's possible spread.
Sierra Leone has 65 confirmed cases, most in the west of the country around the capital and Port Loco where the disease spreads through overcrowded slums.

Admitting to organizational shortcomings Margaret Chan, the WHO's Director General, has asked the world's wealthier nations to step up to the plate and support poor countries' fragile health care systems.
They have always had some of the lowest ratio of healthcare workers to patients in the world.
Then Ebola destroyed what little healthcare they had, taking the lives of 488 health workers and leaving people too terrified to go through the doors of clinics they saw as harbourers of the disease.
"We know that during the height of the epidemic immunization rates collapsed by some 70%," says Sheldon Yett, UNICEF's country representative in Liberia.
Susan Michaels-Strasser, project director of the Global Nurse Capacity Building Programme at the Mailman School of Public Health at Colombia University, has just spent three weeks assessing the impact of these CCCs in Sierra Leone.
The original idea behind the CCCs was to train local volunteers in infection control procedures and have them man the units.
And for all the fear, the heartache and the stigma around the disease, there's a clear sense of pride amongst those who are leading the charge against Ebola at a community level.
"Even elders will listen to me more than they would to you because I have been a victim of Ebola," he says, beaming with pride.
Now the question is how to use these resources to transition from an emergency response situation to more sustainable healthcare provision in the future.
