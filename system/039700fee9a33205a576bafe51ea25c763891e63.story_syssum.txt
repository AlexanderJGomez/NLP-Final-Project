When their son told his parents he was gay, the Schaefers recognized his pain and chose to embrace him.
The minister knew that performing the ceremony was going to stoke the ire of his superiors and that it was against church doctrine.
On Thursday, the minister at Zion United Methodist Church of Iona in the small town of Lebanon was found guilty in a church trial for officiating his son's same-sex wedding, church officials said.
Schaefer refused, telling the Board of Ordained Ministry that he could not uphold the church's Book of Discipline in its entirety because it is discriminatory.
"I didn't realize it right away, but my wife told me, when we were in the car, she said, 'Look at your hand,' and I looked at it.
I never thought this would ever come back after that long of a time, so I went on ministering.
His son was recently interviewed, saying that he feels guilt for what has happened to his father, Schaefer said.
We just have to stop the discrimination in the church."
But eventually, he became a "silent supporter" of his son, and once someone complained about the performance of his son's wedding, he decided to be vocal and open about his feelings.
He said he has already filed an appeal and hopes to become reinstated to the Methodist clergy.
