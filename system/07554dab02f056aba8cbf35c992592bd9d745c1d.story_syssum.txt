(CNN) -- Sony is reducing the price of the PlayStation 3 game console, hoping to help the 5-year-old system reach a larger audience, the company said on Tuesday.
Sony last cut prices on the PlayStation 3 in 2009, when it released a slimmer model.
Last month, Nintendo cut the price of the 3DS, its handheld game console that displays 3-D graphics without needing special glasses.
Sales of the 3DS tumbled quickly after a promising launch, and analysts have attributed the proliferation of inexpensive, quick-hit games for Facebook and smartphones as a hindrance to growth in the market for hand-held game systems.
The cyberattack, which resulted in stolen personal and financial information, did not seem to harm sales of the console, according to reports.
