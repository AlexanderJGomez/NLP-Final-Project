(CNN) -- Two of Turkey's main political parties are pushing for a constitutional amendment to lift bans on headscarves at public universities, a move that has caused concern among Turkey's secular population.
"This is a direct threat to the republic and its foundations," said Deniz Baykal, leader of Turkey's main secular party, CHP.
He said that allowing headscarves would be a rejection of Turkey's secular system of government.
He said a majority of female high school students at one school were wearing headscarves during last weekend's entry exams -- a rarity in Turkish schools.
