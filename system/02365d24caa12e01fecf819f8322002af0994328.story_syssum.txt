Sawyer's father, Matthew Jones, said he was sure the tigers couldn't escape from their zoo exhibit.
Just a day after a tiger mauled one person to death and injured two others at the zoo, the elder Jones, of Menlo Park, California, was in shock.
"We couldn't believe that we were there just a few hours earlier," Matthew Jones said.
"When we were there, we were discussing how it wasn't much of a stretch that they could jump over that gap," she said.
"We were joking at the time, and it's horrible it happened to [Sousa]."
He has been going to the zoo for years and said he always thought it was theoretically possible for the tigers to escape their exhibit.
Reflecting on the mauling, Williams said she will continue to go see the animals and added that she's observed that renovations go on all the time.
"I guess it's just a risk you take, but it's very sad."
