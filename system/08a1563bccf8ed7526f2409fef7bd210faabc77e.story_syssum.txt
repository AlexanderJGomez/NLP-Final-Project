NASA and SpaceX said the problem was with the Falcon 9 rocket's second stage, rather than the section it plans to try to land.
The second stage of the rocket delivers the payload -- in this case, supplies for the International Space Station -- to the desired orbit.
Those tests showed that the rocket is capable of reducing its speed from hypersonic to nearly zero, and deploy landing legs.
When the launch happens, the company will try the same soft landing for the Falcon 9's first stage, but this time on a custom-built floating platform it calls the autonomous spaceport drone ship.
Keith Smith, of Britain's Royal Astronomical Society, told CNN the reason for using the platform -- despite the complications of landing on a moving target -- was that it should prevent any properties on Earth being damaged if the landing goes wrong.
The timing of the next launch attempt will depend on how serious the problem is, he said.
