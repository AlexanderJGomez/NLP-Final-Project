The 220,000-square-foot addition will be used to find cures for childhood cancers, and will double the Huntsman Cancer Institute's research space, said the 76-year-old businessman and philanthropist, father of former Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman Jr.
His family "has put about $400 million into the cancer center, and we've raised about a billion dollars for cancer research (overall)," he says.
Huntsman's riches grew out of a small plastics company he founded in the early 1970s.
"It was just something that in my heart I've always believed, that if you are generous and help others, you'll be blessed in your own life.
Huntsman spent more than a decade on the Forbes billionaire list, but he's fallen off it due to his many contributions -- something he's fine with.
While progress has been made in treating and curing children with cancer, it's still the leading cause of death by disease among U.S. children ages 1 to 14.
