Los Angeles (CNN)Conrad Hilton, the younger brother of celebrity heiress Paris Hilton, has reached a plea deal: He would admit guilt to misdemeanor assault against flight attendants in exchange for a federal felony charge being dropped, court papers says.
Hilton signed court papers last week that state he "repeatedly entered the bathroom to smoke marijuana and tobacco" during Flight 269 from London to Los Angeles, court papers said.
The court documents alleged Hilton punched the bulkhead next to an attendant's head, missing his face by about 4 inches, and told the crew, "I could get you all fired in five minutes.
Conrad Hilton left his seat five minutes after takeoff, even though the "fasten seat belt" sign was still on, authorities said.
A French family was seated behind Hilton, and the father got out of his seat and leaned "over his kids in a protective gesture" during one of Hilton's rants, a flight attendant told authorities, according to court papers.
The pilot later confronted Hilton, and Hilton surrendered a used pack of cigarettes and a lighter, authorities said.
"As Hilton was being restrained, he told the flight attendants he was a model and that they were 'going to ruin my career,' " according to an affidavit by FBI agent David Gates filed in court in early February.
Later, in an interview with the FBI the same day, Hilton said he started his travels in Mykonos, Greece, had a connection in Athens, and then traveled to London, authorities said.
