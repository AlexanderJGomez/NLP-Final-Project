In a record-setting month, it won't be the worst storm that Boston has ever seen, but it will just compound the exasperation caused by three -- now four -- weather systems that have dumped piles of snow on the city.
Birth rates have been known to jump nine months after natural and man-made disasters, according to Dr. Robi Ludwig, a psychotherapist.
-- Light snow, relatively speaking: Compared with other storms, this won't be as big a snow event for Boston.
The storm surge in northeastern parts of the state and in Maine could be 2 to 2Â½ feet.
-- No mass transit Sunday: MBTA, better known to many as the T, won't run Sunday, when the worst of the weather will be hitting.
-- Whiteout conditions: There is no ban on driving but it seems now like it would be a pretty bad idea.
-- Flight trouble: Dozens of flights that had been scheduled to land at Boston's Logan International Airport on Saturday have been called off already.
-- Frozen out: The snow emergency has led to the cancellation of Sunday's two performances of "Disney on Ice presents Frozen" at TD Garden.
You could travel from there to Maine's border with Canada and face gusts of 40 mph or stronger the entire way.
-- Record month: With 42.3 inches of snow recorded this month, Boston has already had the snowiest February on record and with the first inch of Saturday's snow, this month will become the snowiest of any month in Boston history, at least since records have been kept since 1872.
