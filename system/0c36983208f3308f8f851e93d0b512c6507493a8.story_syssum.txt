Self-immolation has become a desperate form of protest in recent years for ethnic Tibetans unhappy with Chinese rule, and it shows no sign of abating.
Independently verifying the reported self-immolations inside China is often difficult because of restrictions on reporting from the restive areas and the reluctance of local officials to comment on the accounts provided by foreign groups such as Free Tibet.
Scores of others have since followed suit, with the frequency of the self-immolations increasing significantly last year, according to Free Tibet.
Beijing has taken a tough line on Tibetan self-immolators and their associates inside China, accusing the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, of fomenting unrest.
Beijing rejects accusations of oppression, saying that under its rule, living standards have greatly improved for the Tibetan people.
