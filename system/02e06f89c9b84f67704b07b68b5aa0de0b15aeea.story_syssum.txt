Tsipras has vowed to end austerity measures and renegotiate the terms of Greece's European Union bailout.
Declaring victory for Syriza on Sunday after polls showed it winning at least 149 seats in the 300-seat parliament, Tsipras, 40, appeared to brace for a bigger battle.
"Greece leaves behind the austerity that ruined it, leaves behind the fear, leaves behind five years of humiliation, and Greece moves forward with optimism and hope and dignity," he told the crowd.
There is no room for unilateral action in Europe, that doesn't exclude a discussion, for example, on the rescheduling of this debt.
Unemployment has soared to 28%, and many people who still have jobs have seen drastic decreases in wages, pensions frozen and the retirement age pushed back.
"The tide is changing in Europe, the macro is improving in Greece, the European Central Bank is launching an unprecedented easing, and that will have a significant bearing on the fortunes of Greece going forward," Anthimos Thomopoulos said.
But it's unclear how Syriza's plans to renegotiate the bailout would play out.
