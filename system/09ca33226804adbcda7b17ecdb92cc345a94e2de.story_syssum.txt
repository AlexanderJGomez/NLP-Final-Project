He said he had written to them to say it was more important to let Scottish legal proceedings run their course, since a review commission had found possible miscarriages of justice in the case.
The Scottish government released al-Megrahi from prison just over a year ago on the grounds that he had cancer and was not likely to live more than three more months.
Swire thinks al-Megrahi feels guilty about having withdrawn his appeal, since it leaves him with no way to clear his name or for those -- like Swire -- who think he is innocent to have the case reviewed.
"As we have expressed repeatedly to Scottish authorities, we maintain that al-Megrahi should serve out the entirety of his sentence in prison in Scotland," Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a written statement.
Robert Menendez and Frank Lautenberg noted that al-Megrahi was only given three months to live when he was released but is still alive.
The case has outraged many on both sides of the Atlantic and led U.S. senators to demand answers from Scotland about the details of his release.
A special Scottish court in the Netherlands convicted al-Megrahi in 2001.
