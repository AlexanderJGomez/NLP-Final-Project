The result, sealed with more than a day to spare, meant Pakistan became the first team since 1907 to win a Test after scoring less than 100 in their first innings.
However, the batsmen continued their poor tour and collapsed to 252 all out as in-form spinner Saeed Ajmal and fast bowler Umar Gul took four wickets each.
I've got great faith in our players but this is an eye-opener.
Jonathan Trott followed as England slipped to 85-2 and Kevin Pietersen continued his poor form by also making 18 before being removed by Ajmal.
Ajmal, who was the series' top wicket-taker with 24, denied Cook a half century before Gul tore into England's middle order.
Panesar was one of England's few positives for the tour, taking 14 wickets in two Tests with his left-arm spin while Broad and Swann claimed 13 each.
