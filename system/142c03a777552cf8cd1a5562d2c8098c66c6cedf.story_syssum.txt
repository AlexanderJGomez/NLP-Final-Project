"He was a gentle, quiet man," Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Friday, referring to Wilson.
A resident of the St. Louis area, Wilson, 28, has been staying at a secure location since the shooting.
One of Wilson's friends, Jake Shepard, said he couldn't imagine the officer killing somebody.
Shepard said Wilson "has a huge heart" and cares about people.
The disclosure of the officer's identity was overshadowed by new details from the police implicating Brown as a suspect in a convenience-store robbery that was reported shortly before the shooting.
The Ferguson police chief, before speaking to reporters, told CNN's Don Lemon that the officer was devastated by what had happened.
The documents said Wilson, who was treated for injuries after the shooting, was in the area of the shooting after leaving a report of a sick person when he spotted Brown.
The suspect roughly handled a clerk trying to stop him before walking out of the store with a box of Swisher Sweets cigars, according to the documents.
Earlier this week, the shooting sparked protests and isolated looting incidents, and Ferguson police responded with rubber bullets and tear gas.
The mayor also is white, and so are five of the six city council members.
