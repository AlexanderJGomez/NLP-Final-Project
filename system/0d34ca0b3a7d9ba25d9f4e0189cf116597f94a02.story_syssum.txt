A woman in Tel Aviv, Israel, gave her elderly mother a new mattress as a surprise gift, throwing out the old tattered bed her mother had slept on for decades.
Annat, who did not want to reveal the rest of her name, told Israel Army Radio that she woke up early Sunday to get a good deal on a new mattress as a surprise for her mother.
Annat alerted the two major dump sites in the Israeli city in an effort to locate the bed, but so far she has had no luck.
"'The heart is crying but you know we could have been in a car accident or had a terminal disease,'" Annat said her mother told her.
