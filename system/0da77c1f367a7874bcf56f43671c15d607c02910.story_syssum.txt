New York (CNN) -- A self-described "ex-madam" who claims she supplied fellow city comptroller candidate Eliot Spitzer with escorts several years ago is facing charges of illegally distributing prescription drugs, authorities said.
"Prescription drug abuse is the fastest-growing drug problem in this country, resulting in more overdose deaths than heroin and cocaine combined, and this office has a zero tolerance policy towards anyone who helps to spread this plague at any level," Preet Bharara, Manhattan U.S. Attorney, said in a statement.
Based on information from the FBI's witness, the FBI set up a sting operation from January through March of this year, in which Davis sold pills on three separate occasions to the witness, who she believed to be a drug dealer, the complaint states.
A former hedge fund senior vice president, Davis is running as a Libertarian with a plan to legalize marijuana in New York City.
