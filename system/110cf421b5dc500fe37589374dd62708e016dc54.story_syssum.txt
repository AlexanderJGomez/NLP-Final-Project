(CNN) -- Police in British Columbia say a man wanted for allegedly recording himself reaching speeds of at least 186 mph on his motorcycle and posting the video on YouTube has been arrested.
The Saanich Police Department on Vancouver Island said the incident took place on April 6 on a busy stretch of the Trans-Canada Highway.
Police in Kelowna aren't sure why Scott chose their town as the place to surrender, but said they are working with Saanich police investigators on the case.
Since Scott surrendered in the same province where he was wanted, the extradition process is less complex, according to Royal Canadian Mounted Police Constable Kris Clark.
