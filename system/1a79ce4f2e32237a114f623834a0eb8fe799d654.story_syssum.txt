The tour boat had a clean record, said the president of Ride the Ducks, who traveled to Philadelphia from the company's headquarters in Norcross, Georgia.
"What we hope to learn [is how] to prevent this from ever happening again," Herschend said.
"The private citizens helped [rescuers] get people out of the water."
Lt. Frank Vanore of the Philadelphia Police Department told reporters Wednesday that the boat had "mechanical trouble" and the engine shut down after a fire on board.
"We want to find out what happened and issue safety regulations so that this does not happen again," said Sumwalt, who is vice chairman of the NTSB.
He said he could not speculate on whether there was a fire onboard or how the boat's captain communicated during the incident.
"It is my expectation for the captain that he followed our emergency procedures to the letter," he said.
Searchers located the boat in about 50 feet of murky water, but it was too dangerous to send divers down, said William Blackburn, deputy commissioner of the Philadelphia police.
The company's website posted this message Thursday: "Our thoughts and prayers are with our Philadelphia tour guests, crew members and their families.
In the interim, we have voluntarily suspended our Ride The Ducks operations nationwide.
