He is fortunate not just because he has a natural talent for soccer and the dedication to rise through the ranks in his native Gambia and eventually go to the United States to play for the Seattle Sounders.
You are throwing up all the time.
On Saturday, before their game against the San Jose Earthquakes, Nyassi and his teammates will mark World Malaria Day by giving a check for $20,000 they raised for Nothing But Nets, a U.N. Foundation-sponsored campaign to supply anti-malarial bed nets to some of the poorest parts of the world.
"The challenge is enormous because of the size," says Dr. Regina Rabinovich, director of Infectious Diseases Development at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which so far has dedicated over $1 billion to fighting and preventing malaria.
While malaria can be treated, getting that treatment to people suffering from the disease who are often in remote places and with little access to health care is not always easy.
"The really interesting thing about malaria is that they haven't depended on a magic silver bullet," she explains.
"The immune system learns [and] is trained to recognize it -- and when the real parasite comes in, the one that can infect you, your immune system is very quickly able to eliminate it."
If it is successful, the vaccine that Kappe is formulating will aim to prevent malaria every time it is administered -- a crucial element to fighting a disease that is passed from person to person by mosquito bites.
Success playing soccer means Sanna Nyassi no longer needs to be wary of malaria, but that hasn't made him forget those that do.
I have to look back at the other ones."
