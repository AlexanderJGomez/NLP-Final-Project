I caught up with him at his HQ in the Mori Building in downtown Tokyo, one of the most desirable business addresses in the city.
Facebook became such a big company and I think they are doing well in how they are changing society.
However, my motivation is that I want to have an impact on society with my business.

Not just our company but the whole of Japan should consider developing an industry like that.
