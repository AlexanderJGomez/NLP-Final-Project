The horror that followed Tuesday at the Army Public School and Degree College in Peshawar, Pakistan, has shocked the world: 145 people dead, most of them children.
"My thigh was burning like metal -- I fell," the seventh-grader told CNN at Peshawar's Lady Reading Hospital where he was being treated for his injuries.
"The bodies were falling in front of us," he said, and then one of the militants climbed on a desk and started shooting at individual students.
"Then they went outside and started firing inside from the windows."
"I saw a pair of big black boots coming towards me, this guy was probably hunting for students hiding beneath the benches," he told the French news agency.
I saw death so close and I will never forget the black boots approaching me -- I felt as though it was death that was approaching me."
"She was sitting on the chair with blood dripping from her body as she burned."
"I told the children to get off their school benches and go under the benches.
The exams and the lecture in the auditorium meant students were grouped in different parts of the school, he said.
He is in a casket now," cried Tahir Ali as he came to the hospital to collect the body of his 14-year-old son, Abdullah.
Irshadah Bibi, 40, whose 12-year-old son was among the dead, beat her face in grief, AFP reported.
She was throwing herself against an ambulance at the Lady Reading Hospital, AFP said, one of many inconsolable parents.
