Standing amid the rubble, Yestin, 23, recalls that horrific day: She had just returned home from her job as a secretary at Léogâne's Cool FM radio station and was preparing to take a bath when the earth started rumbling.
After she buried him, after she found a small plot of land outside a local school to set up temporary shelter, Yestin thought about what she might do to mend her broken soul, her broken nation.
Since the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship in the 1980s, Haiti has created many civil society organizations and groups, but none has been particularly strong in the midst of political and economic turmoil, said Sophie Perez, the country director for the humanitarian agency CARE, which has worked in Haiti since 1954.
But as determined as Yestin is to help, this particular community chore is hardly easy for her Scout troop.
Yestin and her friends broke out in a song about being together; it was the only way to get through life's tribulations.
She tore open the plastic-on-foam mattresses and blankets to hand out to the needy.
"I will do my very best to help others because that is what I have been trained to do," she said about her five years in the Scouts.
But it was her father who made a living as a mason.
So on this blazing afternoon, amid the despair of the needy, she simply took comfort.
