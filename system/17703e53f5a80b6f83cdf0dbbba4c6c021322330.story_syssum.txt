Santa Cruz, California (CNN) -- The arrest of Alix Catherine Tichelman in the death of a Google executive has shed a new light on the so-called sugar daddy websites where women are paid, sometimes thousands of dollars a month, by older suitors for their company.
"The women who are on the site, or as we call them 'sugar babies,' are looking for men who can provide financial assistance for them," said Angela Jacob Bermudo with Seeking Arrangement.
It's been a profitable arrangement for college grad Bella, who has managed to cut her college debt in half over the last two years, knocking $30,000 off the total.
Critics say the sugar daddy sites are nothing but fronts for prostitution, one of the crimes Tichelman has been charged with.
"I don't think that makes it legal in California or any other state where prostitution is illegal," said Mel Robbins, a CNN contributor.
"Certainly as with any healthy relationship, if both parties do become a little bit more connected and do decide they want to become more intimate, then that's up to the two consenting adults."
Security footage from Hayes' yacht shows her administer the heroin injection and what happened afterward, as he was dying, police say.
"Rather than provide first aid or call 911, Ms. Tichelman proceeds to gather her belongings including the heroin and needles," the police statement reads, adding that Tichelman stepped over Hayes' body several times.
Now authorities are taking a new look at that death "to make sure there's nothing (else) to it," he said.
