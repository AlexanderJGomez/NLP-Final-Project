"It's my job to navigate him safely into the port, maneuver his vessel and then safely put it alongside the quayside."
This welcoming procedure guides ships into the province's newest port, which is also a multi-billion dollar industrial park that's growing faster than anyone expected.
One reason not everyone was excited with the construction of Ngqura was that there were already seven other ports in operation in the country, whereas one of the stated aims of the authorities is to "minimize duplications" between shipping facilities.
But these issues haven't stopped Ngqura from becoming the fastest growing terminal in the world in February 2013, according to Drewry Maritime Research.
"It is a strategic driver of development, firstly by bringing about a level of diversification in the regional economy to reduce it's over dependence on the automotive sector, as well as agri-processing.
Another local business that is seeing growth is Miya's Electrical, and it's Coega that makes up 40% of their annual revenue.
"Up to this far even other companies, they're flocking to the Eastern Cape and mainly because Coega is heading most of the projects here in the Eastern Cape and then it has helped our business to grow as well.
Transnet's long-term plan for Ngqura includes increasing the total number of berths to more than 30, and boosting the port's capacity to 1.5 million containers per year.
As the port expands, watery waves will continue lapping at the ship's hulls and businesses hope they will see continued waves of growth in the local economy.
