(CNN) -- If you're still querying any economic freeze between Russia and the West, digest this line from VTB bank the day Europe's sanctions took effect: The European Union "have gone against their own interests to do the bidding of their senior colleagues from across the ocean," the Russian financial giant said.
And the European branches of Russia's big banks can still operate as normal.
Industrial and engineering giant Siemens has said it sees a "serious risk" to European growth as a result of the sanctions.
The Times has reported oligarchs are contemplating suing the EU or the individual governments to remove them from sanctions lists, and the best place for that is London's High Court.
That, in turn, could put a chill on European firms doing deals in Russia even if they are is not impacted by sanctions.
An economic cold wind, if not war, is certainly blowing through the financial capitals of Europe.
