Sixteen-time grand slam winner Federer hailed Ljubicic, who won a bronze medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics, as a fearsome opponent, but said the time was right for the 32-year-old to hang up his racket.
He's been a wonderful friend to me on tour, and it's also been very beneficial to the game of tennis, not just on the court but off the court because he's been part of the political system here.
"It's never an easy decision for any professional athlete to retire," said Ljubicic, whose most recent title came at Indian Wells in March 2010, an event which three-time champion Federer will play in next week.
Tennis has given me so much and I want to continue to stay involved and contribute in some ways."
