But when he saw the devastation in other areas of the country, he wanted to do all he could to help his fellow Filipinos.
Hendley, who has responded to humanitarian crises in Darfur, Haiti and Syria, had just started assessing how his nonprofit, Wine to Water, might help the Philippines when he received Penaflorida's e-mail.
Soon, Hendley was on a flight to the Philippines with hundreds of water filters in tow.
The next day, both men helped volunteers assemble the filters and pack 120,000 meals donated by Stop Hunger Now, one of Hendley's partner organizations.
Penaflorida said that the destruction was worse than he'd seen on television, but he soon found reason to take heart.
He originally planned to return home for the Thanksgiving holiday, but he now intends to stay until early December.
Penaflorida returned home Wednesday to focus on a new project: bringing his pushcart classrooms to the devastated areas to help educate children while the communities rebuild.
Hendley now plans to provide water filters to Lim so she can distribute them to the women and children she is helping.
The group, founded by 2012 CNN Hero Jake Wood, has 43 volunteers in the Philippines providing medical care, opening supply lines and helping repair a field hospital in an area west of Tacloban.
You can support relief efforts in the Philippines through Penaflorida's Dynamic Teen Company or Hendley's Wine to Water or by visiting CNN's Impact Your World.
