That's how Utah County Sheriff Jim Tracy described a high-speed, bullet-riddled rampage that went on for 50 miles across two counties, until officers were able to corner a suspect.
Tracy knew him well and thought highly of him, he told journalists at a news conference.
Wride called in a "motorist assist" when he decided to pull off the road to aid what he thought was a disabled vehicle, Tracy said.
"He may have very well parked by the side of the road, hoping that some officer would stop behind him," he said.
Seconds later, the officer was shot in his vehicle, wounded in the head, Tracy said.
When deputies caught up with him, the man fired at them, critically wounding yet another deputy, the sheriff's office said.
"He was a good man," the sheriff said.
