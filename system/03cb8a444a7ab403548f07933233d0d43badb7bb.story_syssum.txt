He told them, "I want to collect your paint and take it someplace where people don't have access to paint.
He recently returned from Equatorial Guinea, where he donated 200 gallons of paint to an orphanage for children who lost their parent to HIV/AIDS.
Those looking to donate their leftover paint can visit the website of the group, GlobalPaints.Org, and fill out a request for a pickup.
I think he's taken something very difficult for people to do correctly, that's recycling paint and created a way to do it and do it safely.
"I was really excited to hear about Global Paint and the use for the paint in Third World nations because we have such a hard time getting rid of paint, and this kills two birds with one stone.
After picking up the paint, Delgarde drives to one of three storage units.
Delgarde says that the calls for paint donations have grown from 12 weekly to between 300 and 400 hundred per day.
Students from Georgia Tech have partnered with Global Paint to design a machine that can process the paint.
Delgarde recalls a letter that he received from a woman in Uganda who received paint.
To me, that touched my heart."
