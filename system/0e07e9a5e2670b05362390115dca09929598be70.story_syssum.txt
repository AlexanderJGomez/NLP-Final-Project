I have seen it growing -- more buildings, hotels and lots of architecture being constructed all the time.
I think it is always important to see the original Dubai, how it used to be, and a lot of it is still there.
Our job was to build more and I think Dubai has that balance where there are the old and the new areas.
Sometimes an old Emirati man will come and whisper in my ear: "Isn't this a gargour (traditional fishing trap made of steel)?"
There are a couple of old buildings that are turned into art spaces.
My mum would get fabrics and I think this was where my interest in art and colors started.
People were interacting with it really nicely, asking questions as they saw it moving around, others thought he must have lost his way from the souq and that is what I wanted to achieve.
This is an example of how I tend to do my work -- take something from our past that is still used in our present and then redesign it in a new form and give it a new function -- and most of the time it is an artistic function -- to reintroduce it again.
It is less challenging when you are a woman because they always think that art is your feminine side.
I think collaborations are very powerful because they mix the media from different backgrounds and when you put them together there are a lot of unexpected results.
