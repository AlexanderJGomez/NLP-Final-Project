The al Qaeda leader also passed on orders for ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and his followers to focus on the fight in Iraq, where sectarian violence has reached the highest levels in more than five years, often pitting Sunnis, a minority in Iraq, against Shiite Muslims.
Al Qaeda splinter group ISIS this week staged bodies to look like they were crucified in the northern Syrian city of Raqqa.
The group carried out seven public executions in Raqqa on Tuesday, but only two bodies were displayed afterward, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
In the first part of the interview, which was posted online two weeks ago, al-Zawahiri insisted al Qaeda is holding strong and, in fact, "expanding" 13 years after the United States launched its "war on terror" following the September 11, 2001, attacks.
