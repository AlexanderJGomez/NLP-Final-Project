(CNN) -- On a cold morning in February, 10 days after undergoing in vitro fertilization, Carolyn Savage lay in bed at her Ohio home waiting for the results of her pregnancy test.
In a tragic mix-up, the Savages say the fertility clinic where Carolyn underwent in vitro fertilization implanted another couple's embryos into Carolyn's uterus.
After receiving the news, Sean hung up the phone and drove straight home to tell his wife in person.
At the time, Carolyn was 39 and her chances of having a child naturally after this one were waning.
Their second child, born almost three years later in 1997, was 10 weeks premature after Carolyn developed life-threatening complications.
Yet after she recovered, the Savages consulted with a doctor and remained intent on pursuing future pregnancies.
With five embryos left over from IVF -- and despite the risks to Carolyn's health -- the Savages, guided by their religious beliefs, refused to let the unused embryos at the clinic languish.
After learning about the mistake, the Savages made two decisions right away: They would not abort the baby, and when he was born, they would relinquish the baby to his DNA parents.
"We knew based on legal precedent that custody would be lost, and we agree with that precedent," said Carolyn, alluding to a similar case of errant IVF in 1999 in New York in which custody was awarded to the genetic parents.
The Savages say the five embryos they originally had cryogenically preserved at the clinic in Ohio are still unused and have been moved to another clinic in Atlanta, Georgia.
"I know that tug will be there every day wondering if the baby's happy, healthy and OK," said Carolyn.
