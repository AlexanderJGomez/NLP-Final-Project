Merah, a French citizen of Algerian descent, had been put under surveillance after trips to Afghanistan and Pakistan, officials have said, leading commentators to ask why he was not stopped sooner.
Aicha claimed that Merah had beaten up her daughter, 19 at the time, and held her son, 15, against his will in a room for several hours, forcing him to watch videos of violent combat and of people's throats being slit.
Crowds gathered in a square in central Toulouse at noon Friday to remember those killed in the attacks.
A police cordon surrounding the property was removed in the afternoon, exposing the messy aftermath of the gun siege to those at the scene.
Fillon said the French domestic intelligence service, the DCRI, had done its job "perfectly well, it identified Mohammed Merah when he traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan, it questioned him and it monitored him, he was under surveillance, on a list, and it was thanks to that listing that he was identified.
He spoke Thursday as campaigning resumed for the French presidential election, with the first round of voting due next month.
The day after his third and final attack, on a Jewish school, Merah was tracked down to an apartment in Toulouse, where a siege began in the early hours Wednesday.
After Merah's death, Sarkozy said everything had been done to bring him to justice alive but security forces could not be exposed to further risk.
Merah was sentenced 15 times by a Toulouse juvenile court when he was a minor, Molins said.
Four days later, two other soldiers were shot dead and another injured by a black-clad man wearing a motorcycle helmet in a shopping center in the city of Montauban, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Toulouse.
The other victim, the daughter of the school's director, was killed in front of her father.
