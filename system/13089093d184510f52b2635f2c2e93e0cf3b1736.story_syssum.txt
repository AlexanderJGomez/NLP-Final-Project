Comanche, arguably the world's most hotly-anticipated yacht, has finally taken to the seas and for its billionaire owner Jim Clark, it's a chunk of money that could land him a place in the record books.
You're just praying the boat stays in one piece and that's a realistic fear with such a cutting-edge project like this."
Designed by Van Peteghem Lauriot Prevost (VPLP) and Guillame Verdier, Comanche's creation has been fast track, the build itself usually expected to take two years but, in this instance, crammed into just one with up to 40 workers on hand.
His other yacht, Athena, is currently moored in Monaco and up for sale at $75m.
The target is to win such events as the Transatlantic, Transpac, Fastnet and Middle Sea while breaking records in the process, before selling Commanche in two years.
Clark tells the story of going out on the first Wild Oats, Bob Oatley's boat that has dominated the Sydney to Hobart race, and being blown away by the technology of a keel boat.
The 1998 edition of the race remains infamous for the freak weather conditions that struck and left six people dead.
The race is part of the Australian sporting psyche, on a par with the Melbourne Cup, the Australian Open tennis or an Ashes cricket Test match between Australia and England.
For Read, Comanche and its crew, Sydney-Hobart will be something of a trip into the unknown but with the technology on board and money spent, Read is all too aware that the expectation will be high in subsequent races.
Read and the Clarks have become close friends during their time together, Clark's only regret as a septuagenarian is that he is no longer young enough to be on board in some of Comanche's tougher races.
I'll let her run the show."
