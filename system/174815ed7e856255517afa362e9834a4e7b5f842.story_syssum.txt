Even as a kid brand-new to the staff and brand-new to the newspaper business, hired to work during summer vacations, I could tell that.
One night in the summer of 1967 the phone on the sports desk rang and I picked it up with the customary: "Sports!"
"Now, I've seen your name in the paper," the caller said.
"Now, I believe I know your mother and father," the caller said.
"When you answer a business telephone, the proper way to do it is to tell the caller your name first."
"You don't want to disappoint them by giving a bad impression of yourself on the telephone, do you?"
I knew it really was the head coach of the Ohio State University football team because of that phrase early in his lecture to me -- "To whom am I speaking?"
He may have been the most nationally famous person in the community, but he was first and foremost a member of that community -- during all his years as head football coach at Ohio State, Woody kept his home telephone number listed in the Columbus phone book: W.W. Hayes, on Cardiff Road.
It seemed that very early in Jack Nicklaus's golf career, Nicklaus's father, Charlie, a Columbus pharmacist, was following his son on tour, and Woody Hayes offered to travel with Charlie Nicklaus to keep him company and provide moral support.
Woody Hayes and Charlie Nicklaus were two Columbus residents on the road to cheer for a local golfer; the fact that the local golfer would become the greatest ever to play the game was incidental.
