ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Taliban militants made their deepest incursion into Pakistan this week, seizing control of areas that are a short drive from the capital city.
Those warheads, however, are unassembled and scattered about Pakistan in areas that are not under the control of the Taliban, several analysts said.
Analyst Michael Krepon said while the news out of Pakistan is "disturbing," the real concern is what happens if Pakistan decides to move the weapons components, which are closely guarded by its army.
"The threat to nuclear weapons is not so imminent because they are far away from those places and secondly, they are under control of the army," Rizvi said.
The January 26, 2008 news conference took place a few weeks after IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei warned that Pakistan's "many internal problems" put the country's nuclear arms at much greater risk.
"In Pakistan we have been extremely conscious of our responsibilities and obligations in this regard and we have instituted command and control structures and security measures in a manner so as to make these fool proof," Kidwai said.
