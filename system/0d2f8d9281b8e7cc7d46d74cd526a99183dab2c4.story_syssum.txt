In the equivalent of 16 Formula One races completed back to back, the professional drivers take on treacherous night conditions and the risk of an accident with one of the amateur entries -- one ex-Formula One star ended last weekend's race in hospital after a spectacular spill.
The La Sarthe circuit in the heart of the French countryside is a Mecca for motorsport fans, and the race provides a unique challenge for competitors that ranks alongside F1's Monaco Grand Prix and the United States' Indianapolis 500 as the sport's blue riband events.
The drivers of the 35 cars that finished last weekend's race certainly earned a rest -- and a shoulder-rub or two -- in the days that follow Le Mans.
"At night it feels like a video game," said former F1 driver Karun Chandhok, after becoming the first Indian to race at Le Mans.
Audi's entries put on an ultimate show of strength for their brand, powering to all three overall podium places and the manufacturer's 11th Le Mans win in 12 years.
Toyota, whose two cars were unfortunate non-finishers, had returned to Le Mans for the first time in 13 years to showcase the Japanese firm's petrol-electric hybrid technology.
"Motor shows are irrelevant for fans, we need to get to our customers and be close to the fans on and off the track at events like this," said the general manager of Nissan Europe, Darren Cox.
Le Mans is a brilliant event to "endure" with relish -- but perhaps it's a relief that it comes but once a year.
