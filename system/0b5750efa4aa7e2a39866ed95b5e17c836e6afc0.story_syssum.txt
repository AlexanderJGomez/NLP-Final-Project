Released this week, the National Sleep Foundation's annual poll estimated that Americans get an average of about 6.7 hours of sleep during a weekday.
Over the last decade, the poll indicates that a growing percentage of Americans is getting less than six hours of sleep and the number of people who get eight or more hours is dwindling.
The findings echo a survey conducted by the American Psychological Association, which reported last year that 52 percent of 7,000 respondents were losing sleep at night from stress.
People are able to be active at any time from anywhere, and it causes people to be more active around the clock.
Centuries ago, people routinely slept eight to nine hours a day, he said.
But now, only about a quarter in the survey reported getting eight or more hours of sleep.
John Robinson, a sociology professor at the University of Maryland, challenged the notion that people are sleeping less in the 24-7 treadmill of modern life.
Robinson, a past director of the Americans' Use of Time Project, monitored time-use diaries to track how people spend their day.
The Sleep Foundation's annual findings are based on a telephone survey of 1,000 people in which the participants are asked to estimate the number of hours they usually sleep.
The time use surveys may overestimate sleep, because sleeplessness such as insomnia, tossing and turning and lying awake are categorized as sleep, said Dr. Chris Drake, clinical psychologist at Henry Ford Hospital Sleep Disorders and Research Center in Detroit, Michigan.
And modern society gets some of the blame.
"Our society has valued people who brag about being able to function on very little sleep as a mark of someone who is aggressive, dynamic, successful," Kavey said.
