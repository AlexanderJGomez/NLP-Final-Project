Two armed men were coming upstairs from our basement, having searched it without permission, and others were demanding that we tell them the location of my ex-husband, with whom I had not lived for several years.
They refused to identify themselves or show a warrant, and they put their hands on their guns when we tried to move.
It didn't seem to matter to the agents whether they found the person they were looking for or if frightened people in the home could not produce papers.
We are proud of this accomplishment, even though we know that home raid operations have continued in the Obama era, most notably in Tennessee and Alabama, where Latinos report ICE engaging in the very same unconstitutional behavior that traumatized my family.
They were arrested because many ICE agents were operating under a quota policy that gave credit for arrests of any undocumented person, not just the target.
ICE invaded the home of another family in our case twice in little more than a year, because when agents didn't find their target the first time, they didn't bother to record the mistake.
As the country debates immigration reform and enforcement, we owe it to ourselves to hold ICE's leaders and agents accountable and to make sure that they are subject to the same laws as everyone else.
