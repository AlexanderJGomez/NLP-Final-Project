Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- The numbers tell a small part of the story: Eight dead in a bomb blast.
It's not so much the sight of papers fluttering out of the shattered windows of office buildings, or even the red cables sticking out of the ripped concrete pavement.
The insistent alarm bell ringing a three-second warning, pausing as if for breath, and ringing again.
And finally, the siren of a single ambulance, long after the explosion that smashed Norway's calm.
He grabbed a camera and started filming on the spot.
The resulting video shows central Oslo littered with street signs ripped out of the ground by the blast, insulation torn from buildings, and people wandering in shock.
Smoke rises over a building in the near distance.
And rings.
