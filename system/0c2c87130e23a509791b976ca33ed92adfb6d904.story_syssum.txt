And of course at this stage, it's unclear how many Palestinian casualties there have been in these locations.
This is part of the picture of the Israelis going into heavily populated areas -- which is a much more dangerous operation, as can be seen by the deaths of at least 13 Israeli soldiers on Sunday.
Whenever Israel comes up with new tactics, Hamas and other factions seem to find new ways to counter them, such as by using longer-range rockets to fire at Israel, for example.
How soon before it realistically is better described as a war?
If this crisis is to end soon, Israel will have to pull back and Hamas needs to stop firing rockets.
I was on the streets of Gaza on Sunday night, when Palestinians celebrated the claims that an Israeli soldier had been captured.
The immediate conclusion of everyone in the street was that this was Israel's response to the capture of one of its soldiers.
After one of his deputies mentioned the latest number of Palestinian casualties, Kerry was heard to say, "It's a hell of a pinpoint operation."
This is why Kerry may be feeling uncomfortable -- he spent almost a year trying to forge a Mideast peace deal, and what's he got to show for it now?
