Venus Williams steps off the tennis court and into the pool in a series of photos to be featured in Italian Marie Claire.
"I've got it pictured in my mind that she's going to be playing tennis underwater," Bolofo told CNN.
"I'm excited it's my first underwater tennis venture, so I feel a little nervous, but I think I'll come through," Venus said.
I refuse to do this on the computer.
Venus' status in the ranks of the world's top tennis players gives her a unique position to be able to market her products and she often wears them on court.
Fame has never been my focus and I don't really try to grow it at all," she said.
"I've got it on my computer, all the different instrumentals, the different versions, the different cuts.
While tennis remains her prime obsession, Venus told CNN it's not the most important thing in her life.
And doing what God requires of me -- that's always a learning experience day in and day out," she said.
