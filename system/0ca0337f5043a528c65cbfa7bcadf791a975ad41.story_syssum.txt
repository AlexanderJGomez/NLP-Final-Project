"In the meantime, we should not do anything counterproductive that might shatter Western unity on this issue -- we should make sure that if the talks fail, it was Iran that caused their failure," Johnson said in remarks prepared for a Banking Committee hearing on the issue Thursday.
"We see today that that the Iranians are launching a rocket next week, and though this was supposedly made as their space program, it's well known that this is just a cover for military ballistic weapons program," Menendez said at Thursday's hearing.
"I think that a provocative action in the midst of such negotiations should be interpreted as a sign of bad faith, and only reaffirms in our mind why we need to proceed with some efforts here."
"Even if the sanctions are not imposed, it implies a lack of faith in the process and an unwillingness to play by the rules that our partners are playing by," Kerry said.
"Now that Iran has come to the table and entered into this first step agreement, I believe this may well be the last best chance to resolve this crisis by diplomacy, and so the President is absolutely right to fully test Iran's leaders," Johnson said.
The country is also forbidden from turning on additional machines used in enrichment, and must submit to what Kerry has described as "unprecedented international monitoring" of its nuclear program.
"Today's actions should be a stark reminder to businesses, banks and brokers everywhere that we will continue relentlessly to enforce our sanctions, even as we explore the possibility of a long-term, comprehensive resolution of our concerns with Iran's nuclear program," he said.
