Al-Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes and genocide, but he has eluded arrest.
Al-Bashir made trips abroad for meetings despite the ICC warrants against him crimes in the Darfur region, where rebels have fought government forces and allied militiamen such as the Janjaweed since 2003.
"Malawi joins an increasing number of countries that have declined to welcome al-Bashir," said Alan Wallis, international justice lawyer at the Southern Africa Litigation Center, quoted by Human Rights Watch.
"Civil society groups across the African continent have repeatedly urged governments to arrest -- not host -- al-Bashir," said Elise Keppler, senior international justice counsel at Human Rights Watch.
