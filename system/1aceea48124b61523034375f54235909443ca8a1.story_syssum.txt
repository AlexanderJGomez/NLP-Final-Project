Schaffner is seen in a police mug shot after his arrest Saturday in Kingdom City, Missouri.
Lakey, who was staying at the motel, said he remembered seeing news reports about a man sought in a string of bank robberies, so he looked on the Web site of the television show "America's Most Wanted" to check a vehicle description in the case.
Schaffner is suspected in 14 robberies of various types in six states, FBI Special Agent Brian Truchon told CNN on Sunday.
Schaffner was identified as a suspect last month after investigators posted surveillance photos from the robberies on electronic billboards throughout the South.
So we want to get this guy in custody before he harms anyone."
A woman in Morristown, Tennessee, also told authorities Schaffner hid in her apartment in August and threatened to kill her children if she revealed his whereabouts, according to documents filed in federal court.
The billboards began showing images from the robberies on August 24, and the next day, a man told the FBI that Schaffner was in the Morristown area at the time of the August 18 holdups.
He had threatened to kill the children if she told agents he was there, the woman said.
