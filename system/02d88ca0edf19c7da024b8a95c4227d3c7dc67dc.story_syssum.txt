Since January 2015, every month has set a record in sea lion "strandings," mostly sea lion pups, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Greenman said he expects the problem to continue beyond April, when weaning normally occurs, when the pups are 10 or 11 months old.
Greenman said California has had warmer weather than usual this year, and, while NOAA is still conducting studies on the Channel Islands to get a more proven explanation, warmer water drives the food source farther out or deeper into the ocean, where the colder water is.
People who observe stranded sea lions are advised not to touch them or attempt to rescue them, because it can be dangerous and it is illegal.
Instead, call any of the rescue agencies listed on NOAA West Coast Region's website.
