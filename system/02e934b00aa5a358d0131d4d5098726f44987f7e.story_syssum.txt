The Frenchwoman won the Paris Indoor Open earlier this year, but it proved to be a false dawn in her return to top form and she skipped the final two tournaments of 2009.
I made this decision after careful consideration," she told reporters at an emotional press conference on Thursday.
Mauresmo claimed her first major win at the Australian Open when Justine Henin pulled out with injury during the final, but she defied her doubters by beating the Belgian to claim the Wimbledon title later that year.
Henin and her compatriot have both ended their relatively brief retirements this year, but Mauresmo said she was unlikely to have a similar change of mind.
But her career came off the rails in 2007, missing two months due to injury and finishing outside the top-10 for the first time in seven seasons.
