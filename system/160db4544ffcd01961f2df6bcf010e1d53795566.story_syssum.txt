(CNN) -- By many eyewitness accounts, when US Airways flight 1549 crashed into the Hudson River, it looked like a completely normal landing -- except it was in the water.
"I saw an airplane landing in the middle of the water, but very calm," she said.
And according to many iReporters, who described the situation to CNN as it unfolded, the rescue operation looked as smooth as the landing -- but, of course, just as scary.
Police boats and helicopters arrived shortly after, he said.
"It wasn't chaos -- a lot of times when things like this happen, people are running around or yelling."
...There seems to be even more emergency crews in the water and hovering above than an hour ago," he said.
Lisa Speransky, who also watched the situation from her office window, says workers appeared to tether the plane to boats to prevent it sinking.
"They must have gotten a rope around the plane at some point, because they were turning it around and dragging it towards New Jersey," she wrote in an email.
He lives in New Jersey but was in Manhattan when the plane went down, and said his first thought after seeing the plane go down was to get back home, thinking that the state's border might be closed in case of terrorism.
"What's peculiar is I look to my left and there's where the World Trade Center used to be and I look to my right and there's a plane in the water," he said.
