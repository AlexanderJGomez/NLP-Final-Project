A follow-up to the original "Kid Icarus" title that came out 25 years ago, this new version offers updated graphics, classic boss battles and humorous dialogue that, unfortunately, quickly becomes cheesy and trite.
Fortunately, the game comes packed with a nifty stand, because trying to hold and maneuver gameplay was quite the contortion.
On the ground (because apparently this angel has a limit on how much he can fly), Pit navigates through a series of rooms and pathways, defeating enemies and collecting hearts.
The intensity of each chapter can change as well, ramping up the enemies and the loot.
One nice feature is that some weapons can be fused with other weapons to create even more powerful attacks.
There are plenty of silly pop-culture references that don't quite work in this mythological setting: "Happy meal of pain"?
The gameplay is good, and the story does move along at a brisk pace.
It is rated E 10+ for everyone 10 years old and older due to comic mischief, fantasy violence, and mild suggestive themes.
