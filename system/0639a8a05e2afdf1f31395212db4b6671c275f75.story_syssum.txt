Her stage career began in 1951 in her native Sydney in a production of "Judith" by Eugene Goossens, according to a spokesman with her recording company, Decca Records.
Her last stage appearance was with both performers in Act 2 of "Die Fledermaus" at The Royal Opera House in London, England's Covent Garden on December 31, 1989.
She resurrected a number of forgotten works and gave them new life on the stage and in the recording studio, including Massenet's "Le roi de Lahore" and "Esclarmonde," the latter being a favorite of hers.
She is survived by her husband; her son Adam and daughter-in-law Helen; and two grandchildren, Natasha and Vanya.
