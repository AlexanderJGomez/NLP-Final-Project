Ten years after the first detainees were brought to Guantanamo from what was considered the battlefield in Afghanistan after 9/11, constitutional and judicial experts held a news conference Wednesday to say the Obama administration needs to restore American values of human rights and the rule of law.
"There is no case that is so important that we should sacrifice our dedication to human rights and rule of law," Hutson said.
"I believed at the time that we were committed to having full, fair and open trials," Davis said.
Talat Hamdani, a Muslim American whose son died in the attacks on World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, spoke at the rally in front of the White House.
"Guantanamo is a shame -- a disgrace for our nation and we need to set the record straight by leading by example."
