"The White Ribbon," by Austrian director Michael Haneke, was awarded the prize for its depiction of the cruel punishments meted out at a rural German school before the First World War.
"There are always rumors at the festival, and one must not take them seriously," the director said.
"I think I always loved him as a director, and that's why I've worked with him before," she said at the post-awards press conference.
"It was like being on "Big Brother," except you could go to the movies," added British screenwriter and fellow juror Hanif Kureishi.
The jury prize was shared by Korean auteur Park Chan-Wook's vampire film "Thirst," and Andrea Arnold's "Fish Tank," while the grand prix went to "The Prophet," by director Jacques Audiard.
