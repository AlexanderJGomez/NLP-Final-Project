It was the earliest defeat for Federer in a tournament this year, ending his hopes of claiming the Monte Carlo title for the first time after being beaten three times in the final by Rafael Nadal.
The second followed a similar pattern, with Federer unable to capitalize on his seven break points in the match as the seventh seed went through.
Federer shrugged off his defeat as he now takes a two-week break before the Madrid Masters in his build-up to the French Open next month.
There was no stopping world number one Rafael Nadal, bidding for his seventh straight title in Monte Carlo, as he swept aside Croatian Ivan Ljubicic 6-1 6-3 to reach the last four.
