The spokesman said the mini bus, which was not an official tour bus, became lost near the stadium and "ended up at the wrong part of the ground".
Police were quick to arrive and the bus managed to move on to safety, where the fan was treated for the wound, he said.
Last month ten football fans were shot dead in the south of Nigeria on the way to support their team.
In 2003 five England fans suffered gunshot wounds during a violent incident in Zurich, Switzerland, before the side played a Euro 2004 qualifier with Liechtenstein.
