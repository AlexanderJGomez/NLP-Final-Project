Obama and Clinton were to appear together Monday night at three New York City fundraisers, which are expected to bring in millions of dollars.
"Clinton just wants to help," a source close to the former president said.
I think it really -- I think a president ought to have done something for other people and for his country when you pick a president," Clinton said.
In early 2008, when Obama won the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses and emerged as a real contender, he entered into an all-out feud with the former first couple.
And he's looked to Bill Clinton for help since taking office, hosting him at the White House during contentious negotiations with Congress in December 2010.
"There's no question that in terms of getting up and going to the office and, you know, basically performing the essential functions of the office, the man who has been governor and had a sterling business career crosses the qualification threshold."
