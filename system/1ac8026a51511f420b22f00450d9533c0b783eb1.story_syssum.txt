(CNN) -- A teenage mother and her young daughter, snatched off a Cleveland street, were found shot to death in a garage early Sunday, Cleveland, Ohio, police said.
The brother, who CNN is not identifying because of his age, ran home and called 911.
The alert named Lorde, 25, as the kidnapping suspect, warning that he was a "violent sexual predator with felony warrants out of New York," and armed and dangerous.
No other details of the investigation were made public.
