The suspect in the foreground replies in a fearful voice, "I swear to you that I don't know anything about it."
The video was shot in the town of General Guemes in the northwestern Argentine province of Salta.
"Torture is a common tool which is applied constantly in many detention centers and even to suspects held at police station cells before their court appearance," Verdu said.
It is estimated as many as 30,000 people were killed or disappeared during the country's military dictatorship, the period known as the Dirty War, which lasted from 1976 until 1983.
