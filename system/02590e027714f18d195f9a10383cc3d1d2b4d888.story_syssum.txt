Warner Bros.' new baseball drama 42 topped the box office with $27.3 million — far ahead of recent baseball titles like Moneyball ($19.5 million debut) and Trouble with the Curve ($12.2 million).
According to Warner Bros., a surprisingly high 52 percent of the opening weekend crowd was female.
Warner Bros. says it plans on expanding the film from its already-wide 3,002 theater count next weekend.
Part of the reason for Scary Movie 5's sub-par performance may have to do with the fact that it arrived in theaters a full seven years after Scary Movie 4, which earned $40.2 million in its opening weekend in 2006.
Fox's hit animated family film The Croods dropped by a slightly larger-than-expected 36 percent in its fourth weekend to $13.2 million.
Joe: The Rise of Cobra's $150.2 million total, it's making up ground overseas, where it has earned $168.3 million — ahead of Cobra's $152.3 million international finish.
Rounding out the Top 5 was last weekend's champ, Evil Dead, which plummeted 63 percent to $9.5 million.
The Croods -- $13.2 million
In limited release, the Ryan Gosling/Bradley Cooper drama The Place Beyond the Pines successfully expanded into 514 theaters, where it grossed $4.1 million, good for a strong $7,937 location average.
Oblivion's strongest markets included Russia ($8.6 million), the U.K. and Ireland ($7.9 million), and France ($3.9 million).
