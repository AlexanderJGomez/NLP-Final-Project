"I didn't run to be pope, I ran to be mayor," said the usually blunt Barry, who rejected any suggestion that his most notable fall from power two decades ago was a scandal.
A recent poll showed that the veteran of the Civil Rights movement who was first elected to public office in the 1970s and currently holds down a City Council seat, is now the most popular local politician in the District of Columbia.
Barry added that scandal can make a politician resilient and better suited for the rough and tumble of public life.
"Barry is the personification of everything that is bad government, a persona that overwhelms the political system."
Plotkin has known Barry for decades and said his best asset is his ability to calculate who votes and how to play to that group.
It surfaced this year that Gray knew in January that members of his staff had not properly reported funds raised for his 2010 campaign, according to a source close to a federal investigation of his campaign funding.
To this day -- after the 1990 drug conviction, a six-month jail sentence, and a 2005 guilty plea to misdemeanor tax charges -- Barry denies that he ever had a political scandal.
"Million of Americans don't file their taxes," Barry said.
