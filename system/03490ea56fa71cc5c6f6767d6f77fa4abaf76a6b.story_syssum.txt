(CNN) -- If you're walking along the east African coast and chance upon a herd of brightly-striped elephants, flame-hued rhinos and a tower of crazily-colored giraffes, then don't panic, you're not hallucinating -- and neither have you stumbled on a psychedelic new species, sorry.
Affordable and convenient, they are worn by both children and adults alike, as well as by scores of tourists visiting the white sand beaches in east Africa.
At the same time, countless of non-degradable flip-flops and other plastic waste ends up on the same shores, brought there by powerful currents from places as far away as China and Indonesia.
The inspiration for Ocean Sole came in 1997 when Church, a marine conservationist at the time, started working in a sea turtle preservation project on the remote island of Kiwayu near the Kenya-Somalia border.
It works with more than 10 suppliers who collect the raw material from waterways in and around Nairobi, as well as from the Kenyan coastline, and deliver it to the company's workshop.
There, Ocean Sole workers go through large bags full of broken flip-flops every day to select the ones they're going to use in their creations.
"Certainly about the ocean, doing that through the business of recycling rubber that floats," she continues, "and doing it independently in a relative sustainable and grown up way where you have to have a market and a good product, you've got to be commercial," adds Church.
