The mazelike corridors of the magnificent Mikhailovsky Theatre in St Petersburg prove confusing and inspire a few unchoregraphed twists and turns from Duato before he finally identifies the right room and his new company -- the 140 dancers of the Mikhailovsky Ballet.
While performances at the Mikhailovsky are well attended, there's a growing concern that Russians may become tired of seeing the standard repertoire of classical ballets.
That goes without saying, but the attitude that exists towards Russian ballet in the West is more passionate," said Vladimir Kekhman, billionaire fruit importer and General Director of the Mikhailovsky Theatre.
"I looked within our industry to see who were considered living legends of choreography, and when I looked within Russia, I realized that we didn't have choreographers who had the ability to not just choreograph, but also head the company," he said.
Bringing a modern approach to ballet in Russia, where it's ingrained in the culture might daunt some, but it's a task Duato is relishing.
It really is a pleasure to be in a place where ballet (has been) part of the cultural tradition for (such a) long time, and at the same time they want to break through and do new things," Duato said.
Opening night will be a litmus test of just how receptive Russians are to this new direction.
Duato believes ballet is a living organism, which needs to evolve constantly in order to keep the audience interested.
