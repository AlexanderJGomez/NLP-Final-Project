The steady drumbeat of preparations for some sort of a U.S. strike in Syria is stirring up old anxieties.
1) Other dictators are watching: When the president of the United States says the use of chemical weapons is a "red line," other dangerous regimes pay very close attention to see what he means.
The message that America's warnings can be ignored, that the international community's warnings can be disregarded, is most welcome in places like Iran and North Korea, whose pursuits of weapons are a threat not just to the United States but to the entire world.
Chemical weapons are not only appealing to dictators refusing to relinquish power, but they also could make an appearance in other wars, and they are ideal for terrorist groups seeking to inflict maximum fear.
Failure to do so resulted in today's terrible dearth of good choices, in which America wants al-Assad to fall, but the opposition is  dominated by extremist jihadists, some of them affiliated with al Qaeda.
This is the last place to allow a wildfire to spread before trying to affect its direction and ultimately extinguish it.
Without forceful American action, al-Assad's latest maneuvers constitute a victory for his regime and its top allies, Iran and Hezbollah.
Even if you don't care about Syria or the Middle East, handing a victory to this dangerous threesome should worry everyone.
It all started as a peaceful uprising demanding a dictator step down and allow a democratic government representing the different religions and ethnicities in Syria.
The United States and its friends should strike al-Assad in a way that shows the world will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons, and prove that America's threats and international commitments have meaning and muscle.
Then they can remove al-Assad from power by wining what is, most assuredly, their war, the Syrians' war, but one that is of great consequence to America and to the rest of the world.
