Human skeletal remains found early Saturday in Pala -- a rural, rugged  area in northern San Diego County, California -- have been positively identified as those of DuBois, Police Chief Jim Maher of Escondido, California, said at a news conference.
The investigation is being handled by Escondido police, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, and the FBI.
"We have been working closely with San Diego Sheriff's Office, and our investigators are working with theirs in case there is a connection," Lt. Robert Benton with the Escondido Police Department said last week.
Maher did not mention any suspects during his brief news conference Sunday.
