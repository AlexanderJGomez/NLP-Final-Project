Los Angeles (CNN) -- Johnny Depp brought the biggest star power to the MTV Movie Awards on Sunday, taking the stage to play guitar while he was honored for his acting career.
"Twilight" stars Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart won for best kiss, an honor they received for the previous installment as well.
She and her ensemble of castmates were honored for "best gut-wrenching performance," for the food poisoning in the dressing room scene.
It would take time to digest the significance of her new gold popcorn trophy, she said.
During a more serious part of the show, actress Emma Stone was brought to tears after she accepted the MTV Trailblazer Award.
She told her teenaged fans to harness their own originality.
