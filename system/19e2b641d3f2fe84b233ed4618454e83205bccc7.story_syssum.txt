The manifesto is a lengthy chronicle detailing Rodger's frustrations with his height, his parents' divorce and rejection by women.
According to Astaire, that's when Rodger's mother saw her son's latest video, called "Retribution," that he posted Friday, the day of the shootings.
It ended when Rodger slammed into a parked vehicle and apparently shot himself in the head, police said.
Six policemen showed up at his house in Isla Vista on April 30, but they found nothing alarming, so they told Rodger to call his mother and they reassured her that he was OK, according to Astaire.
In fact, Elliot Rodger himself wrote in the manifesto that he worried that someone had discovered his plan when the police visited.
He continued: "If they had demanded to search my room ... That would have ended everything.
Brown told reporters that Rodger suffered from an undisclosed mental health issue and was under the care of a variety of health care professionals.
He went to high school in Van Nuys, California, and met with a therapist "pretty much every day," Astaire said.
Astaire told CNN that Rodger never expressed any fascination with guns.
Rodger passed the background check needed to buy the firearm used in the shooting, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CNN.
