Earlier this week, CNN spoke to four protesters about their hopes, demands and expectations, from a veteran demonstrator in Cairo who has marched in crowds since the beginning of Egypt's revolution in 2011 to a first-time protester in the port city of Alexandria.
[The] square exploded with joy once protesters knew that Morsy was no longer the president.
The road map is what we have been calling for since [former Egyptian president] Mubarak's ousting.
There's a strong debate on whether what happened was a coup or a revolution.
[The] people must keep a close watch on those in power and take action if there's any deviation from their demands and goals.
The army acted very quickly to meet the increasing demands of the protesters to protect the country from slipping into violence and civil war between pro- and anti-Morsy protesters.
This army made it clear, by choosing a civilian to lead the interim process ... that the masses of people would not revolt back at the army as before.
We have finally relaxed now this bad group [of rulers] has finally ended [their time in power] -- my wife told me it's the same feeling you have after cleaning your house.
The people can do a lot to support their leaders -- they just need a guide, and the people will do miracles.
I'm one of the people who does not want the army to rule the country, so the interim president is the most suitable solution to avoid having the army ruling.
The people should observe the progress done [so far] -- and protest again if something goes wrong against their will.
