(CNN) -- The president of the Central African Republic has fled the country's capital and rebels have seized control of the city, a government official said Sunday.
Some South African soldiers were killed in clashes, according to a statement from the office of French President Francois Hollande.
The country has been on edge since rebel fighters pushed their way into the capital.
The rebel group, based in the country's north, managed to take control of several towns and move toward Bangui in the following weeks.
U.N. staff on the ground in Bangui are not allowed to leave the compound, Ikavi said, and non-essential staff will be evacuated or relocated once the security situation allows.
"No one can stay calm when you hear heavy shooting not far from the place that you are staying."
