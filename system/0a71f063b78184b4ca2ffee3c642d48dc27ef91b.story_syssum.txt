A 1961 firetruck loads up with water from a hydrant in Alabama to haul back to Orme, Tennessee.
Every day at 6 p.m., Orme Mayor Tony Reames turns a big valve to release water from the town's tank.
Just 150 miles to the southeast, the 4.5 million people who live in and around Atlanta, Georgia, are nervously watching water levels go down at their major reservoir.
Stevenson and New Hope, Alabama, also help out, occasionally bringing trucks full of water to the hydrant, where it's transferred to the Orme trucks.
A pipeline from Bridgeport is nearly complete, built with the help of a $378,000 grant from the federal government.
Reames said residents have found creative ways to conserve, flushing toilets with condensation water from air conditioners and undrinkable water from swimming pools that were filled early in the summer.
"Cherish the water you got and be kind of careful with it," Cash said, "because you never know if you will be out of water."
