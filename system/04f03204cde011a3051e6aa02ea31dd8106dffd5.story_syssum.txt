"It was about a mother who decided to give her child up for adoption because she couldn't stand to hear her crying from hunger," Cutler remembered.
"So many people have such an abundance, and so many others strive to afford even the basics," Cutler said.
The drive was a success, and she met many mothers in need and many mothers who wanted to help her build the organization.
"I wanted to assure these people who were donating so generously to us that these things were absolutely going into hands that needed them," she said.
Now she is able to push her 3-month-old daughter to day care before heading to her new job.
Cutler and her group aim to provide more than just goods to the moms they serve.
Volunteers offer support and guidance, giving recipients a sense of community they may not otherwise have.
"If what we're doing helps bridge the gap between people from different socioeconomic backgrounds, even in a small way, then it's definitely worth all the hard work."
