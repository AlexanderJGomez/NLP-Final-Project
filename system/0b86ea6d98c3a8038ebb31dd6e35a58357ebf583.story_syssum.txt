Stine has returned to the evil street that made him famous in the 1990s, and fans are looking forward to the new ways he'll terrorize Shadyside High School teenagers on "Fear Street."
"It's a great way to keep in touch with my original readers, and 'Fear Street' was mentioned more than anything else.
The new "Fear Street" arrives at a time many consider to be a renaissance of young adult horror.
Like today's TV shows, today's teen horror novels are darker and scarier than the "Fear Street" of the 1990s, reflecting the way popular culture has changed.
"The more subtle you go and leave for the reader to interpret, they can participate and it's even scarier."
Horror novels by Stine, Christopher Pike and Lois Duncan emerged as a salve to the 1970s and 1980s' "problem novels" that dealt with divorce, drugs and alcohol abuse.
Cat Winters, Kendare Blake, April Genevieve Tucholke and Kami Garcia are some of the authors folding in suspense and elements of psychological terror into horror novels.
Kenneth Oppel, author of a young Victor Frankenstein series, believes that part of the appeal of modern young adult horror is the shift away from crazed serial killers to demons within ourselves.
"It always seemed strange to me that there was no curiosity about what's going on behind the scenes of this creature," Marion said.
She thought it was fitting that the grandfather of teen horror revisit his most popular series for old fans and a new generation.
While the Stine "recipe" remains the same -- following one character's perspective closely -- Stine says the new "Fear Street" books will be longer, more adult and more violent, reflecting how young adult fiction has changed since the 1990s.
