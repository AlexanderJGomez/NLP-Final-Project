For some, the ending was all they could've asked for after sticking by the show for seven seasons.
If you were told before the final season that Stephen Moyer's Bill Compton wouldn't make it out alive, would you have believed it?
While Sookie's (Anna Paquin) feelings for Bill have definitely flip-flopped throughout the series, there was no doubting who had her heart last night.
His martyrdom and his speech were romantic, but then he asked Sookie, while she stood there crying over his impending death, to do the actual killing.
Apparently, there just wasn't enough time, not with Sookie donning a black dress to meet Bill at the graveyard for his funeral.
And then, after a time jump of roughly four years after Bill's death, the town of Bon Temps became a much brighter place.
Viewers never learn the identity of the man Sookie settled down with, but she ends the series pregnant and presumably in love.
As suspected, the pair didn't keep the Hepatitis-V cure a secret from the public, and instead started New Blood, a cure and replacement for TruBlood.
Whether or not the show lost steam during its seven-year run is irrelevant now.
