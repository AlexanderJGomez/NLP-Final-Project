(CNN) -- Singer Pink has confirmed what some have been speculating online for a while: she is eating for two these days.
"I'm terrified because she thinks it's a girl," she said.
After the breakup, Pink released the song "Please Don't Leave Me" that chronicles a love-hate relationship with a boyfriend she can't let go of.
The baby news comes a day after the singer released a compilation album, "Greatest Hits ...
So Far."
