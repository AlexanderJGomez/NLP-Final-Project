(UWIRE) -- A Web site developed this year that allows students to share old exams online is causing debate among professors about its ethical implications.
"I know that some teachers reuse past exams and it would be hard to have to write a new test for every class."
He said he is looking into expanding the site more to include universities and colleges across the country.
"I think looking at an old exam helps -- it at least gives the student an idea of how the teacher poses questions," Cozier said.
"The first professor that banned his exams said he wanted to ban them because he was copyrighting them and publishing them in a book, and that made total sense to me," Oral said.
She said the site might be OK only if students get permission from their teachers to post exams online.
Students shouldn't have to rely on old tests online to prepare for an exam from a new teacher, Hall said.
