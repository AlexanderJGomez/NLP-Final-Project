The 36-year-old had only just come off the bench when he reacted quickly to a flicked header by Benedikt Howedes from a Toni Kroos corner to grab the equalizer in the Group G game.
Germany started the second half brighter and Mario Gotze headed the opening goal -- which deflected in off his own knee -- in the 51st minute after a pin point cross from Thomas Muller.
He took another of Muller's records for Germany's all-time leading scorer when he grabbed his 69th goal in a 6-1 thrashing of Armenia in a World Cup warmup game earlier this month.
"It went backwards and forwards, Germany could have won it, we could have won it -- the point was fair," said Boateng, who plays for German club Schalke and represented the country's under-21 team before choosing the nation of his father.
