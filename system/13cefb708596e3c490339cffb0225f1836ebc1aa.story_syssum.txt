Chris Brown's assault trial has been delayed until Wednesday as lawyers regroup after the conviction of the singer's bodyguard, who was to have testified.
Prosecutors and the defense lawyer began a discussion about granting immunity to Hollosy that would protect the bodyguard from having testimony in the Brown trial from being used against him in his case.
Howard University student Jalen Garrison testified in the Hollosy trial that she and a friend were posing for photos on the sidewalk with Brown when Adams, her boyfriend, tried to snap his own photo with Brown.
A limousine driver testified he witnessed Brown and Hollosy hit Adams.
Adams, who said he earns about $200 a day working at a restaurant, acknowledged that he's suing Brown, potentially seeking millions of dollars for the assault.
Brown voluntarily entered a rehab program a day after being released from a Washington jail in October, but he was kicked out a few days later for "throwing a rock through his mother's car window" after a family session at the center, a probation report said.
Brown's probation officer reported at a February hearing that the singer "continues to make great improvement" in dealing with anger, stress and drugs, but the judge decided he could not go free until after his trial for the assault charge in Washington.
The rehab program told Brown to leave because of that statement and two other rules violations, the document said.
Brown had been working on a highway cleanup labor crew in Los Angeles three days a week to fulfill the 750 hours of service remaining in his probation requirements, his probation report said.
