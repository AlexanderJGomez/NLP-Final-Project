He stole from people; he ate from garbage cans; he got locked up in juvenile detention for breaking into a bike shop when he was trying to get something he could sell for money so he could eat.
He had few friends, most of them acquaintances of his mother or the other street kids, many of whom were in gangs.
"And although there were a lot of horrible things that happened, it's made me a stronger person."
As tears began to build, he talked about her steadying influence and how she was always there to pull him up or pull him back when he started messing up again.

His conversion to bobsledder came thanks to a friend who told him there was a new track in Park City where the U.S. team was training for the 2002 Winter Olympics.
One of the Olympic team members on the top U.S. four-man team tested positive for steroids, so Schuffenhauer was called into duty.
He and Savage had to solve a dilemma: either he would give up on the idea of another Olympics or he would go back to full-time training with the team.
But Savage is a nurse, and her salary wasn't enough to pay the mortgage on the home they bought shortly after they first met.
The bank kicked them out, and Savage and the kids moved into a rental while Schuffenhauer went away for seven months at a time.
He remained resolute that he would make the Olympics even though he was now an alternate.
In January, a healthy Schuffenhauer and his USA3 teammates went to a race in St. Moritz, Switzerland, with a very outside chance of qualifying for the Olympics.
