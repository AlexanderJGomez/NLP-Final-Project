Evil's master plan for the technology behind his newly announced Kindle Touch e-reader: It uses frickin' laser beams.
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has defended the lack of a touch screen on previous Kindle models, saying conventional touch displays produce reflections.
For that reason, the Kindle Touch relies on infrared sensors, which are stationed along the edges around the screen to detect when the user's finger touches a particular spot on the device's face, an Amazon spokeswoman said.
Sony's recent e-readers, including a new model that will hit stores next month, also have infrared on their bezels.
Another, Kindle Keyboard, costs $99 to $139 and looks just like its predecessor, the Kindle 3.
"We have many customers who tell us they don't want touch," Bezos reportedly said at the news conference in New York on Wednesday.
