Washington (CNN) -- Sen. Mark Udall accused the CIA of "lying" about the effectiveness of torture, called for the resignation of its director and blasted President Barack Obama's handling of the spy agency on the Senate floor Wednesday.
But Brennan pushed back, acknowledging in a statement that the CIA made "mistakes" but saying those techniques "did produce intelligence that helped thwart attack plans, capture terrorists, and save lives.
"One would think this administration is leading the effort to right the wrongs of the past and ensure the American people learn the truth about the CIA's torture program," Udall said.
For a while I worried that this administration would succeed in keeping this study entirely under wraps.
