His comments inspired Twitter users to tweet the hashtag #YesAllWomen: They shared examples of what "women must fear" even if "not all men" engage in those behaviors, according to the person believed to have created the hashtag Saturday.
The hashtag -- a response to the "not all men" defense sometimes used to deflect feminist arguments -- spread quickly on Twitter, zeroing in on the subtle and explicit signals that a woman's worth is based on her availability to men.
In 2011, the site launched as a place for people to share stories of gender-based harassment.
It has been tweeted more than 520,000 times in the past year, according to social Web search engine Topsy.
Even though #YesAllWomen grew as a counterpoint to the "not all men" argument, it's effective because it stands on its own, feminist media critic Rachel Sklar said.
In fact, Rodger's killing spree shows that men can also be victims of hostility toward women: Four men were among those killed, including his two roommates, "the biggest nerds I had ever seen," Rodger said.
It's an extreme case of something we see and experience regularly as part of our lives, but it's shocking and jarring and scary to see it taken to these lengths," said Sklar, who founded the women's network TheLi.st.
The hashtag also forced discussion of the intersection of mental illness and misogyny in violence against women, especially in mass shootings, which are overwhelmingly perpetrated by white men.
"While there's a lot of harm that can happen online, the Internet (has been) so fundamentally transformative for women and feminists," she said.
