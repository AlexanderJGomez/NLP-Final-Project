The jaunty little guy sports a Nova Scotia T-shirt, and while made in China, he reminds me of a lovely Canadian adventure lacking only in a real moose.
These are a collection of entertaining souvenirs that are, you might say, so bad, they're good.
I suppose I was looking for something that invoked an emotion that landed somewhere between a cringe and a laugh.
Seems reasonable, but consider the example of a German tourist who picks up an iPad while visiting New York's Apple Store.
There may be a life-size polar bear in a cowboy hat and hula skirt standing in front of a tourist shop that makes for memorable souvenir photos, and one could argue that any item is for sale if you make the right offer, but if it isn't specifically there to be sold, it doesn't count.
So it has to be tied to a place in a way more substantial than being outsourced for production.
