BA said the talks would not affect its negotiations in Spanish airline Iberia, with which it is already discussing a revenue deal with American Airlines.
The deal, which will not permit a takeover, revises current Australian law that currently limits a single foreign holding to 25 percent and a group maximum of 35 percent.
BA and Qantas have for many years co-operated on the so-called "Kangaroo Route" including sharing revenues on UK-Australia routes, Quest said.
Qantas has also faced its own troubles this year after one of its jetliners was damaged by a midair explosion over the South China Sea in July, forcing it to make an emergency landing.
