Louise Garris, who lives in the Oakcrest neighborhood of Arlington, Virginia, first noticed the mysterious phenomenon early this fall when doing yardwork beneath a canopy of large oak trees.
The mystery has found its way to the Internet, where a "No acorns this year" discussion on Topix.com yielded more than 180 comments from people reporting acorn disappearances as far away as Connecticut and North Carolina.
Last year Garris reported a bumper crop of acorns, which scientists say may be one clue to this year's scarcity.
"There are plenty of acorns in most of the state, but zero acorns in some pockets," he said.
Her group collects hardwood seeds and plants trees to protect rivers and streams in the Potomac River watershed.
If the shortage continues for several years, other forces might be at work.
At the Long Branch Nature Center, calls and e-mails have been pouring in from people who want to donate acorns they've gathered in areas where they are plentiful.
But Doug Inkley, senior scientist at the National Wildlife Federation, said that wild animals can be resilient when their usual food sources go away.
Inkley cited a blight that destroyed 3.5 billion American chestnuts from 1900-1940, wiping out a common food source for squirrels, deer, mice and wild turkeys.
"If they're hungry, they're gonna find something to eat."
