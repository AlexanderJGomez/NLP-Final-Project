It was money, power and prestige, with no one to say, "That's enough."
My office, on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, was set up like a huge living room with couches, overstuffed pillows on the floor, rock star posters lining the walls and a coffee table, the centerpiece of which was a large crystal bowl, filled at all times with a generous supply of cocaine.
With a career of impressive accomplishments in the rear-view mirror, I had what looked like only despair and death ahead of me.
Throwing in the towel and surrendering to admitting I had a serious problem should have been the obvious thing to do, given the state I was in.
Insane was the right word, all right, but it described my state of mind.
When the beautiful house I so dearly loved was finally foreclosed, it was the bank that was screwing me.
No, I didn't have to travel anywhere, except into the mirror, and by peeling the onion of my soul.
The journey was within, to at long last discover where the real problem resided.
Yes, I had long hair and a beard, the smug look of false confidence on my face and even the obligatory turquoise jewelry of that era.
After you shake your head in disbelief,and look up at me again wondering how this was possible and how I became such a different person, I will offer you an explanation.
I've been spared a life of darkness and shown a path into the light.
