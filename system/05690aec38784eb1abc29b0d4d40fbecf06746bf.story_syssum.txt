Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- After years of trying to put the past behind it, Brazil has created a truth commission to investigate crimes committed during a painful period in history known as the dirty war.
"Above all, those who lost friends and relatives and who continue suffering as if they were dying again every day deserve the truth," she said as she choked back tears.
But some Brazilians hope it could be a first step toward having that law abolished, something that has already happened in neighboring Argentina and Uruguay.
She said police brought in their children, ages 4 and 5, to pressure them.
The seven-member truth commission has been given two years to investigate human rights crimes.
The government has had to overcome outright hostility from retired military brass, and the commission is now grappling with the possibility that some of the archives may have been destroyed.
"There are some practices by state agents, like torture or summary executions, that need to be stopped," he said.
A group of young activists has started organizing protests outside the homes of former military rulers to denounce them to their neighbors and society at large.
"These people who are living the good life like nothing happened, I want to see them excluded," Herzog said.
