"Although it looks gorgeous and beautiful it is a park under pressure -- there are a lot of vulnerable species in this national park," said Tara Cameron, a local teacher and President of Blue Mountains Conservation Society.
Mark Jarvis, who runs a hotel in Katoomba, the main tourist town in the Blue Mountains, just an hour and a half from Sydney, said: "We're very concerned because the uniqueness of area revolves around the fact that we sit in between World Heritage parks.
"If there was increased interest in development, I think those investors would only do it in terms of: is it sustainable?"
She said: "Everybody is looking for how we can make national parks relevant into the future.
"I can't think of a better way to persuade somebody to be an advocate for a beautiful and wild area than going there and immersing themselves in that experience," she added.
They're the bits that we've put aside for nature -- do we really need to encroach on those as well.
