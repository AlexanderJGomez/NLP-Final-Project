The shooter, identified as 18-year-old Karl Halverson Pierson, shot one student before turning the gun on himself and taking his own life, Sheriff Grayson Robinson told reporters.
But Robinson said Friday night that an investigation concluded there was only one after it was discovered that blood on another person was from the sole victim.
Authorities descended on the school after news of the shooting broke -- on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.
Llerenas said he called 911, and he then escorted the targeted faculty member out of the school.
The faculty member "left that school in an effort to try to encourage the shooter to also leave the school."
As part of the investigation, authorities also will be looking at school surveillance video, the sheriff said.
The first sheriff's deputies and police officers arrived at Arapahoe and entered almost immediately after the shooting was reported, Robinson said.
While authorities hunted for the student gunman inside the school, students were locked in their classrooms.
She did not hear another gunshot, though the people doing the talking could have moved farther away, she said.
Dozens of students could be seen walking away from the school, with their hands in the air.
Some stood in lines at what appeared the high school track field, where they appeared to be undergoing police pat-downs.
President Barack Obama was briefed on the shooting, according to a White House official.
