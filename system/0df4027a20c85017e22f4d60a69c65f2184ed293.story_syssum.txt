(CNN) -- The death of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who was killed Thursday in his hometown of Sirte, Libya, is "an important step" for Libya, but don't expect the fighting to end right away, said CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman.
Ben Wedeman: We understood when he left Tripoli in August that he left with a large entourage, with lots of cash ... and a lot of weapons.
Wedeman:  I think perhaps his role as a leader of the anti-NTC insurgency may have been somewhat overstated.
They were actually people defending their homes, afraid that their homes would be looted, and we have seen instances where looting has been a serious problem.
So Gadhafi ... was a rallying point for a certain element of the opponents of the new regime in Libya.
There's been a lot of talk about tribal differences (in Libya) We haven't really seen that play out ... but I would not in any sense bet my bottom dollar that Libya will be smooth sailing now that Gadhafi is dead.
