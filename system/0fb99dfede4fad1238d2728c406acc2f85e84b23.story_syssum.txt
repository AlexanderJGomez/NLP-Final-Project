Eric Shanteau said he felt angry when he found out he had testicular cancer.
In June, a week before the qualifying round of the Olympics he was told he had testicular cancer.
After weeks of tests to determine the "stage" or spread of the cancer, Shanteau's team of doctors cleared him to compete in the Beijing Olympics, which meant carefully monitoring his tumor but delaying treatment.
Cancer was a motivator, he says, because he knew it meant he could be facing his last competition.
"They send me their story and it helps me to learn that people are going through the same thing I am all over the world," says Shanteau.
It is also one of the most curable if discovered early.
He adds that although he had the "greatest excuse in the world" -- an Olympic dream -- to ignore the lump, he understood the importance of early detection.
CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta was with Shanteau during the surgery and spoke with the lead surgeon, Dr. Jeff Carney, moments afterward.
Later that week, Shanteau's pathology results revealed that the operation removed the most of the cancer.
His treatment plan is to keep a close eye on his health for the next year with regular medical tests.
As for Shanteau's swimming career, he plans to compete in the 2009 World Swimming Championship in Rome, Italy.
Right now I'm just kind of taking it year by year and we'll see what happens."
