How could it happen here, in a modern country that professes to care for the vulnerable?
The report concludes that elected council officials were reluctant to talk directly to the Pakistani community about the problem and that some staff were frightened of being labeled "racist" for doing so.
It's impossible not to infer that children could have been rescued had quaint notions of "racial sensitivity" been put aside.

That is the only effective way to expose those responsible, and to shed light on the Dickensian nightmare playing out in modern Britain.
