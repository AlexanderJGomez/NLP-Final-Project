Today, the services built on top of that network have done a great job in enabling communications, perhaps none more dramatically than Twitter.
Did this mean the Web couldn't help us fulfill our most basic obligations to those in need?
There's no reason that organizations or individuals who want to use the Web to relay critical information have to rely on Twitter or Facebook or Google or any other giant of the technology industry in the first place.
When blogs took off a few years ago, wasn't it with the promise that we'd all be able to share our voices without having to ask any company for permission?
We'll naturally make great use of Twitter and Facebook and all the other services, but it'd be unforgivable to pick only one of them as a platform for civic engagement.
And that's the key lesson to learn from Twitter being down while people are depending on it for communication: Some needs are too important to put in the hands of any single company.
Now the challenge is reminding all of the social institutions, media organizations and government agencies that they need to use their own communications infrastructure just as much as they participate in services such as Twitter and Facebook.
But we don't need to ask gateways for permission to publish.
Whether due to emergency or just the everyday requirements of doing business, they ultimately will stop depending on a single point of contact for their communications.
And let's hope they won't have to worry if any one Web site goes down.
