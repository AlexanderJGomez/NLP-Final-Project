(CNN) -- Travel to Shekou, a port city in Shenzhen, and you will find the stirrings of something unexpected: entrepreneurial capitalism.
The Chinese government is investing tens of billions of dollars into science and engineering research and education, and lavishing tax breaks and subsidies on technology firms and clusters, in an effort to leapfrog the country to the cutting edge of innovation.
Politicians should remember that global innovation is not a zero-sum game: China's rise does not have to come at America's expense.
An even more dangerous prospect is a trade war, something that might happen as a result of Western governments ganging up on China at the World Trade Organization over its policies on rare Earth minerals.
That means shoring up the things that made America the world's innovation powerhouse in the first place.
America's funding for research, measured as a percent of national output, has stagnated even as the rising giants of the developing world are investing heavily.
It is wise to invest during economic recessions in those few thingsâ€”like education, smart infrastructure and researchâ€”that are the essential enablers of longer term innovation, productivity and higher economic growth.
If America wants to stay at the top, it needs to gear up on innovation.
