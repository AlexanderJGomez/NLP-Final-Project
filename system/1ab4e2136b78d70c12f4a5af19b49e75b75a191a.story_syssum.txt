Parts of the cabin bear a close resemblance to other modern Porsches -- the instruments and steering wheel are almost the same as those of the 911 and Boxster -- but all similarities end once you fire up the Carrera GT's engine.
And the best part of a decade after it went on sale, the GT's mighty 605bhp power output still makes it one of the most powerful road cars ever constructed.
It might have been hyped as a road-going racer, but I found it as easy to drive as any other Porsche.
The engine loves to rev, and working it as hard as it encourages you to unleashes neck-straining acceleration that's pretty much outside the frame of reference.
And within just a few laps on track it's possible to be pushing the car hard, reveling in the G-forces it can develop and the feedback it offers.
Most drivers will be able to drive the GT considerably quicker if they leave the system on, but turning it off does reveal another side to the car's character -- with what can be a sudden transition from the car gripping to sliding.
The higher the limits are, the bigger the risks when you overstep them, so if you do lose control, you're likely to be traveling at mind-blowing speeds.
