The investigation into what caused the deadliest disaster in Turkish mining history continues, the Natural Disaster and Emergency Coordination Directorate said.
On Friday, police in the western city used tear gas, plastic pellets and a water cannon on protesters angered by the government's response.
Abdurrahman Savas, the governer of Manisa province, where Soma is located, declined to say how many people had been detained over the protests.
Public anger has been fueled in part by Erdogan's own missteps while visiting the scene of the disaster Wednesday.
As the Prime Minister entered the crowded store, he appeared to put his arm around the neck of a man who was later identified as a miner.
Huseyin Celik, a spokesman for the ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP, dismissed the grocery store incident and said the image of the aide, Yusuf Yerkel, kicking the protester was misleading.
Among other issues, mine officials indicated Friday that workers may not have had access to an emergency refuge where they could have sheltered from the flames and choking fumes.
"This is a dynamic area," he said, adding that it is the duty of each company to ensure workers' safety needs are met.
Most have been returned to their families but DNA testing is being carried out on the remains of 13 people, the Energy Minister said.
Initial reports said the main fire was sparked by a transformer explosion, but Celik told reporters Friday that the cause of the fire was still unknown.
"Everybody knows that our Prime Minister is always with the people, and always feels the pain of the people.
Opposition politician Ozgur Ozel from the Manisa region, which includes Soma, filed a proposal in late April to investigate Turkish mines after repeated deadly accidents.
