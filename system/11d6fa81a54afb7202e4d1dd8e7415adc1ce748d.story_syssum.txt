"I'm still in touch, but I'm ready to go," he said last year at his last public appearance with the workshop, a nonprofit that recognizes Chicago reporters who take risks in covering the city.
Terkel was born in New York but moved to Chicago, where his parents ran a small hotel.
He could often be found behind a tape recorder talking to the people who would eventually become the basis for his books.
Inside the book are the stories of people between the ages of 70 and 95, a group he called "the truth tellers."
"Who lived through the Great Depression of the '30s, World War II that changed the whole psyche and map of the world, a Cold War, Joe McCarthy, Vietnam, the '60s, that's so often put down today and I think was an exhilarating and hopeful period, and, of course, the computer and technology.
"It's about life," Terkel said in 2000 when asked about the project.
It makes the value of life all the more precious."
