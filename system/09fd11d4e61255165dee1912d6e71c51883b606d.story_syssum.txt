His father, Gustav, was a loyal and patriotic German who had fought in World War I and was a decorated officer in the German army.
The Tugend's longtime nanny, a mother figure to young Thomas, was forced to leave because of a government edict prohibiting non-Jewish Germans from working in Jewish homes.
Then, Thomas' father was told he could no longer treat non-Jewish patients.
He left Germany for the United States via England with the help of old friends from an American Quaker group.
"They thought Hitler would get what he wanted and there would be no war and things would get back to normal.
And he admits his family's tragic experience was only part of the motivation.
An adventurous spirit mixed with a touch of wanderlust led him to enlist in the U.S. Army.
At the end of the war, Tugend was tasked with finding members of the Nazi party who were thought to be cooking up a post-war insurgency.
Tugend may have harbored resentment toward the people who betrayed his family and allowed the murder of 6 million Jews, but on a personal, face-to-face level, he found it difficult to hate them.
"You have to understand, the average German may have known what the Nazis were up to, but I think most of them were just trying to survive," he said.
Instead of going to the front lines, however, he was assigned to run an Army newspaper out of the Presidio in San Francisco.
After all these years, Tugend is philosophical about his family's escape from certain death at the hands of the Nazis, and his time as an infantryman at war.
