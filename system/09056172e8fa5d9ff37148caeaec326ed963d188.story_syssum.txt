"Collectively, nothing could be more important than this question of energy," Carter said during a rare presidential appearance before a congressional committee.
Congressional attention to the issue is being driven by President Obama, who, like Carter, has placed energy near the top of his domestic agenda.
Carter noted that his administration nevertheless succeeded in reducing net oil imports by 50 percent, from 8.6 to 4.3 million barrels per day.
But the panels were removed "almost instantaneously after [Ronald Reagan] moved into the White House, with assurances to the American people that such drastic action would no longer be necessary."
Richard Nixon was the first president to set a goal of energy independence, Kerry noted.
