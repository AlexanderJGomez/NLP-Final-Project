Dexter and Martin Luther King III have sued to force their sister to turn over those items, and a judge has ordered the items stored in a safe deposit box that only the court can open until the case is resolved.
In court papers, the King brothers submitted an e-mail inventory Bernice King wrote in 2007 that divided items from the estate of the civil rights leader into four categories: those she would be willing to sell, including the Spingarn Medal; items she would not be willing to sell, but might consider lending, such as the Nobel Peace Prize and Bible; items that had questions associated with them; and items she would have to examine before deciding.
But he said the center plans to display King papers sold several years ago by the estate and now owned by Morehouse College.
Bernice King has said her brothers told her on January 22 that they wanted the items so they could sell them.
This is not the first time the family has been at odds over King's legacy.
