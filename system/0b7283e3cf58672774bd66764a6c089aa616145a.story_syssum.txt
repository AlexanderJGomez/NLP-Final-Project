But what's clear is that the application, which will work hand in hand with the upcoming Windows 8 operating system, is Microsoft's play to make the Xbox 360 an indispensable tool for all kinds of entertainment.
Maybe it's the buzz about the Gorilla Glass featured on the new Samsung Galaxy S III smartphone.
Obviously, Microsoft would prefer you buy something such as the Nokia Lumia 900 or one of the many tablets expected to be released once a final version of Windows 8 is up and running later this year.
There are other products that do similar things -- from Apple's AirPlay, which streams content from an iPhone or iPad to your TV, to apps such as HBO Go that provide bonus content to enhance TV shows and movies.
Much as Nintendo's promised Wii U incorporates a handheld device with gameplay on a traditional console, players will be able to enhance gameplay on their mobile devices as well.
So, as long as you have the right hardware, there presumably will be no extra cost.
Microsoft says SmartGlass will be available this fall, which is about the same time a final version of Windows 8 has been promised.
