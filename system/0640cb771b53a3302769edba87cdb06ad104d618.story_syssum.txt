Underscoring the cultural differences between France and the United States, many French recoiled from images of Strauss-Kahn, who is charged in the alleged sexual assault of a New York hotel housekeeper, in handcuffs and in court -- photographs that would be prohibited under French law to protect the presumption of innocence.
"For 48 hours now, only the side of the accusation has been heard ... and the versions given by police have been contradictory," he said.
"That is not the case in France," where cameras are not allowed in courtrooms, the head of the Socialist Party, Martine Aubry, told reporters Tuesday in Paris.
"So we are here to say what we have always done unanimously for the last three days, to remind everyone first of all of the presumption of innocence."
"There is a real feeling that there's a rush to justice here," said Nathan King, a correspondent for France 24 television network.
Strauss-Kahn was widely considered a leading contender to be put forth as the Socialist Party's presidential candidate and face President Nicolas Sarkozy in next year's election.
"We have a tradition in France ... not to judge one way or the other until the real facts have been clearly established," Galabova said.
The Socialist Party's Aubry told reporters, "So far, we have only heard accusations from the prosecutor.
The Socialist Party, meanwhile, insisted Tuesday it will not be deterred from its efforts to win back the presidency in 2012.
When asked about it by reporters, King said Tuesday, that Mitterrand responded, "Yes, of course, but it's my private life."
"They've long put up with affairs and not reported them ... but this is criminal."
In arguing against allowing the IMF chief to go free on bond Monday, prosecutors said during his arraignment they believe Strauss-Kahn has engaged in "similar acts" at least once before.
