Moscow (CNN)Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared in a series of photos released by the Kremlin on Friday after a week in which canceled engagements led to speculation over his health.
"We are calm on this fever, and respond to the questions with patience," Peskov said.
The speculation about Putin began after a planned meeting in the Kazakh capital, Astana, between the Russian leader and the presidents of Kazakhstan and Belarus was postponed at short notice.
In the course of his many years in power, Putin has cultivated the image of a strong and vigorous leader.
