Playing in 3,775 theaters, most of which were in 3-D, "LEGO" scored an incredible $18,307 per location average, and, including overseas profits ($18.1 million from 34 territories), "The LEGO Movie" has already stacked up $87.2 million.
George Clooney's $70 million WWII pic "The Monuments Men" (CinemaScore: B+) exceeded expectations and took in an estimated $22.7 million from 3,083 locations.
It's also an all-time high opener for Clooney as a director -- "The Ides of March" opened at $10.5 million and "Leatherheads" at $12.7 million.
This places the PG-13 rated $25 million Universal pic at a $105.2 million domestic total.

In fifth place, the Zac Efron, Miles Teller, and Michael B. Jordan bromantic comedy earned about $5.54 million, for a $16.85 million domestic total.
"The Monuments Men" â€” $22.7 million
