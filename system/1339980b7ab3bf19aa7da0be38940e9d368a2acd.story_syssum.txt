The slaying of Julio Cesar Mondragon, the shooting deaths of three of his fellow students and the disappearance of 43 others in Iguala, Mexico, are sending shock waves across the nation.
According to authorities, the students, traveling in buses and a van, were attacked and fired on by Iguala police officers.
Mexican Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam says the officers were working with a criminal gang that had deep ties with local government in Iguala and the nearby town of Cocula.
Protesters have blocked roads and toll booths in cities like Chilpancingo, the capital.
Angel Aguirre, who was criticized for not acting quickly enough after the abductions, requested and was granted a leave of absence.
Neri de la Cruz, an 18-year-old student at the teachers college, says Mondragon was one of his best friends.
De la Cruz was one of the first to see the picture of Mondragon's body.
Julio Cesar Mondragon had dreams of getting a higher education, his wife says.
"My baby will now grow up without her father," Mondragon's widow says.
