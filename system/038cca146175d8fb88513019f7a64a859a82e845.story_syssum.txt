Famed for their Total Football approach, the World Cup finalists were left totally frustrated by a Danish side that was never fazed by the star-studded reputation of Bert van Marwijk's team.
Danish goalkeeper Stephan Andersen was also outstanding, notably when he thwarted Dutch substitute Klaas-Jan Huntelaar after the Schalke forward was sent clear by Wesley Sneijder's wonderful pass with the outside of his right foot.
The second half mirrored the first with the Dutch pinning the Danes in their own half, but the Danes refused to be cowed and after surviving a late handball appeal against Lars Jacobsen, Olsen's team held on to secure a memorable victory.
It was not until late in the second half that he forced Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer into a save and for the most part Germany were able to minimize the Portuguese forward's threat.
Nani then had a rising shot blocked by Holger Badstuber as Portugal finally put Germany under sustained pressure for the first time in search of an equaliser.
