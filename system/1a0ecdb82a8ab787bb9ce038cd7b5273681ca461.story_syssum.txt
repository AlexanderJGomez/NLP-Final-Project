In 1997, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration demolished seven of the mall's 11 floors after it was found that the owner obtained permission for only four.
Open to the elements, the mall's ground floor became a pond filled with years of accumulated rainwater -- and clouds of mosquitoes.
The administration hopes to determine whether New World is safe for public use by the end of July.
If the structure is deemed unsafe, the plan is to raze it and relocate its aquatic residents to a far less interesting home.
