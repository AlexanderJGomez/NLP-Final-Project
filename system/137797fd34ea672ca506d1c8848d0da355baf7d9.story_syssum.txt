(CNN) -- A shoeless Tiger Woods snored on their lawn while the golfer's wife stood silently by in the minutes after his SUV crashed into a tree, neighbors told Florida investigators.
Harris eventually noticed headlights shining toward her house from a vehicle on the lawn, so she awakened her brother, Jarius Adams.
Nordegren told investigators she used a golf iron to smash a rear window so she could unlock the door to get her husband out after the wreck.
Woods appeared to have a cut lip, but he wasn't bleeding much, Adams told the troopers.
"He was actually snoring," he said.
Woods cited the injuries as the reason for his decision not to attend his own charity golf tournament this week.
