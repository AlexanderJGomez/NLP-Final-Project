Workers walked off the job January 28 to protest the hiring of hundreds of foreign workers for a construction project at the Lindsey oil refinery in eastern England.
Local union leaders had earlier told demonstrators they were near their goal of being offered half the jobs involved in one of the latest subcontracts connected to the construction project -- 102 new jobs for a minimum of nine weeks.
Stephen Hughes, a Labour legislator in the European Parliament, warned that the reported compromise could itself run afoul of European labor law, opening the way for foreign workers who lose out to British labor to claim they were being discriminated against on the basis of nationality.
"It has never been, and never will be, the policy of Total to discriminate against British companies or British workers.
Hundreds of workers at British power plants and refineries have been walking off the job in unofficial "wildcat" strikes since the Lindsey workers put down their tools last Wednesday.
Union leaders say the strike there is only a reflection of problems with the way Britain implements European Union employment directives.
The dispute has reverberated up to the highest levels of government, with the prime minister and the leader of the opposition trading barbs about it in Parliament on Wednesday.
Brown retorted in the House of Commons.
