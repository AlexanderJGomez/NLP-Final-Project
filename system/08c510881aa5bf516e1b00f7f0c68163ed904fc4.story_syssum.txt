The tot "will be known as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge," according to Clarence House, the official residence of heirs to the throne.
Earlier Wednesday, Queen Elizabeth II went to Kensington Palace to see the newborn for the first time.
"It's the first time we've seen him really, so we're having a proper chance to catch up."
William's name was announced a few days after birth; his brother Harry's upon leaving the hospital.
It's such a special time," Catherine said.
On their way out of the hospital, the couple walked down the same steps where Diana, Princess of Wales, and Prince Charles gave the world its first look at Prince William 31 years ago.
The internal renovation work at Kensington Palace is due to be completed in the fall.
On Tuesday, London reverberated with the sound of cannon fire and peals of bells to mark the birth.
As grandmothers tend to do, she described her grandbaby as "absolutely beautiful."
Royal commentators said the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will try to give their son as regular an upbringing as possible.
But the intense media interest in the birth of the new prince highlights the challenge his parents face in trying to protect his privacy and maintain a degree of normalcy.
Although the excitement over his birth is not universal, there's no doubting the level of global interest in the prince.
His birth also took Twitter by storm.
