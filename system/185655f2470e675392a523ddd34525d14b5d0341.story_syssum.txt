(CNN) -- Less than an hour before her mastectomy was scheduled to begin, Eve Wallinga's surgeon gave her the bad news: Because of unforeseen complications, doctors wouldn't be able to reconstruct a new breast for her immediately after removing her cancerous breast as planned.
She says it gave her the time to investigate other procedures to reconstruct her breast besides the two her surgeon had recommended.
"People are typically presented with 'Here's how it's going to go,' " says Nancy Nixon, director of the Contact Center at the Breast Cancer Network of Strength, which receives more than 45,000 calls a year from people with breast cancer and their families and friends.
Other times, she thinks a doctor might fail to mention or discourage a procedure if he or she doesn't have the training to perform it.
"It gave me the extra time to seek out objective information with a clearer head," she says.
"I hear over and over again from women who are not told the whole story," she says.
The median time from breast cancer diagnosis to surgery is two weeks, according to Dr. Steven Katz, professor in the departments of medicine and health management and policy at the University of Michigan Health System.
"Many women have the reaction, 'Get this cancer out before it kills me!'
"They didn't wait for all the tests to come back, and when they did, the tests showed these women could have kept their breasts, but they had that operating room booked."
Big academic centers have them, but if your hospital doesn't, create one of your own," she advises.
