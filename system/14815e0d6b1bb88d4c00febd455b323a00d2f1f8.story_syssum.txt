Thursday, CNN learned the family trust created by Jackson to receive all of his assets includes his mother, his children and a list of charities, according to a person with direct knowledge to the contents of the trust.
Many of his fans had hoped they'd get a chance to pay last respects at Neverland Ranch, which Jackson purchased in 1987, filled with animals and amusement rides, and named after the fictional world in J.M.
"I think he was a modern-day prophet," Son said outside Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood.
"We routinely offer assistance to any agency regarding the Federal Controlled Substance Act," said Sarah Pullen of the DEA.
Speculation about the role of drugs has been swirling since Jackson died on June 25 at his rented estate in Holmby Hills.
"Based on our agreement with Los Angeles investigators, we are waiting on real information to come from viable sources like the Los Angeles medical examiner's office about the death of Michael Jackson," the statement said.
"I told him this medication is not safe," said Cherilyn Lee, a registered nurse.
The will said Jackson "intentionally omitted" his former wife and the mother of his two oldest children, Debbie Rowe.
One is John Branca, who represented Jackson from 1980 until 2006 and was hired again before the singer's death.
The men said in their filing in Los Angeles Superior Court that control of the estate would allow them to tend to Jackson's numerous outstanding debts, legal cases and business obligations.
