The guys promised not to say a thing.
It was just when you got back from tropica you made it sound like you had only smoked weed once and then last night that came out.
RS to OP: It's like I see rabbit things in your house and when we go places you take pics of them everywhere.
RS to OP: I'm not 100% sure why I'm sitting down to type you a message first but perhaps it says a lot about what's going on here.
Yesterday wasn't nice for either of us but we managed to pull through and communicate well enough to show our care for each other is greater than the drama that attacked us.
You really have dated a lot of people yet you get upset if I mention ONE funny story with a long term boyfriend.
I'm scared of you sometimes and how u snap at me and of how you will react to me.
I am the girl who let go with u even when I was scared out of my mind to.
I touch your neck to show u I care and you tell me to stop.
From the outside I think it looks like we are a struggle and maybe that's what we are.
I don't want to have anything less than amazing for you and I. I am sorry for the things I say without thinking and for taking offense to some of your actions.
Granted that it was a s**t song but you should've just lent forward and whispered in my ear to change it seeing as I had to drive to pick up your friend.
I'm sorry I wanted to go but I was hungry and upset and although you knew it, it wasn't like you came to chat to me when I left the table.
RS to OP: I like to believe that I made you proud when I attend these kind of functions with you.
I completely understood your desperation to leave and thought I would be helping you by getting to the exit before you because I can't rush on the heels I was wearing.
I'm a person too and I appreciate that you invited me out tonight and I realize that you get harassed but I am trying my best to make you happy and I feel as though you sometimes never are, no matter the effort I put in.
