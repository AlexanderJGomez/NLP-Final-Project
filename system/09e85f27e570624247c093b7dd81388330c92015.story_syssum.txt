The TV personality has been a runner-up for the past two years, but on Wednesday it was revealed that Oprah has regained her crown.
However, despite not being the highest earner on Forbes magazine's list, "her money, mixed with strong fame scores in metrics like press mentions and social networking power, pushed her to the top," said Forbes writer Dorothy Pomerantz.
Taylor Swift came in sixth place, Bon Jovi was named in seventh position, while Roger Federer and Justin Bieber came in eighth and ninth places.
Oprah is one of three celebrities who have been featured on the list every year since 1999.
