Defending champion Alberto Contador was 13th to be sixth overall, 2:27 behind Chavanel, while seven-time winner Lance Armstrong is 3:16 adrift in what is his final attempt at the race.
"I began to think of the yellow jersey on the last climb, and I told myself that after having lost, it was quite a coup to take it back again," Chavanel, who also won a crash-marred second stage, told the Tour de France website.
In the midst of it, I'll always give everything but if I lose it does not matter.
"It'll be another day where the main contenders look at each other, test themselves and we'll see if someone really wants to lay it on the line and blow it apart -- for someone like Alberto or Lance, it's probably in their interests to try and do that.
