Obama scrapped plans to attend Democratic fund-raisers in New Jersey and Connecticut on Wednesday afternoon so that he could huddle with Cabinet members and officials who are leading the administration's Ebola response.
Obama has spoken with the heads of Japan, Germany, Italy, France and England to prod them to pump more resources into combating the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.
"The administration must be able to assure Americans that we will stop the spread here at home," Boehner, an Ohio Republican, said in a statement.
Rick Perry -- lambasted by Democrats in his state for leaving on a trade mission to Europe this week -- decided to scrap the last three days of his trip and return to his state Thursday to lead the state's Ebola response in person.
Everyone working on this challenge -- from the medical professionals at the bedside to the public health officials addressing containment of the infection -- is working to end the threat posed by this disease," Perry said in a statement.
