"We find what Ahmadinejad does and says when he comes to the United Nations absolutely odious, hateful, anti-Semitic, unacceptable, which is why the United States for three consecutive years -- including today -- have led a walkout of his speech," Rice told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday.
Representatives from the United States, Britain, Spain and other nations walked out while Ahmadinejad asserted that the U.S. government either participated in the 9/11 attacks or let them happen as an excuse to wage war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The delegations that stayed for Ahmadinejad's address gave "legitimacy to a man who denies the murder of 6 million Jews," Netanyahu said, referring to the Holocaust.
He also criticized unnamed "powers" that he said were responsible for insecurity, division and moral decline across the world.
On Iraq, Ahmadinejad said the United States, whom he called "the occupiers," is "incapable of establishing security," and scores were dying daily as a result.
He said it was unfair that some nations were allowed to make nuclear fuel while others are condemned for it.
