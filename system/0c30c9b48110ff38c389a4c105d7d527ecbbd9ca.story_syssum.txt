(CNN)An Arizona prison teacher who said she was raped by an inmate is at the center of a legal controversy in which the state is accused of trying to dismiss her negligence lawsuit on the grounds of "it's a prison, this will happen," her attorney contends.
"Our office was disappointed to see a misleading opinion piece that was recently published regarding the brutal assault of a Department of Corrections employee that occurred in January 2014," a statement released by his office said.
The instructor who said she was raped was assigned to teach in a medium-security unit that houses sex offenders and special needs prisoners, including those who are mentally ill, disabled and in need of protective custody, court papers said.
Weisbard's motion also said the teacher's suit "does not even specifically allege that any of the individual defendants was responsible for assigning Plaintiff to utilize classroom 2 in the Meadows Unit," where the alleged rape occurred.
"It's shocking, it's horrific and it increases her injuries," Zwillinger told CNN about the language used by the Attorney General's Office.
This is a teacher, a civilian.
Harvey was sentenced to 30 years in March 2013 as a result of a daytime home invasion in which he "raped and savagely beat a woman in front of her young child," the teacher's lawsuit said.
She couldn't use the usual instructional space -- a visitation room with big windows for guards to observe the class -- because the prison was holding an awards ceremony in the room that day, the lawsuit said.
After the inmates finished the test, all but Harvey left the classroom unescorted and returned to their dorms, the suit said.
The instructor accused the prison and the state of negligence, false imprisonment and violation of her civil rights, court papers said.
