U.N. monitors on the ground in five Syrian cities are making "all possible efforts to stop violence" and have had "some dampening effect," Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told CNN's Christiane Amanpour.
The documented abuses "reflect this shifting context" amid widespread fears that the popular uprising against the regime of al-Assad, spurred by a tough crackdown against peaceful protests, is spiraling toward all-out civil war.
At least 40 civilians were killed across the country Thursday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said, among them "a complete family ... martyred in the shelling" of a neighborhood in Hama.
The military has conducted "large-scale" strikes on sites known for "hosting defectors and/or armed persons" escorting protests or supporting the Free Syrian Army, the anti-government resistance force, the report said.
Children have been killed or injured in attacks on protests and by snipers' gunfire, while government forces have targeted schools and used one as a command post.
"Wounded children have been unable to seek treatment due to fears of being perceived as anti-government armed groups supporters or for fear of being beaten in health facilities.
"One anti-government armed group fighter also admitted that he and his associates had killed government soldiers when the captives refused to join them," the report said.
Some anti-government groups have used children "as medical porters, messengers and cooks, for units in the field and delivery of medical supplies to field hospitals."
Some experts and officials say neither security forces nor anti-government forces may be responsible, suggesting "third" forces -- such as jihadi groups -- may be to blame.
Ban said Thursday the growing tension in Lebanon, where clashes erupted earlier this week after the killing of two anti-Assad clerics, is very troubling.
The government said the elections were all-inclusive, but opposition forces call the process a sham.
