For about a decade the Air Force has been trying to replace its fleet of KC-135 air refueling tankers, the big jets that act as flying gas stations for warplanes.
US Aerospace is a new company that is in partnership with Antonov, a state-owned Ukrainian aircraft manufacturer that used to build planes for the Soviet Union's military and now specializes in building very large aircraft.
A spokesman for US Aerospace, Chuck Arnold, said the Defence Department "still feel[s] the cold war is on" and doesn't want US Aerospace to succeed in the bid.
These deadlines count, and any professional contractor understands that," he said.
US Aerospace is fighting that decision and asking that its bid proposal, which it said will save U.S. taxpayers millions of dollars and produce a better tanker plane, be considered.
Morrell said he is confident that the dispute with US Aerospace will not slow the process again.
