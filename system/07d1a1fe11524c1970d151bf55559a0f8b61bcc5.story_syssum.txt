The superhero film began its run with a massive $125.1 million ($113.1 million over the traditional weekend, $12 million from corporate screening programs on Thursday), breaking the record for the biggest June opening weekend ever, ahead of Toy Story 3's $110.3 million bow in 2010.
The same goes for director Zack Snyder, who formerly saw gigantic numbers when 300 bowed with $70.9 million in 2007.
Man of Steel also clobbered the debut of 2006′s Superman Returns, which opened with $52.5 million and earned $200 million domestically against a $270 million budget.
Internationally, Man of Steel soared with $71.6 million in its first weekend, including $17.6 million in the United Kingdom and $9.8 million in Mexico.
In second place, This is the End opened with $20.5 million, giving the raunchy R-rated comedy $32.8 million total since its Wednesday debut.
Fourth place belonged to Fast & Furious 6, which fell 52 percent to $9.4 million in its fourth weekend.
The thriller, which earned a weak "C" CinemaScore has now earned $51.8 million and may have to settle for a finish in the $60-65 million range — a very low number considering The Purge opened with $34.1 million.
This is the End -- $20.5 million
The Purge -- $8.2 million
