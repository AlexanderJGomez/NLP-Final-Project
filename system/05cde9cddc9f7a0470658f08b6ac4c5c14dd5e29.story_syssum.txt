Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- The detained captain of a Chinese trawler was released by Japan and returned to his home country, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported, citing the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
The captain was arrested off the disputed Diaoyu Islands, in the East China Sea, after his vessel crashed into two Japanese patrol boats.
Neither country linked the captain's case with the arrest of the four Japanese nationals, however.
Japan's foreign ministry officials said Friday that China had informed them of the arrests, but they had no information about any charges or why the Japanese nationals had been detained.
The clash over territorial waters and islands -- and the natural resources that go with them -- is a flash point in the Asia-Pacific region.
China's Foreign Ministry said that Japan had "seriously damaged Sino-Japan bilateral relations" with the arrest of the captain and his crew.
