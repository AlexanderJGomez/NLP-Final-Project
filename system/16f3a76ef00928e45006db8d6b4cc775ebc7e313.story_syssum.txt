Despite reports that U.S. Forest Service spokesman Carlton Joseph said the fire burning in the Angeles National Forest was "human-caused" -- either accidentally or intentionally -- other officials insisted that the cause of the fire is under investigation, and natural sources have not been ruled out.
He said firefighters have made progress controlling the northern and western parameters of the fire, but the top priority is to keep the southeastern corner of the fire away from areas along Interstate 210, including Pasadena, Aracadia and Sierra Madre.
Residents have fled from 10,000 homes along the edges of the Angeles Forest since the fire started last Wednesday.
Noiren said two dozen Forest Service workers also were displaced by the fire, and the agency lost an entire fire station to the blaze.
"I thought that we were losing our home," the husband said of the residence where he was born and the couple raised their family.
The fire has destroyed 64 homes, three commercial properties and 49 outdoor structures since it began on August 26, authorities said.
Arnold Schwarzenegger was asked about the cost of the firefighting, given the state's precarious financial position.
He said 21 firefighters have been injured battling the Station Fire, in addition to the two killed Sunday in a vehicular crash trying to escape fast-moving flames.
While potentially beneficial higher humidity was expected, thunderstorms were possible, and they could bring the danger of dry lightning that could ignite more fires, forecasters said.
He also proclaimed a state of emergency in several other counties where fires were burning.
