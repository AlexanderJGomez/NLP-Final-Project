Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- More than 30 people have been shot dead in Nigeria, the head of Amnesty International said Friday, only a day after the rights group accused Nigerian security forces of committing serious abuses in their efforts to crack down on the militant Islamist group Boko Haram in the region.
Shetty appealed for the government to ensure the rule of law was followed by its own forces in tackling the militant groups.
Nigerian troops located in the area immediately cordoned off the area and are searching for the assailants, he said.
"At the same time, the Nigerian government has failed to adequately prevent or investigate the attacks or to bring perpetrators to justice; and victims have not received prompt and adequate reparation and remedy.
He also dismissed allegations made in the report that the military participated in extrajudicial killings of suspects or used torture during interrogations.
Amnesty International said it had shared its findings with the Nigerian authorities before it published the report, as well as requesting further information on certain cases, but that it had received no response.
Boko Haram and other Muslim groups claim the north has been starved of resources and marginalized by the government of President Goodluck Jonathan, a Christian.
