Caterpillar fungus, or as it's called in Tibetan, "yartsa gunbu," meaning "summer grass, winter worm," is a specimen created when a parasitic fungus infects caterpillars underground which, were they not forestalled by the fungus, would produce ghost moths.
The woman who has discovered the specimen uses an ice pick to prod the earth and dig a hole about six inches in diameter.
A middle man will offer her that amount, then walk it to a market in Tibet and sell it for three times the price.
Like many others, Ram and his brothers traveled for the harvest betting on hope alone.
The influx of migrant harvesters speaks volumes to the increasing global commodification of yartsa gunbu.
Thandin, who was visiting home for the harvest, remembers when the yartsa gunbu season meant local bounty, not commercial competition.
He says his family's yaks have died in recent winters due to depleted grass caused by the harvest.
Six years ago, a committee of community leaders in Dolpa instituted a taxation system on harvesters in an effort to control numbers and ensure the local community remained resilient amidst environmental changes.
A former committee member who spoke on the condition of anonymity suggests that charging admission to the harvest has only made it seem even more valuable, and as a result, drawn more harvesters.
As communities in Nepal, one of the world's poorest countries, cope with the economic need and the increasing desire for high-value commodities like yartsa gunbu, conservation efforts will require cooperation between leaders at village, district, and national levels.
