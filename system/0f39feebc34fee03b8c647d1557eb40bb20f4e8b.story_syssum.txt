(CNN)The mother of a quadriplegic man who police say was left in the woods for days cannot be extradited to face charges in Philadelphia until she completes an unspecified "treatment," Maryland police said Monday.
If she chooses not to challenge her extradition, she will be transported to Philadelphia once the treatment is complete, he said.
"The mother went to visit her boyfriend down in Maryland, over in Montgomery County, and we believe she placed the child into Cobbs Creeks Park," Walker said at a news conference.
Officials at Philadelphia's School of the Future, which the man attends, became concerned when he didn't show up for classes last week and tried to contact his mother but eventually reached an aunt, Philadelphia police said.
There was no reason for the man to suffer, Walker told philly.com, because the mother had sisters willing to take care of him.
Authorities are interested in learning more about "how this kid was cared for, and what actions were taken and providing of services by different agencies."
