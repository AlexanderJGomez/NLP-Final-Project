Joshua Lindstrom told "Anderson Cooper 360Ëš" Tuesday night that a man was acting strangely as he moved up the aisle.
Passenger Donna Tellam told CNN's "Erin Burnett OutFront" the men reacted so quickly she thought they were air marshals.
Lindstrom told Cooper he didn't hear those words but after the flight was back on the ground the man who tackled the unruly passenger mentioned it.
The man was rattling on about someone trying to bring the plane down, then become despondent and cry, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
The plane returned to Dulles around 10:40 p.m., said Kimberly Gibbs, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, which runs the northern Virginia airport.
As of late Tuesday evening, the passenger had not been arrested or charged with a crime, officials said.
Some opted to take the first flight to Colorado on Tuesday, while others chose to leave later, according to Punzenberger, the United spokesman.
