The man who lived in the home where the alleged captives were found, Ariel Castro, was charged Wednesday with four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape, Cleveland chief assistant prosecutor Victor Perez said.
Police say they went to the address once in 2000, before the alleged kidnappings, when Castro reported a fight outside his home, and in 2004, after two of the three women had disappeared.
He told her to get in the house," and then he went inside as well, Samoylicz said.
Within a week or two after they saw the naked woman, tarps went up, shielding the backyard from onlookers, Nina Samoylicz said.
News reports say another neighbor called police after seeing a woman through an attic window of the home, which Castro never allowed neighbors to enter.
While denying any tips in the past, authorities are reaching out now to try to get more information about Ariel Castro and his home, in the hopes it can help their investigation.
Some people in the neighborhood, including Charles Ramsey, the man who helped free the alleged captives, say they don't recall seeing anything suspicious at Castro's home.
Given my experience in handling criminal cases, I can't believe that we're not going to find in the days ahead or the weeks ahead much more that unravels about this that blows your mind."
