The falling debris forced the closure of the bridge and snarled traffic between Oakland and San Francisco, California, as commuters look for alternate ways to get to and from the cities.
"The bridge has been inspected, and it is now safer than when we closed it," Randell Iwasaki, the director of the California Department of Transportation, said at the time.
"Following the Minnesota bridge collapse, there was a lot of discussion because of emotions," he said.
The gusset plates -- metal plates that are meant to strengthen joists -- are believed to have failed on the I-35W bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.
"I have seen some lip service, but I have not seen a lot of momentum and action," said William Ibbs, a professor of civil engineering at UC-Berkeley.
"In the engineering community, we knew these things many years ago, and there were requests for money, which wasn't coming," Barzegar said.
"If we don't start making substantial progress in five years, we will have more collapses," Ibbs said.
The other portion of the bridge, known as the East Span, is a truss-cantilever design.
