I find Lin walking in a festering landscape of rotting food, plastic bags and junk at the Mae Sot garbage dump in Thailand near the Thai-Myanmar border.
Lin is one of about 300 refugees in the dump who survive on other people's trash.
Their daily routine follows the same pattern: They mill about the dump, waiting for the next truck to arrive, hoping for enough discarded food to get them through the day.
My assistant told me about Lin's home while he was researching another story on the border area in Myanmar, the country once known as Burma.
But he's all energy and purpose when he resumes plucking bottles from the mountain of trash.
She tells me that Lin's biological mother gave him to her in Myanmar when he was a baby because she couldn't cope with the responsibility.
Still, she says scavenging for food in the dump is actually an improvement on her previous life.
The United Nations established refugee camps in Thailand for those who flee Myanmar, but the camps are reserved only for victims of political persecution.
As a result, these refugees are trapped in the garbage dump -- not enough money to go elsewhere and no prospects back home.
Near the end of my meeting with Lin, I ask his adopted mother if she, and Lin, would ever escape the rubbish dump.
