(CNN) -- One of the telephone numbers used to report claims of abuse at a polygamist sect's Texas ranch was previously associated with a Colorado woman whom authorities have named a "person of interest," a court document says.
The charge relates to an incident in February, but the Texas Rangers have said she is a person of interest in connection with the ranch calls.
However, it has been used in other cases linked to Swinton, the document says.
Although Texas officials said they have not found the woman who made the calls, they said they have found evidence that girls as young at 13 are forced into marriages with older men at the ranch.
The phone number used in the Washington call was traced to the Colorado Springs apartment where Swinton lives, the affidavit says.
About 100 of the seized children from whom swab DNA samples had already been taken were bused Tuesday from the San Angelo Coliseum to group foster homes, the Texas Department of Health and Family Services said.
Judge Barbara Walther, who last week ordered the DNA testing of the children and ordered that they remain in state custody, signed an order this week authorizing the children's move to foster care, officials said.
Also, 23 mothers with 28 children ages 1 to 2 years will be allowed to stay in the same towns as their children.
He said the court ignored motions asking that the children be placed with their relatives.
