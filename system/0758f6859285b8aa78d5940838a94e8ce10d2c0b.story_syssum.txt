But before he appears in court for the alleged Philadelphia abduction, he made a detour to Virginia to face charges in another alleged kidnapping.
Both women were younger than the alleged kidnapper: the one in Virginia was 16, and the latest victim, Carlesha Freeland-Gaither, was 22.
Though police did not release many details of the Virginia incident, authorities say the victims didn't know the suspect.
Two days later, the suspect allegedly brought the then-naked girl into the backyard, poured bleach and gasoline on her, burned her clothes and dug a hole.
When he was briefly distracted, the girl fled into the woods.
Freeland-Gaither was abducted Sunday night after she got off a bus in Philadelphia's Germantown-Penn Knox area.
It shows Freeland-Gaither forcibly led away to a car after a brief tussle on the ground.
Philadelphia police Detective James Sloan called a witness to the abduction, Dwayne Fletcher, "a hero" for alerting police.
In Freeland-Gaither's case, the abductor left behind a string of clues.
The GPS device in the suspect's car is used to alert customers when they're behind on payments and also allows dealers to track down the vehicle and stop it, said PassTime USA CEO Stan Schwartz, the head of the company that made the unit.
Police found the car in Jessup, Maryland, where they rescued Freeland-Gaither on Wednesday night.
Members of the public and investigators are not allowed to speak with him while he's on suicide watch.
