She is serving a sentence of up to 15 years after striking a plea deal last year with state and federal prosecutors for her role in the abduction and agreeing to testify for the prosecution.
Mitchell used the revelations to explain his heavy drinking, his engaging in oral sex with Smart and his demand that she "demonstrate sexual activity" in front of Smart, said Mitchell.
Mitchell told her prior to the Smart abduction "that I needed to take seven wives into my heart and home," Barzee said, adding that the news upset her greatly.
An attempt to recruit a shoe store worker named Julie to become one of Mitchell's wives failed, she said.
Barzee, who had taken medication for mental illness prior to marrying Mitchell, said she stopped taking it when they were together at his insistence.
Barzee's testimony came after her husband was escorted from the courtroom after he began singing hymns, as he has been doing throughout the trial.
