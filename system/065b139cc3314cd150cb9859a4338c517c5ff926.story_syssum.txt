"The intent of the law is that you receive medical marijuana from a designated provider who can only help one patient at one time.
Some people are interpreting that as they provide marijuana to someone and then 15 minutes later do it again for another patient."
Market organizers said they are hopeful that a bill working its way through Washington's legislature will provide medical marijuana users and growers in the state surer legal footing to operate on.
"They literally have dispensaries on top of each other in Venice Beach and out in the valley."
