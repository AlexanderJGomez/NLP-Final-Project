Jobs first fell for extreme diets during his freshman year of college, according to Walter Isaacson's biography "Steve Jobs."
When you only eat fruit, you're excluding a lot of valuable nutrients from your diet, says Marisa Moore, registered dietician and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.
Fruit contains a lot of natural sugar, which needs to be controlled by insulin in the body, Moore says.
That puts the body into starvation mode, which can result in serious medical conditions like osteoporosis, severe dehydration and even heart failure, according to the National Eating Disorders Association.
The government recommends eating 1 to 2 cups of it a day.
