Her appointment comes amid fierce criticism against the court -- which has a heavy caseload of Africa investigations -- that it disburses justice selectively by focusing on the continent.
"Bensouda is taking over an established office with an already sizable caseload," Human Rights Watch said in a statement.
Supporters of the court applauded her appointment and said the court provides justice to victims of nations where the legal system is not efficient.
"In Syria and other strife-torn countries over the past 10 years, the ICC has come to symbolize the last, best hope for justice," said Richard Dicker, international justice director at Human Rights Watch.
