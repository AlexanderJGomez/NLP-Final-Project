(CNN) -- Sinkholes, like the kind that swallowed part of a resort near Disney World in central Florida this week, are more common than you might think.
Many sinkholes form when acidic rainwater dissolves limestone or similar rock beneath the soil, leaving a large void that collapses when it's no longer able to support the weight of what's above, whether that be an open field, a road or a house.
There do not appear to be any solid numbers, but the Florida Senate Committee on Banking and Insurance reported that insurers had received 24,671 claims for sinkhole damage in that state alone between 2006 and 2010.
For instance, in 2012, a 15-year-old girl died when her family's car fell into a Utah sinkhole, according to media accounts.
