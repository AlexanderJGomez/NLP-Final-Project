The official, who would not speak on the record because it is an ongoing case, said investigators have determined that the Piper Cherokee PA-28 had several seats removed and that a fuel drum was missing from the airport from which Andrew Joseph "Joe" Stack III took off Thursday morning.
"One may be Mr. Stack and our fear is certainly the other would be either someone who was visiting or someone who was employed in the building," he said.
City of Austin Fire Chief Rhoda Mae Kerr credited the building's fire protection, fast work by the Fire Department and the fact that the employees had practiced exiting the building in case of an emergency for the low loss of life and injuries.
"Words cannot adequately express the sorrow or the sympathy I feel for everyone affected by this unimaginable tragedy," she said in a statement read by a family friend, Rayford Walker.
Police said Sheryl Stack spent Wednesday night in an Austin-area hotel but did not say why.
"I saw it written once that the definition of insanity is repeating the same process over and over and expecting the outcome to suddenly be different," the online message says.
The online message believed to have been written by Stack mentions accountant Bill Ross, saying it had become "brutally evident that he was representing himself and not me."
Friends and former colleagues said Friday they had no inkling of the rage apparently building inside Stack.
An IRS spokesman said federal law prohibits the agency from releasing information about any interactions the agency may have had with Stack.
The IRS issued a statement Friday saying tax returns will not be delayed.
