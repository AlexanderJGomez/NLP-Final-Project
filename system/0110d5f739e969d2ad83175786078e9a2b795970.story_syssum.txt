I spent much of my time in line for the next ride of the day, the Batman roller coaster, reading about the potential for roller coaster deaths and accidents.
There's something about a roller coaster death that is uniquely terrifying in a screenplay kind of way.
"Since the safety of our guests and employees is our number one priority, the ride has been closed pending further investigation," the park said.
After Esparza's death, Sen. Ed Markey, the Democrat from Massachusetts who recently took the seat vacated by John Kerry, has reportedly renewed his call for federal oversight of roller coaster inspection.
Tracy Mehan, from the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, said that relatively little is known about the prevalence of roller coaster injuries and deaths because the federal government doesn't enforce safety inspections and investigations.
As the National Review put it this year, "Americans are 5,000 times more likely to be legally executed by their own government than to die on a roller coaster."
After looking at injuries that were treated in hospitals from 1990 to 2010, the group found that a child is hospitalized from an injury related to an amusement park, carnival, fair or arcade-type ride once every three days in the summer, Mehan said.
"We would really like to see a national database or a national system put in place so we can get a picture of what's happening," she said.
Many of those deaths could be prevented with simple changes to traffic laws and other rules, according to a fascinating report from Bloomberg Philanthropies (PDF); and self-driving cars could lead to greater reductions, still.
But the existence of more-pressing and deadlier threats does not justify lax oversight of amusement park rides that are meant to entertain.
