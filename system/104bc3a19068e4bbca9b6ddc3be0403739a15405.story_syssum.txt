The bodies were brought to the site by dump trucks, still accompanied by the remnants of what loved ones used to move them -- pieces of plywood, makeshift shrouds and in one case, an old refrigerator.
Despite the death and destruction, hundreds of people, mostly women, took to the streets in an area of the capital on Friday, singing and chanting as they marched down the street -- a sign of resilience amid huge mounds of rubble.
An 11-year-old girl rescued Thursday -- an effort CNN captured on camera throughout the day -- died later that night from her injuries after a first-aid station said it couldn't treat her severe leg wound, her family said.
A U.N. distribution center also was set up -- guarded by Bolivian U.N. peacekeeping troops -- where some 10,000 plates of cooked chicken and rice were handed out to a patient line of survivors.

The United Nations announced Friday that at least 37 of its personnel had died -- 36 with the U.N. mission and one with the World Food Programme.

The priority now, he said, is cranking up rescue and relief efforts to stave off restiveness.
