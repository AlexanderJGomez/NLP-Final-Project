This summer, as "Grease" returns to theaters in sing-a-long form (it's being billed as "the original high school musical"), and the surprisingly unstoppable "Step Up" series releases its third installment (in 3-D, no less), it's clear: Films that feature dance are bigger than ever.
Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan worked as professional dancers prior to being cast in this 2006 sleeper hit; their expert moves (and, as seen here, ultra-realistic rehearsal gear) were a big reason for the film's unexpected success.
This 1983 movie about an eighteen-year-old steel worker/aspiring dancer was responsible for the slashing of a million sweatshirts; the insouciant off-the-shoulder style worn by actress Jennifer Beals is still popular.
A much-delayed remake is scheduled to debut in 2011, but we're not sure it's possible to improve on the 1984 original -- we particularly like the scene in which small-town transplant Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon) dances his troubles away in an empty warehouse.
But Rita Moreno's spirited, twirling defense of "America" is -- much like the hot-house colors of the ladies' dresses -- nothing short of exuberant.
