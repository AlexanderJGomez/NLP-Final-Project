Syrian President Bashar al-Assad told a French magazine that "there haven't been any tangible" signs that U.S.-led airstrikes in his country have weakened ISIS, despite assertions Wednesday by America's top diplomat that "significant progress" has been made in derailing the Islamist extremist group.
These efforts haven't been coordinated with al-Assad's government, which U.S. and other Western leaders have said they want replaced -- even going as far, in some cases, as supporting and working with moderate opposition forces fighting to unseat him.
U.S. Central Command said that between Monday and Wednesday of this week, there were 14 coalition airstrikes in Syria -- all of them near Kobani, the city near the Turkish border that in recent weeks has become a key battleground in the ongoing fight -- in addition to 11 such strikes inside Iraq.
Millions more have been displaced inside Syria by the violence, with the United Nations estimating up to 1.8 million refugees in neighboring Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt.
"Regardless (of) what happens, we as Syrians will never allow our country to become a toy in Western hands," he said.
