"I, as a lawyer, didn't understand how it could go to a Department of Child and Families 51 A investigation," he told CNN, referring to the section of state law that covers such cases.
Krowski said he believes a racially motivated double standard was applied to his client, who he said turned 10 in February, and his family, which is of Puerto Rican descent.
"Then you look at a video that has brown-color skin and they're engaged in rap music and that invites an investigation."
Despite the investigation, which Krowski called "offensive," the amount of media exposure has been "a bonus" to Rivera's budding career as a rapper.
