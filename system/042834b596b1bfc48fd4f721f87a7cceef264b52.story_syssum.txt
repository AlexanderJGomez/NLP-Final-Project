(CNN) -- U.S. swimming icon Michael Phelps has confirmed to CNN that he will now retire from competition, having became the most decorated Olympian of all time with six medals at London 2012.
"Looking back, I can say I've done everything I ever wanted to," said Phelps, who won medals at three consecutive Olympics after making his debut as a 15-year-old at Sydney 2000.
On the future of men's swimming, Phelps said he is looking forward to taking a back seat and watching new rivalries like the one between Lochte and Agnel develop over the next four years.
One swimmer who has grown at the Games is China's Ye Shiwen, the 16-year-old who stunned the world when she swam the last 50m of her 400m individual medley heat quicker than Lochte in the corresponding men's race.
There are people who just jump to that conclusion sometimes, and it's not right.
