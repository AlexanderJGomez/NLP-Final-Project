(CNN) -- It's been more than a year since NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal retired from the court, and he says he doesn't miss it.
He was drawn to finding a solution after watching close family members struggle to manage the disease.
But the self-proclaimed "freak of nature" says there's always been a method to his madness.
Today, the 7-foot tall O'Neal says his current weight stays around 350, "plus 10," but admits it's not easy to stay at a healthy weight and reduce his risk of developing diabetes.
In addition to raising awareness on how to prevent diabetes through a healthy lifestyle, O'Neal says he also wants to help diabetics better manage their disease.
