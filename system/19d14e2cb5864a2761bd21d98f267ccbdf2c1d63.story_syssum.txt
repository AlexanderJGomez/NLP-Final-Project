Now past the two-thirds mark of the Obama presidency, the pair have avoided such loaded language in response to the August 9 shooting death of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown by a white police officer in suburban St. Louis.
"The eyes of the nation and the world are watching Ferguson right now," Holder said Wednesday during a visit to the community.
First came a white police officer's arrest of Gates, a prominent African-American scholar, as he tried to get into this own locked home.
Holder, meanwhile, has launched 20 investigations of police practices and alleged discriminatory enforcement patterns in the past five years, more than twice the number of such inquiries in the previous five years.
A child of the civil rights era, Holder told his own stories of racial profiling -- his car being searched during a traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike; police officers stopping him as he ran to a movie theater in Washington's tony Georgetown neighborhood.
He admonished an overzealous police response that has dispersed peaceful demonstrators, as well as looting and other protest violence that he said undermined the goal of seeking justice.
