While Bush campaigned for 2014 candidates last year, he didn't hit the early primary states like Iowa and New Hampshire, which hold the first two nominating contests and where other potential presidential contenders have already made frequent visits.
Bush only recently announced that he's "actively" exploring a presidential bid, and his team and supporters have quickly started organizing behind the scenes to form political action committees that will help him travel to meet with voters and donors as he also campaigns for non-presidential candidates.
Steve Deace, a native Iowan and conservative radio host, argued it's a mistake for Bush to skip the Iowa Freedom Summit, which is hosted by Rep. Steve King and the conservative group Citizens United.
She stressed a similar line from the announcement of the PAC, saying that he won't "cede an inch of territory" on issues or demographic groups.
