Buying your new or used car or truck through the Internet is the easiest and most hassle-free way to make the purchase.
Compare the various selling prices and find the lowest one.
• You can go to the dealership that gave you the lowest price, sign the papers and drive your new car home -- no hassles, no negotiating.
• You can shop the lowest price around to other dealerships to see if any of them are willing to beat it.
If you feel unsure or uncertain, then set it aside for a while.
It's certainly the fastest and easiest way to beat the car salesman.
The prices they offer are about the same as you would expect from an online price quote or after lengthy negotiations.
So to buy from the Fleet Department, you have to specifically ask.
When you arrive at the dealership, the Fleet Manager will show you the vehicle, allow you to test drive it, and then bring you to the office to discuss price.
Then, if you'd like, you can visit (or call) the Fleet Departments of other dealerships to compare prices.
