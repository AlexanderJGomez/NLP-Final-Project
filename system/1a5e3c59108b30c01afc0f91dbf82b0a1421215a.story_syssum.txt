For the past 26 years, musician Boujemaa Razgui, a Canadian citizen based in Boston, has traveled around the world and across the United States with his instruments, 11 neys and two kywalas, in tow.
He was told the bag would be in Boston, but when he arrived, he obtained an empty suitcase without his prized instruments inside.
While he is sad to lose the instruments and the materials, he said he would have forfeited the reeds he purchased in Morocco if it meant keeping his instruments.
Razgui's music career has taken him to Canada, Europe and the United States.
The reeds used to make his neys can only be found in Spain, Morocco and the Middle East, he said.
Now Razgui says his music career is on hold, as he has limited access to additional flutes in the United States.
"I need something to work with, it doesn't make sense to me that they were just cut off, I have a big heart for this," he said.
