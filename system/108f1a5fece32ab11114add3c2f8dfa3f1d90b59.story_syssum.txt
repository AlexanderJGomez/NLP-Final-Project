They all seem to think we need to get a smarter guy in the White House fast, and Bush is so stupid, that task shouldn't be too hard.
My alma mater is Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Greatest Show on Earth Clown College, so I'm damning with faint praise, but I'm stupider than this here stupid president.
The idea, especially from the Democrats that I know, is, we just get a smarter guy in the White House, and all the problems will go away.
He's more ambitious than I; he's going to be the next president of the United States, and I couldn't even get to week three of "Dancing with the Stars."
We need someone stupid enough to understand that the president of the United States can't solve many problems without taking away freedom and therefore shouldn't try.
I don't want anyone as president who promises to take care of me.
It's hard to find someone running for president who would be content to be what George Washington humbly called the "chief magistrate."
But the government is already big enough, powerful enough and bipartisan enough (and "bi" means exactly two and no more) that Ron and/or Bob won't even be in the debates.
But, it's not going to be easy; stupider than me is rare breed.
