At a young age, soccer taught me about leadership and sportsmanship and what it means to be a good teammate.
I have joined countless teams where I was the new girl, and I was never immune to those feelings of self-doubt.
That's why I wrote the book series, "The Kicks," to show girls the importance of maintaining confidence when faced with new (and sometimes scary!)
But I knew that I was capable of competing with them so I pushed myself outside of my comfort zone in order to be the best player I could be.
It's important that as women, we stand up for ourselves, stand up for our peers and show the power that confidence can have for women everywhere.
