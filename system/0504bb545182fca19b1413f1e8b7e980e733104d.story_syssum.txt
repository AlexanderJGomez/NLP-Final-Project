The "Jersey Shore" cast members are all expanding their empires while also giving back to the community that made them famous, via a planned one-hour fund-raiser to rebuild the actual Jersey Shore, which was devastated along with other areas on the East Coast during Hurricane Sandy.
"I think of everyone in the celebrity world, we get bullied the most," said Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi.
He doesn't think his hard-won sobriety had anything to do with the show coming to an end, but now that he's famous, he can't see himself falling back on his former career as a mortgage broker.
He's also written a comic book using his "Jersey Shore" persona as a superhero: "By day he is Mike, almost like Clark Kent, and by night, he is 'the Situation,' who has the power of persuasion with females and gets that power from a tanning bed."
Already a queen of branding, Polizzi has more deals for her own fashion and beauty lines than the rest of the cast: indoor and sunless tanning, slippers, sunglasses, perfume, jewelry and a maternity line on the way.
"My parents, they're just trying to get everything out of this moment, and they want to have a family business, so we started Team Snooki Music," she said.
I'm kind of on one of your shows, and I have an idea...'" The strategy's also in line with the network's spinoff habit, such as how "Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County" led to "The Hills" which led to "The City" which led to "Audrina" on sister network VH1.
Pauly D said -- they always have the inevitable reunion show to look forward to, because, as show creator SallyAnn Salsano said, we've never seen the real "Jersey Shore."
"What really happened in that house, no one knows," she said.
