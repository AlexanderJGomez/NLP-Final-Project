(CNN) -- While the coastal town of Savannah, Georgia, fills with spectators on Saturday for the Rock 'n' Roll marathon, Chris Fenton and Laura Devrieze will be focused on the finish line.
The program started 23 years ago when Bruce Cleland formed a group to run the New York City Marathon in honor of his daughter, a leukemia survivor.
Chris Fenton was on a business trip in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, when he got a message from the secretary.
As the second oldest of 14 children and a mother of six, Barbara received an outpouring of love after her non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis.
Fenton's left Achilles tendon is screaming at him as he talks about his mom -- now the picture of health at 78 -- from home in Kohler, Wisconsin.
"She's settling in, loves to be a grandmother and spoil the grandkids, and (is) just kind of enjoying the golden years," he says with a laugh.
He has raised close to $100,000 over the last 10 years and hopes to continue supporting blood cancer research with Team in Training.
It was from him that she learned plumbing, drywall and her way around the Home Depot store.
It was during this time that she went to her first Team in Training meeting and signed up for the Rock 'n' Roll marathon.
"It was always important for him for me to be involved and kind of have a cause," Devrieze says.
For a couple of weeks, Devrieze refused to run, clutching to the friends and family Harry had held so close.
Her dad won't be there to watch her cross the finish line.
It's mind over body, and having a greater purpose ... makes the mind part work better."
