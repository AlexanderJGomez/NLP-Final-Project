Michael Jarrett, 47, from Tottenham was among hundreds who turned out to pay their respects to Duggan and his family.
Speaking outside the church where Duggan's funeral was held, Jarrett told CNN little had changed in the decades since then.
He said politicians who blamed people who "just want to loot, steal and riot" for the unrest that broke out last month need to look at the underlying problems behind such behavior.
Yvonne Collail, 47, from Tottenham told CNN she was concerned that the recent trouble in Tottenham had made everyone less safe and meant the police would have to carry guns, which is unusual in Britain.
Initial reports that Duggan shot at police were ruled out by ballistic tests, which found that a bullet that lodged in one officer's radio was of a type issued to police.
