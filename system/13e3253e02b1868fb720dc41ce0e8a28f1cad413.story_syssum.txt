"When a big rain would come, she'd always get out and dance in the rain," the teen's mother, Auliea Hanlon, said.
This was a teen who once painted herself green "for sport" and "set booby traps," sticking wads of gum on the bathroom door handle as a child, her mother said.
One of Cherice's peers at a church counseling group broke the news to Hanlon in 2008: Cherice, then 14, had been raped by Stacey Rambold, a business teacher at Billings Senior High School.
As Rambold's case traversed the court system -- during which the teacher confessed to repeatedly raping the girl in his home, car and office in 2007 -- Hanlon came home one day to find Cherice in Hanlon's bed, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
He would recant and apologize later, but Judge G. Todd Baugh defended the sentence at the time by saying that Cherice looked older than her age and that the 14-year-old was as much in control of the situation as Rambold.
On Friday, she took a break from rehashing the rape, suicide and sentencing to look back on her daughter -- not the victim, but the older sister to John, Buck and Aulyicia who believed in unicorns and loved strawberry cheesecake, camping and making sandwiches.
Cherice gave her mom the "Cirque du Freak" vampire series, and Hanlon reciprocated by acquainting Cherice with Stephen Donaldson's "The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant."
The two shared plenty of other interests, though -- namely music.
"We'd be down in the living room -- crank it up, open the windows, open the doors and she danced," Hanlon said, recalling how she and Cherice listened to their favorite tunes.
She and her close friend, Tiffany, would stay outside in Cherice's battered tent, which leaked.
The arts, thankfully, always intrigued her, whether it manifested itself in dance or her abstract doodles.
Her daughter asked what she wanted for Christmas, and Hanlon replied that she'd like a poem.
