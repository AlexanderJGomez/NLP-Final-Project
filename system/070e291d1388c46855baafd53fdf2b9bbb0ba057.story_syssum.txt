Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Dozens of people have been killed during two days of clashes between Islamist militants and Nigerian security forces in a northeastern town, an army commander said.
That contradicted hospital and morgue workers who said the vast majority of some 50 bodies brought in since Friday were civilians.
After Boko Haram's leader was killed in police custody in 2009, its members began carrying out a campaign of sporadic violence which has been fueled by the military's iron-fisted approach, experts say.
Nigerian security forces have struggled to contain near-daily blasts in the group's home base states, Yobe and Borno.
While the violence has rarely spilled beyond the north, officials and diplomats say the group's anti-government rhetoric has earned it substantial support from local residents living amid unemployment and poverty levels up to twice the national average.
