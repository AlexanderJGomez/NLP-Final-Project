Electric shock, twisting and wrenching of detainees' genitals, stress positions including forced standing, removal of toenails and threatened sexual abuse were among other forms of torture that detainees reported.
The report comes from interviews with 379 pre-trial detainees and convicted prisoners at facilities operated by different branches of the Afghan government between October 2010 and August 2011.
"Despite their cruel and barbaric acts," terrorists are being treated "humanely and in accordance with the law," the Afghan government said, in a response included in the UNAMA report.
"UNAMA's detention observation report found compelling evidence that 125 detainees (46%) of the 273 detainees interviewed who had been in NDS detention experienced interrogation techniques at the hands of NDS officials that constituted torture," the report said.
Countries with troops in Afghanistan should suspended transfer of detainees to facilities "where credible allegations or reports of torture and ill treatment have been made pending a full assessment," the report said.
Some of these deficiencies, however, are due to a lack of experience within our staff and their lack of access to proving equipments and facilities and in part due to isolated incidents of individual violations.
