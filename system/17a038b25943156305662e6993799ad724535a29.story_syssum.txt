The case relates to an incident in the early hours of July 4, when Michael crashed his car into the front of a north London shop, damaging the facade.
He said he had taken a sleeping pill that had been prescribed eight days earlier and admitted smoking cannabis earlier in the night, Efemini said.
Michael, whose real name is Georgios Panayiotou, was sentenced for the formal charge of driving while unfit through drugs.
Michael's defense attorney said his client had "profound shame and horror" at having committed another offense.
Chawla called the singer a "kind, considerate, loyal man, constantly concerned with the plight of others."
"His creativity, so long hidden by the [drugs], is reemerging," Chawla said.
