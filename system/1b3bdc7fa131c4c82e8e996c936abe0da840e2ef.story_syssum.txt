(CNN)Noelle Velentzas, 28, couldn't understand why U.S. citizens like herself were traveling overseas to wage jihad when they could simply "make history" at home by unleashing terrorist attacks, according to a federal criminal complaint unsealed Thursday.
One day, Velentzas pulled a knife from her bra and showed Siddiqui what do with it if attacked, according to the complaint.
"She and I will address everything in court," he said.
In December, Velentzas and an undercover agent discussed the shooting deaths of two New York City police officers who were ambushed in Brooklyn.
"As alleged, the defendants in this case carefully studied how to construct an explosive device to launch an attack on the homeland," Loretta Lynch, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement.
She declared there is no "excuse to sit back and wait -- for the skies rain martyrdom."
Velentzas laughed about once having told a Home Depot employee that she was having a barbecue when she was looking for propane.
In a statement, Islamic Circle of North America said Velentzas was formerly homeless and provided shelter by the relief organization.
"She's a very friendly woman and I would never even expect that at all," Chung said when asked about the allegations.
Last month, an Army National Guard member and his cousin were arrested in Illinois and accused of conspiring to provide material support to ISIS, federal prosecutors said.
The two U.S. citizens were charged in criminal complaints filed in U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Illinois with one count each of conspiring to provide material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organization.
In February, three New York men were arrested and accused of a failed attempt to join ISIS in Syria, prosecutors said.
