"Sarah courageously stepped up after Jim was shot to prevent others from enduring what our family has gone through, and her work has saved countless lives," their statement said.
"Although we disagreed on public policy, Sarah Brady was an honorable American who we always respected," the gun rights organization said.
On the Brady Campaign's website, she said she got involved in gun control after her young son picked up what she thought was a toy gun on the seat of a friend's pickup.
Despite budgets that were just a fraction of the gun lobby's, the Bradys and their colleagues helped pass federal and state laws, including Maryland's 1988 ban on cheap handguns known as Saturday night specials, 1993's Brady law requiring background checks on certain kinds of gun purchases and a ban on manufacturing and future sales of some military-style firearms, which lasted from 1994 to 2004.
"I am certain that she would want nothing more than to know we are carrying on her and Jim's legacy with the same fiery compassion and dedication that made her so remarkable."
Suffering a head wound, it was erroneously reported at one point that Brady had died.
The Brady bill was fiercely fought over for seven years before Congress approved it and President Bill Clinton signed it into law in 1993.
