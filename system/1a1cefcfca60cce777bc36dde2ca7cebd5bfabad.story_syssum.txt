Playing his first match since losing in Monte Carlo to Roger Federer on April 19, the second seed dropped serve three times but beat the Czech 6-3 7-5.
The Swiss welcomed the second set of twins into his life on Tuesday last week after wife Mirka gave birth to Leo and Lenny, who join elder sisters Myla and Charlene.
"I spoke to the team, I spoke to Mirka, asked all of them what they thought I should do and they said too quickly that I should come here and play.
The world number four revealed that he fully expects the twins to soon be joining the rest of the family on the ATP World Tour.
"It's something I'm really going to look forward to, spending this quality time with them, as we travel the world and are in different countries and cities.
