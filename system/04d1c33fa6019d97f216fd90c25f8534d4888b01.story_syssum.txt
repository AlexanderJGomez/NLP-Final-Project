"Just put your head back and breathe," he told himself, seconds before joining the others.
Gamez was inspired to dream up his list of goals after watching MTV's "The Buried Life", a reality TV show about four friends who set out to accomplish the tasks on their joint bucket list.
Now, if you had a whole lifetime to live, would you lose that drive, or would your list just keep getting longer?"
The stars on the show -- Ben, Dave, Duncan and Jonnie -- decided "The Buried Life" summed up their concerns about getting bogged down with daily routine and losing their passion for life.
"What they do and how they do it and who they contact and help -- that's their decision," said Brent Haynes, a senior vice president at MTV, who first realized the project's potential when he saw footage of the guys sneaking into the Video Music Awards to walk the red carpet.
The loss prompted Fulton and her friends to create a bucket list made up of kind gestures, long-term goals, personal achievements and travel destinations.
For example, in the series finale, the guys help a young man who was adopted at birth find his biological father.
Like Fulton, Cheaney was inspired to write a bucket list after his friend died suddenly in a motorcycle accident last summer.
Though Cheaney hasn't yet found the time to be someone's hero, save someone's life or race Germany's legendary NÃ¼rburgring track, just writing the lists is an accomplishment, he said.
"You might think [a bucket list is] just a list of goals, but if you're really thinking about things you want to see, experience and feel before you die, then the whole concept of setting goals is totally different," Chua said.
That's why he's not ending his "buried life" with skydiving, which he said he would do again in a heartbeat, by the way.
