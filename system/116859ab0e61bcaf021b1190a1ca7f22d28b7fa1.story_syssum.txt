(CNN) -- Michael Schumacher has been one of Pirelli's biggest critics this season, but Formula One's tire supplier has backed the seven-time world champion to end his long wait for a victory at Sunday's European Grand Prix.
But Schumacher, who has won the European Grand Prix a record six times at its former homes in Jerez and Nurburgring, is confident Mercedes can overcome the reliability issues which have dogged him.
"This is a disappointment that is deeply felt by everyone in our team, and we have been working hard to ensure we understand the reasons and deal with them.
After this weekend's race in Valencia, the world championship will head to Silverstone for the British Grand Prix on July 8.
