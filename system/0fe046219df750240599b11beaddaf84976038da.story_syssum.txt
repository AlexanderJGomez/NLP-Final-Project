It's the most visited recreational forest in the country, a hub of skiing aficionados, thanks to nearby Aspen and Vail, and it's also the home of the 2012 U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree.
The Capitol Tree tours the country during the holiday season before making its way back to Washington -- and it offers visitors a chance to see a piece of the White River National Forest on the move.
During the winter season, the major attractions include skiing, snowmobiling and sledding, as well as other icy sports.
"It's amazing to see the faces of the people as they come through the gates, and they leave, and they make those Christmas memories," said Callaway Gardens spokeswoman Rachel Crumbley.
Lake Placid and the surrounding Adirondack Mountains see the majority of visitors between May and October, but that doesn't mean that the area is lacking when the weather gets colder.
The Mall of America remains a destination for any holiday shopper, if only because of its size, featuring more than 500 shops.
But this year, the mall is adding to its seasonal appeal with the unveiling of the "HGTV Holiday House," a life-size gingerbread house.
One of the village's biggest draws is the Santa Claus Main Post Office, said Sanna Kortelainen, managing director for Rovaniemi Tourism & Marketing.
The Christmas season is also the best time of year to visit, Kortelainen said.
