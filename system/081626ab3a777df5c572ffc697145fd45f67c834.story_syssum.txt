The more than three-year Syrian civil war gave ethnic Kurds an opportunity to break away from the central government and operate in semi-autonomous enclaves in the country's north, but it also meant that when the radical group ISIS threatened to overrun the strategic town of Kobani, the minority stood on its own.
The fury and spectacle of the battle on the Turkish border drew the attention of the world and brought Temir with a sleeping bag, a Canon 6D camera and some spare change to nearby refugee camps, where he immersed himself for 17 days.
"I used my camera as an instrument to hold my distance from the reality of what was happening, so I wouldn't feel 100% in the situation," Temir says.
As Turkey's Kurdish community buried more of its soldiers and struggled to feed thousands of homeless families, the smoke and flash of American warplanes bombing jihadis proved an outlet for the ethnic group's seething anger.
The fight for Kobani is just one chapter in a war the United Nations calls "the biggest humanitarian emergency of our era," but the episode features all the facets of the savage conflict that has claimed the lives of more than a 190,000 people and left an entire generation hollow.
