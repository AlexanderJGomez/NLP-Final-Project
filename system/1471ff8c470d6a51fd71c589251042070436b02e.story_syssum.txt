A man arrested in connection with the stabbing deaths had been scheduled to appear before a judge Tuesday, but that appearance was pushed to Wednesday, according to the island's solicitor general, Taco Stein.
The prosecutor's office said the suspect "heavily resisted his arrest," engaging in a confrontation that ended with both him and a police officer "wounded."
The suspect's attorney, Brenda Brooks, said she met with her client Monday at a police station in St. Maarten's capital Philipsburg, where he is being held.
The killings occurred in what is "generally considered a safe area" that is popular with tourists, according to the solicitor general.
