The problem: What this country should do with so-called DREAM'ers, undocumented young people who were brought here by their parents as children and who face the threat of deportation.
The good news is that there was bipartisan support; the last time it was put to a vote, in December 2010, a slew of Senate Democrats voted for it, but so did three Senate Republicans -- Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Richard Lugar of Indiana and Bob Bennett of Utah.
The idea was originally shared with me about five months ago by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who, along with her colleague, Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, was eager to find a way to break the stalemate over the DREAM Act and help get these young people out of legal limbo and on with their lives.
Democrats, who are salivating over the prospect of perhaps hundreds of thousands of new voters with a grudge against Republicans.
Republicans, who want to avoid the ire of these newly minted voters.
The bad news is that Democrats are afraid of Rubio, and many of them have no interest in supporting any bill that makes the rising star look good.
There are no good guys and bad guys, just both parties pushing their own interests without caring about what happens to a bunch of undocumented students.
Then both sides should go back to their respective parties and pressure their colleagues to come onboard.
Regardless of party, whether they realize it or not, they have a natural kinship.
