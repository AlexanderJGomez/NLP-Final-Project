"In the first three months, I saw such a fast improvement, now I'm worried about plateauing," said Jason Dinant.
Dinant, a Las Vegas, Nevada, resident, is one of the three iReport contributors being followed by CNNhealth as they strive to meet diet and fitness goals they set at the beginning of the year.
Dinant was invited because,  the Naked Boy News is "a very popular act," said Maurice Michaane, director of the event.
To get in shape, he works out four to five days a week, performing a combination of core exercises, dumbbell curls and pull-ups.
The key is to eat in increments, but it's difficult for people with traditional, 9-to-5 jobs to eat something every two hours to maintain their weight, he said.
"I started drinking this protein shake so I can get in all the calories and protein."
Compared with just four months ago, the "man boobies" and the extra layer of flab around his midsection have been lost, Dinant said.
While pleased with the results, Dinant worried that with two-thirds of a six-pack, his body will begin to plateau.
"It can be frustrating, especially when he is still working out and the body is not responding to the same thing.
The body is adjusting to what you're doing."
