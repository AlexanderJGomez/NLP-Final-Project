WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Officials investigating last week's crash of two Metro subway trains said a system used to detect trains in the area of the accident had failed intermittently in the days immediately before the fatal crash.
In a prepared statement, Metro General Manager John Catoe said the track circuit data problem "... is not an issue that would have been easily detectable to controllers in our operations center."
On the weekend of July 18, investigators intend to conduct tests to determine when the stopped train would have been visible from the train that struck it.
The previously reported rail-streak marks consistent with heavy braking were approximately 125 feet long, and began approximately 425 feet before impact.
