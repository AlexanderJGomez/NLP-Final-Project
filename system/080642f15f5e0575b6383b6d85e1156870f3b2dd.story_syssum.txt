Now, eight months later, her family is mourning again because they can't keep two SpongeBob Squarepants memorials at her gravesite.
Even her curtains and bathroom were decked out with the underwater fry cook's image, her mother told CNN affiliate WLWT.
But less than a day later, Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati said it was going to remove the statues.

Spring Grove said it is working with the Walkers to design a solution at the cemetery's expense "that will properly memorialize Kimberly."
