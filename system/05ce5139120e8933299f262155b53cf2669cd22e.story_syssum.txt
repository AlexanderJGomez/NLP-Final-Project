(CNN) -- "We are now locked in a rolling filibuster on every issue, which is totally gridlocking the U.S. Senate.
No recent majority leader of either party has been saved the headache of trying to lead a Senate in which minorities can exploit the rules and stymie the chamber.
But generations of Senate leaders from Henry Clay to Bill Frist have felt compelled to seek changes in Senate rules to make the chamber a more governable place.
Indeed, since 2007, Senate records show that Republicans have filibustered or threatened to filibuster more than 360 times, a historic record.
A top priority should be to eliminate filibusters of the "motion to proceed" to a bill and the three motions that are required to send a bill to conference with the House.
The change might also rein in senators' secret "holds" because the majority leader would no longer need broad support to advance a bill to the floor.
Senators would still retain the right to filibuster agreements that emerged from conference.
Coupling new cloture thresholds and notice requirements would allow the Senate to reach votes by simple majority while still protecting the minority's parliamentary rights.
Fast-tracks protect the minority's right to scrutinize presidential appointees, but ensure that nominees are guaranteed confirmation votes within a reasonable period of time.
Because changes to Senate rules can be filibustered, efforts to reform the Senate typically crash and burn.
But as this week's outrage on the Senate floor suggests, the process of an overhaul can be as explosive as the actual reform.
