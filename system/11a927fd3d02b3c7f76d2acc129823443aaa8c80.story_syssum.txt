"The male that turned himself in ... has been deemed the shooter based on the investigation thus far," said Philadelphia police Lt. John Stanford.
Detective Don Suchinsky said Saturday that a second male held for questioning was released to his mother.
They were taken to a local hospital, police said, and their wounds are not life-threatening.
Not long after the lockdown, Philadelphia police posted a message on Twitter, saying they had a suspect in custody.
On Saturday, police said school security officials provided inaccurate information about the teen who was cleared and released.
Police searched for the weapon late Friday in trash cans, along railroad tracks and other spots around a nearby major urban transit station, transit spokesman Andrew Busch said.
