Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has recently been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and website based in Brooklyn, New York.
I'd been on the Santa Clarita, California, set of "Jackass 3D" for about two hours, watching two gigantic cranes catapult a Port-O-Potty containing star Steve-O and gallons of fecal matter 10 stories in the air when the feeling struck me again.
With nothing left in their creative arsenal, they wandered out of "Avatar" one afternoon and decided that they would jump on the 3-D bandwagon to cash in one last time.
I went from having the feeling that I had one the best jobs in the world to being pretty sure the cast and crew from Jackass had it all figured out.
