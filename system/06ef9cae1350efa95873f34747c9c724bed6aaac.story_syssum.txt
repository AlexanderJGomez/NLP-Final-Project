"The wreckage has been found and there are no survivors," Kibaki said, according to the government Web site.
"Our country has lost leaders of immense potential at their prime age and with a promising future," Kibaki said.
Both Kones and Laboso belonged to the Orange Democratic Movement party (ODM), which joined Kibaki's Party of National Unity (PNU) in a coalition government earlier this year under an United Nations-brokered agreement that brought an end to the violence that ripped the nation after Kibaki's disputed re-election in late December.
The officials' deaths came a day before parliamentary by-elections in five districts in Kenya.
