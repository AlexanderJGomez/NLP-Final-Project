"February, 22, 2011... is a date permanently etched into all of our minds, a date that will go down in the history of New Zealand as one of our darkest days," Prime Minister John Key told crowds gathered for a civic memorial service in the city Wednesday.
The tremor brought down buildings in the city center in the middle of the working day, trapping workers and triggering a national state of emergency as rescuers scrambled to save lives.
The government says around 46% of residents in the red zone have accepted its offer to buy their land.

The brightly-colored containers can been seen dotted through the city, at the makeshift "Re:Start" mall in the city center and along roads below unstable cliffs considered to be at risk of landslide.

There was further damage, no one was injured, but it was a psychological blow for many people," O'Connell said.
Population figures released in October, the first numbers made public since the quake, showed more than 10,000 people had left the city in the year to June 2011.
It will be one of the more somber reminders of that day.
