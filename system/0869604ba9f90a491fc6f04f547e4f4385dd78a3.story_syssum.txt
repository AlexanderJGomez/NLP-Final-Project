Fighting between supporters of the rival candidates Cellou Dalein Diallo and Alpha Conde continued on Friday night and Saturday morning after Diallo's supporters claimed they were attacked by Conde's RPG supporters and Conde's supporters said they were sold poisoned water and yogurt at a large rally in the capital Friday afternoon.
Senior party members also said that one of its supporters was killed and another left in a coma after violence between UFDG and RPG loyalists on Thursday.
"Some members of the security forces appear to be making threats, and even carrying out assaults, based on people's ethnicity or political affiliation," the report said.
A military junta has ruled the country since taking power in a coup after the death of longtime autocrat Lansana Conte in December 2008.
