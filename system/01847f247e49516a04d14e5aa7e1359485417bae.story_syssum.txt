The patient had waited nearly six months after feeling a lump in her breast to visit the doctor.
More hospitals are creating these positions to help patients traverse an often-confusing medical system.

New to Shelton, Washington, and a single mother, Trout struggled to keep Ella's frequent doctor appointments in Seattle, about two hours from home, as well as work a full-time job as a radiologist for Mason General and juggle never-ending insurance forms.
Trout applied for the grant, and Mason General was awarded enough money to start a program.
In her role as a patient navigator, Trout does community outreach to raise awareness about the importance of breast cancer screening.
Advocates say patient-centered care can improve outcomes and reduce costs, so much so that hospital reimbursement from insurance companies is now partially tied to patients' opinions on how well a facility treated them.
Freeman then was a breast cancer surgeon in Harlem, New York, trying to figure out why patients in his hospital had a five-year survival rate of 39% when it should have been closer to 85%.
In 1990, he pioneered the first-ever patient navigation program, training people from the community to listen and answer questions after a diagnosis.
These barriers are never going to go away completely, Freeman says, but patient navigation can help address them.
Since starting the patient navigator program at Mason General, Trout has helped hundreds of women cross that finish line.
She often receives letters of thanks from patients who say she helped them feel empowered to make informed decisions in a time of chaos.
