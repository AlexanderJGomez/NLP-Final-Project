Winner: 11-year-old Sebastien De La Cruz, "El Charro de Oro" (the golden horseman) who became a national story after he sang the national anthem at Game 3 of the NBA playoff series between the San Antonio Spurs and Miami Heat and showed a lot of a talent, heart and class.
What does it mean to be an American anyway?
On the other, you have an angry mob filled with hatred and racism that, cloaked in the anonymity of Twitter, spews invective at a child.
"For those that said something bad about me, I understand it's your opinion," Sebastien told CNN.
My father and my mother told me that you should never judge people by how they look.
And the saying that I go by is never judge a book by its cover."
That means he is part of a community that has -- since Manifest Destiny, the U.S.-Mexican War and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 -- put up with more than 100 years of discrimination and mistreatment at the hands of those who consider themselves superior.
"My father was actually in the Navy for a really long time...People don't know, they just assume that I'm just Mexican.
The next chapter will be where some Mexican-Americans actually turn on De La Cruz for appearing to distance himself from Mexico.
Flanked by San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, and his wife Erica -- the boy returned to center stage and belted out an even stronger performance the second time around.
For De La Cruz, who was aware of the comments and the controversy but managed to stay above it, the call-back wasn't political but personal.
The rest of us know that the encore was about more than the boy's talent.
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.
