(CNN) -- Before two pirate leaders departed the captured yacht where they held four Americans earlier this month, a maritime source says they left instructions: Kill the hostages if we do not come back from negotiations.
However, a U.S. government official told CNN the talks with the two pirate negotiators faltered when it was determined the men "had no authority to negotiate anything."
The official took issue with a New York Times report that said the FBI's hostage negotiator aboard the USS Sterett decided the two Somalis were not serious about resolving the matter, which led U.S. officials to take the two men into custody and ask for a new representative from the pirates.
The American side continued trying to negotiate via radio with those still aboard the yacht and made an offer, and were told by the suspects aboard the Quest they would sleep on the matter before providing a reply, the U.S. official said.
The 58-foot yacht was being shadowed at the time by the military after pirates took it over off the coast of Oman on February 18.
Thirteen other pirates were captured and detained on the Quest, along with the other two already aboard the U.S. Navy ship.
As of February 15 -- the most recent statistic posted on the International Maritime Bureau's website, pirates were holding 33 vessels and 712 hostages.
