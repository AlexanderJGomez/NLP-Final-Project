The reference was to the day last year when John McCain announced that Palin, a 44-year-old mother of five who became Alaska's governor only in December 2006, would be his presidential running mate.
Before the day she joined the 2008 Republican presidential ticket, Alaskans saw Sarah Palin as a champion of ethics in government who had twice defeated oil interests, governed with Democrats in a bipartisan manner and brought down powerful members of her own party.
By the following July, Palin's approval numbers had sunk to the mid-50th percentile, the coalition on which she governed had collapsed, and most of her time was spent combating a hostile media and frivolous ethics complaints.
Not content to examine Palin's actual record, the press did its best to transform the unconventional, pragmatic politician into a fire-breathing social conservative who was outside the American mainstream.
The same McCain aides who championed Palin for vice president later turned on her and leaked damaging (and false) information to a press eager for any tidbit confirming its view that the governor was unqualified and reckless.
The Democrats in the state legislature who once had been Palin's allies turned on her.
Palin did nothing to deserve the acrimonious venom that has been flung at her non-stop since she first appeared onstage with McCain.
Partisan agendas and personal animosities have left her with few friends and many opponents in Alaska.
She can defend herself and her family against slander without the controversy distracting from the duties of high office.
Her charisma is such that she does not need to hold an office to command attention or wield influence.
Because the attention lavished on Palin's decision is further evidence of her unwitting ability to bring out deep-seated feelings of admiration -- and loathing -- in people.
We will be hearing from Palin, and from the Palin-haters, for a long while to come.
