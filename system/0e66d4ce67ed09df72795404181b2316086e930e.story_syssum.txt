(CNN) -- Hours after being released from jail, a man walked through an emergency door at San Diego International Airport, onto the tarmac and sat down on a United Express plane Tuesday, according to San Diego authorities.
After it was opened, the emergency door alarm sounded, and Bolduc said police were on site in four minutes, but by then Duncan had blended in with other passengers.
"They had us put all the bags out, they separated the bags by enough distance and had the dog go over everything," Blasgen said.
The Harbor Police chief said they will examine this incident and find out where to make security improvements.
"TSA has initiated an investigation and if necessary, will take appropriate action."
