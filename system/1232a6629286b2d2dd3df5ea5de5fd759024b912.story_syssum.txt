(CNN) -- Now that they've gotten a peek at it, publishers of books, newspapers and magazines are hoping Apple's forthcoming iPad tablet device will breathe new life into their struggling industry.
Chubb and others are hoping that the Apple's iBookstore and other pay-based models for the iPad will do for the print-media industry what iTunes did for the music industry.
It expands the universe of potential customers for us in a big way."
The idea that people might be willing to spend a dollar or so for little bits of digital content­ ­is exactly the model iTunes is based on -- and it's part of why the iPad was being hyped as revolutionary before it even launched.
In his column, Shafer quotes Pablo Boczkowski, a journalism professor at Northwestern University, to illustrate why the iPad isn't necessarily the golden answer to old media's problems.
"I'm not sure how I feel about being on the iPad and reading, because then I'm too connected," said Jacqui Cheng, a senior writer at the tech site Ars Technica, who believes her thoughts might be disrupted by the constant pings of e-mail.
Chubb noted the launch of GQ's iPhone app was widely successful in showing Conde Nast that consumers have a desire to read magazines on electronic devices.
"We are pleased to be part of the launch of this exciting new product and we look forward to further discussions with Apple," said Janet Robinson, president of The New York Times Company and Martin Nisenholtz, senior vice president of digital operations, in a joint statement.
For example, the company must decide when selling ads whether to bundle advertising for the iPad with ads for print publications.
"That's a dynamic I'm excited about."
