The lawsuits were filed Thursday in an Atlanta court on behalf of two anonymous women -- listed as Jane Doe and June Doe -- alleging they were sexually assaulted in separate incidents in 2012 and 2014 at the Georgia Tech chapter fraternity house based on a fraternity playbook for targeting women.
The leaked email contained references to using alcohol as a means of sexual persuasion and attracted the attention of online communities and social media sites.
"Misogynistic behavior is everywhere online and unfortunately, my attempt to ridicule it in an immature and outrageous satire backfired terribly and in a manner I mistakenly underestimated," he wrote in the Technique, the student newspaper.
Georgia Tech, which wasn't named as a defendant in the lawsuits, had no comment on the litigation.
