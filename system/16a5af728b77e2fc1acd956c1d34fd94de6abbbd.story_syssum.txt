The Grammy Award winner started the Common Ground Foundation to help underserved youth develop leadership and life skills.
We want them to be together and get educated on everything from health issues to just being allowed to be creative.
Common: I grew up on the South Side of Chicago with my mother and my stepfather, and I was provided a nice home, a home with love in it.
Common: I want to empower the kids because there is a lot of gang violence and there is a lot of lack of love in the neighborhoods, and that starts in the home.
We want to prepare them to be able to go out into the world and do things for themselves so they can be leaders.
My mother told me before going there: getting invited there, that is an important place to be because that is where a lot of people that do the real work are.
I have to step up more, because you see people who dedicate their lives to helping others.
But more than anything, I was grateful to be there and observe people and honor the people that were selected to be CNN Heroes, because it was well deserved and they inspired us all.
