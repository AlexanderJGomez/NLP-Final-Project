(CNN) -- One of the nightmare scenarios of the 21st century is a "rogue state" or terror group getting its hands on nuclear material that could be sufficiently enriched to make a weapon.
The informant, described by the Guardian newspaper as a local elder, added: "One container weighing 3 kg is currently located in Bukavu and another 3 kg container is located in Goma," two towns in eastern Congo.
"The men did not know if the uranium was weapon-usable fissile material, highly enriched uranium, what the percentage of uranium-235 isotope or other isotopes were, or how its content was determined."
The uranium was supposedly from Democratic Republic of Congo and was destined for Iran -- though embassy officials pointed out that the reports were unsubstantiated.
The fence is not lit at night, has no razor-wire across the top, and is not monitored by video surveillance.
"It is relatively easy for someone to break into the nuclear reactor building or the nuclear waste storage building and steal rods or nuclear waste, with no greater tool than a lock cutter."
While some progress has been made, data from the International Atomic Energy Agency show there is plenty of nuclear material on the loose.
One of the more bizarre incidents occurred in Portugal in 2008, when a man walked into the U.S. Embassy to try to help sell "uranium plates" owned by an unidentified ex-Russian general living in Portugal.
Several incidents are reported in cables from the Caucasus nations -- the most recent so far published referring to an incident last year.
In another case that is not covered by the leaked cables published so far, two Armenians pleaded guilty last month to smuggling highly enriched uranium into the nation of Georgia, hiding it in a lead-lined box on a train from the Armenian capital, Yerevan, to Tbilisi in Georgia.
