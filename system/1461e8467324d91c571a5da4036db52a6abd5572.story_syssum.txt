The ruling means that the nursing facility in which Christian Rossiter has lived since November 2008 cannot be held criminally liable for allowing the patient to die, the Supreme Court of Western Australia said.
But for people who do, it's a very important decision," said Dr. Philip Nitschke, founder and director of Exit International, a leading global voluntary euthanasia and end-of-life advocacy group.
Chief Justice Wayne Martin noted that distinction in his order, saying, "Mr. Rossiter is not a child, nor is he terminally ill, nor dying.
"Really, what we should be doing is looking after each other rather than facilitating an escape," John Barich of the Australian Family Association said in a TV interview.
The Brightwater nursing facility sought the ruling to make sure it would not be held liable if it complied with Rossiter's request to stop all nutrition and hydration, except to be given enough liquid to make it possible to take pain medication.
"I can't move," Rossiter said in a televised interview this week.
Rossiter pointed out in a recent interview with the PerthNow news outlet that he once led an active life.
Rossiter joined the Exit International right-to-death organization about three months ago, said Nitschke, who talked with him before the hearing.
"The whole organization has been most concerned for Mr. Rossiter but also concerned for our own legal standing and this has clarified things greatly," said Penny Flett, the company's chief executive.
