She had served three and a half months, not all time served, of her eight year sentence and at one point was on hunger strike.
"I couldn't understand why the government sent her to prison," he continued.
After much to-ing and fro-ing by the Iranian authorities, Ghobadi says he couldn't believe it when he found out Saberi had finally been freed, before the end of her sentence.
"Persian Cats," which chronicles the hardships facing young rock musicians as they seek to evade censorship from the authorities, had been selected to play in the Un Certain Regard slot.
He thought about leaving Iran because he felt unable to work and cites Saberi as the inspiration behind "Persian Cats," which was filmed in Tehran.
It is estimated that there are 2,000 illegal bands in Tehran, all practising and performing in a hidden world of hand-built recording studios in basements and rooftops around the city.
Now, Ghobadi says, he is planning to go to New York this week to be with Saberi, who is currently staying in Vienna with her family.
Ghobadi says he wants to start a family and get married to Saberi as soon as they can.
