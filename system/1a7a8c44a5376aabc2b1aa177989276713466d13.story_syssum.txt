Below is our cultural calendar for 2015, highlighting the most anticipated new attractions opening around the globe.
The $215 million project is the first Hello Kitty theme park outside of the cartoon's native Japan and is expected to attract up to one million visitors per year.
Backed by everyone from blues legend Buddy Guy to actor John Goodman, the $13.5 million complex will contain 16,000 square feet of interactive exhibition space, a 100-seat theater and a robust calendar of public programming.
The theme park is currently under construction just outside of the Chinese capital, on the route to the Great Wall, and will be part of Beijing Outlets World, a complex with outlet shopping, resort hotels and a conference center.
The 689,000-square-foot National Gallery will be the largest visual arts venue in Southeast Asia when it opens in the heart of Singapore's Civic District next year with a collection of regional art spanning from the 19th century to present day.
The opening is timed to coincide with Singapore's Golden Jubilee, and marks a fresh attempt by the city-state to position itself as an international hub of the arts.
- With a concourse 90 feet longer than the main concourse of Grand Central Terminal further uptown, the new wing-shaped World Trade Center Transportation Hub will serve more than 200,000 daily commuters and millions of annual visors from around the globe when completed in December 2015.
