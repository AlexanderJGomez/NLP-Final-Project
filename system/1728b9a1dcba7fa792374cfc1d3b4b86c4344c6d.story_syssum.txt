Susanne Klatten, the BMW heiress, complained to police last year that Helg Sgarbi had threatened to release pictures of them if she did not pay him nearly $60 million.
He started to ask her for money, and she paid several million at first, but when she refused to provide more he threatened to send compromising videos to her husband and the media.
At the time, her spokesman, Joerg Appelhans, told CNN that Sgarbi's goal had always been to con her.
Forbes magazine lists her as the world's 55th richest person, with a personal fortune of $13.2 billion.
