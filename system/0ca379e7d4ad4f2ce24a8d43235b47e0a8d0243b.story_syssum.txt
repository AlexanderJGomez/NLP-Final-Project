UTC, Pratt & Whitney Canada and another UTC subsidiary -- Hamilton Sundstrand Corporation -- agreed to pay more than $75 million as part of a settlement with the U.S. government because of the arms export violations and for making false statements, according to a statement from U.S. Attorney David B. Fein and other federal officials.
According to court documents, an internal e-mail from a senior manager in September 2001 suggested that officials at Pratt & Whitney Canada knew the sales could violate U.S. sanctions.
"As a supplier of controlled products and technologies to the Department of Defense and other domestic and international customers, we are committed to conducting business in full compliance with all export laws and regulations."
The United States has imposed sanctions on the sale of military technology to China since 1989, after pro-democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square were crushed in a bloody Chinese crackdown.
