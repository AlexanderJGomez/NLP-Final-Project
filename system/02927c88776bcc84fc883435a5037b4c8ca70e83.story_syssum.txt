ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Sixty-four cases of measles have been diagnosed in the United States this year, the most in seven years, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
Dr. Anne Schuchat, the director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said many of the imported cases came from European nations and Israel.
"Many people have forgot about measles in the United States," she said Schuchat at a news conference Thursday.
Fourteen patients were hospitalized but no deaths were reported.
