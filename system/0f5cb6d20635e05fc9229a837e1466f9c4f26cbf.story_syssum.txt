Boston (CNN)Jurors in the Boston Marathon bombings trial were shown a key piece of evidence Tuesday: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's writings on the inside of the boat he used as a hideout.
In the writings on the panels, some of Tsarnaev's words were struck out by bullet holes.
In his writings on the boat, Tsarnaev asked Allah to allow him to reach the highest levels of heaven.
Well at least that's how muhhammad (bullet hole) wanted it to be (for)ever," Tsarnaev wrote in the boat.
Tsarnaev attorney Miriam Conrad, who opted not to cross-examine the bombing survivors who testified during the first week of the trial, got Kimball to acknowledge that some of his information about the tweets came from other agents and that he didn't check them out for himself.
