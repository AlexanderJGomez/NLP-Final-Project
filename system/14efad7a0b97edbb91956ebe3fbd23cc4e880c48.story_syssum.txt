The couple first visited the U.S. together as newlyweds in 2005, and Camilla was confronted by hardcore Princess Diana fans with abusive placards.
Polls at the time found that between 57% and 73% of Brits opposed Charles' new wife being known as queen.
This coincides with a change in palace strategy -- away from the aggressive spin machine of the 1990s to simply allowing Camilla to be herself.
With this in mind, royal aides announced that Camilla would not use the title of Queen when Charles becomes King.
