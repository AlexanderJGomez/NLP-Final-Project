Can you tell me what Joe Cotton did?
(Each of them, by the way, was a horse, not a human being.)
Each of them did not go on to win horse racing's Triple Crown.
OK, now I will tell you the sweet and sad tale of Burgoo King, and how maybe he could have become one of the most famous racehorses of all time, a Secretariat, a Seabiscuit, a Man O' War.
He was "scratched," as they say at the track, just as I'll Have Another was turned into I've Had Enough by his keepers on the eve of today's scheduled Belmont race.
Others said he must have gotten hurt, but no one confirmed it.
In 1958, when folks were giving thought to buying one of Ford's really cool new cars, the Edsel, a lot of them were impressed by Tim Tam when he took the Kentucky Derby with a tremendous stretch run, then ran first in the Preakness, as well.
He was nothing special, a pretty decent runner in Venezuela, a long shot to say the least when he got into the 1971 Kentucky Derby and sat there in 18th place, going nowhere fast.
Secretariat came along two years later and stole his thunder, not to mention his book and movie deals.
So did a throng of 120,139, the largest crowd in history for a New York sporting event.
Silver Charm was going to do it in 1997, but he ran out of steam in the Belmont at the wire.
He could run Secretariat-style and leave everyone else gagging on his dust, as he showed at the Preakness while winning by more than 11 lengths.
"Come on," he cajoled, not liking the favorite's short odds.
He had a $20 bill that he didn't want to waste.
I said to myself, "Smarty Jones could outrun that nag with three legs."
Nor would I in 2008, when the 3-to-10 favorite Big Brown was a sure thing, can't miss, easy money.
I thought Saturday would be a great day -- an unforgettable day for an unforgettable horse.
