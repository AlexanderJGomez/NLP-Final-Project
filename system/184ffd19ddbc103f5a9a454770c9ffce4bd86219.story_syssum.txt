In his first speech since the June 12 election outcome sparked the country's worst unrest in 30 years, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the vote accurately reflected the will of the people and accused "enemies of Islam" of stoking anger.
The legal structure in this country does not allow vote-rigging," Khamenei said, in his first address since the elections.
Ahmadinejad, whose hardline policies have antagonized Western nations, claimed victory with more than 62 percent of the votes, surprising many experts who had predicted a stronger showing from main opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi.
Expressing support for Ahmadinejad, Khamenei accused rival election candidates of insulting the president in the run-up to the vote.
He called for an end to street protests, warning that perpetrators of violence would face punishment.
He spoke hours after the Iranian government agreed to meet with candidates for crisis talks to discuss complaints stemming from the election.
CNN's Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour described Khamenei's address as a heartfelt defense of Iran's establishment but said it was uncertain the opposition would heed his call to end demonstrations.
Moussavi, who called for a boycott of Khamenei's prayer sermon, was absent from the audience, which included Ahmadinejad and, next to him, parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani, who has previously had a tense relationship with the president.
However, he opened the door to corruption charges against Rafsanjani's relatives.
Iranian TV Thursday night aired confessions from people who authorities say were paid to destabilize Iran.
