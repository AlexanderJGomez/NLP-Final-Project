I thought she was too old to be referring to herself as a "girl."
And then I look at this week's Billboard chart and I see I thought wrong.
I know the perception is that only gay men care about Madonna, but if that were true, given the 114 million viewers who tuned in to watch her at halftime, maybe "don't ask, don't tell" should have been called "just assume."
The two pop icons released debut albums within two years of each other, Madonna in 1983 and Houston in 1985.
Of course, Houston was the former model with a voice for the ages, while Madonna was the thin-voiced tart rolling around on the floor of the MTV music awards in a wedding dress proclaiming that she felt like a virgin.
As for the music, her latest CD is not breaking any new ground, but it does remind everyone who owns the ground Gaga, Rihanna, Beyonce and others are walking on.
But my 15-year-old came home one day and asked who I was listening to.
The song was "Gang Bang" and I'm glad he left the room before she started singing.
