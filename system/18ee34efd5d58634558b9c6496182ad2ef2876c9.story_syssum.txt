(Health.com) -- Many people who are overweight and obese either don't realize it or are in denial -- and too few doctors are setting them straight, according to a new study in the Archives of Internal Medicine.
Obese and overweight patients who discussed the issue with doctors were also more than twice as likely to have tried to lose weight in the previous year.
A study published last year that used similar data from government surveys showed that 23% of overweight women and 48% of overweight men considered their weight to be just right.
Although it might seem obvious that excess weight is unhealthy, being reminded of this by a doctor can be an effective wake-up call, says Robert B. Baron, M.D., director of the weight management program at the University of California San Francisco.
Simple reminders and encouragement to lose weight could have a similar effect on overweight and obese patients, he says.
"If it were required or strongly suggested, it would not be very onerous.... We need to be as aggressive as we were with smoking cessation."
