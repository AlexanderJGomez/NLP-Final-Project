Low-wage workers have been the hardest hit since the onset of the financial crisis, and low-wage jobs remain a fixture of the new economy.
But there is a simple step we can take to improve the conditions of low-wage workers today.
Hourly low-income workers endure significantly greater fluctuations in their hours and less predictability in how much they earn than full-time employees.
Women and workers of color most acutely struggle with this practice.
Only 10% of Latinos and 12% of black workers reported being able to set their hours within certain limits or freely.
Traditional economic safeguards have offered little help to these workers.
Unions, for example, have provided little protection against just-in-time scheduling because of their nascent role in the service economy.
Washington ignores the problem because congressional Republicans have shown little interest in the plight of low-wage workers.
According to the National Women's Law Center, the bill would provide workers the right to request and receive predictable work schedules, receive compensation for sudden scheduling changes, and not fear retaliation if they request scheduling accommodations from their boss.
While Washington stalls, it's everyday Americans who are hurt.
It's the Arby's line cook in Fort Worth who needs reliable shifts to make her dialysis treatments.
Congress must endorse a recovery that's inclusive, livable, and one that enables every family to balance competing obligations.
