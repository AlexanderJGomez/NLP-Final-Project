(CNN) -- The World Health Organization says the current Ebola epidemic trend "shows a mixed picture" in Africa, according to a statement released early Tuesday.
With their countries facing an Ebola epidemic, the health ministers of 11 African nations have agreed to a joint strategy to try to stem its deadly advance.
The strategy was announced last week at the end of a two-day summit in Ghana that brought together ministers from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Uganda with health experts, Ebola survivors and WHO representatives.
The disease's spread "is in great extent associated with some cultural practices and traditional beliefs" that run counter to preventive health measures, he said.
He also paid tribute to those on the front lines of the fight against the deadly disease, saying health workers have been "disproportionately affected," with more than 60 cases and 32 deaths reported among their ranks.
Rugunda said Uganda, which has experience in dealing with Ebola outbreaks, most recently in 2012, had been asked by WHO to provide technical assistance in the latest battle to contain the virus.
A patient isn't contagious -- meaning they can't spread the virus to other people -- until he or she is showing symptoms.
Officials believe the wide footprint of this outbreak is partly because of the proximity between the jungle where the virus was first identified and cities such as Conakry, Guinea's capital, which has a population of 2 million and an international airport.
There is no cure for Ebola, but in theory, the disease should be easy to fight since close contact is needed to become infected, Piot said.
