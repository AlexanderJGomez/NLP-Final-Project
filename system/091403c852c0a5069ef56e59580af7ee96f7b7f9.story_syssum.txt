The cause of the blaze at the 40-story Mandarin Oriental is not known and there were no reports of injuries, according to CNN staff members who were at the scene.
"I looked and saw the huge tower full of fire, and there were hundreds of Chinese down near my apartment taking pictures," she said.
The state-run Xinhua news agency reported that more than 1,000 people in the area were evacuated, "traffic controls were imposed" on a major highway and authorities temporarily stopped subway service on a line serving the area.
It was obvious that there was a lot of debris on site -- that debris ignited very quickly," Chaytor said.
"There was a quiet concern for people that may be involved, working in the building or close to construction site," he said.
The blaze erupted in the final hours of the Chinese Lunar New Year celebration as people set off fireworks across the city.
iReporter Rice said he was watching fireworks nearby when he noticed that fireworks were being set off near the buildings.
It had been scheduled to open late last year, but the opening was postponed until this year, though most of the building had been constructed.
