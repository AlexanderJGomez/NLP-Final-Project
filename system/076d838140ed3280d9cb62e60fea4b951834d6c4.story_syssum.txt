The nasty split with ex-husband Jonathan Plummer, the inspiration for the popular novel and movie "How Stella Got Her Groove Back," was dissected everywhere, from book blogs to "The Oprah Winfrey Show."
In the book, Betty Jean, or BJ, is the matriarch of a family that includes an ailing husband, two sisters, a son in jail, a daughter on drugs and a son who is trying to forget where he came from.
And while she insists her personal life has been an inspiration for her fiction, it is not the template.
So I also figured that there was another element that would probably lend itself to the story, one I was familiar with, and that is when you open your mouth to offer unsolicited advice, and people either resent it or don't use it or don't take it.
And, when people do this, not just me, but when people offer advice, they don't look at their own behavior.
CNN: One of the stories you drew from personal experience was "How Stella Got Her Groove Back," about an older woman who falls in love with a much younger man while on vacation.
It took awhile for me to realize that, to this day, I still love the Jonathan that I loved, that I was with eight of those 10 years.
And I realized also that I had given this man too much power over my life.
CNN: Part of your appeal is having been such an authentic voice and being honest in sharing your personal life.
It wasn't even a reflection of it.
A lot of people make their own deductions about what's real and what's not real.
There are people that know what I stand for and who I am.
I don't care what kind of love it is -- it could be a baby, a puppy.
