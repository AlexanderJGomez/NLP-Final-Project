Editor's note: Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican, represents the 3rd District of Utah in Congress and is appearing in CNN.com's "Freshman Year" series, along with Rep. Jared Polis, a Democrat from Colorado.
There are constituents to meet with, letters to answer, staff to manage, media to respond to and new bills to research.
Through trial and error, Julie and I have learned some important strategies for making our family time count.
Julie Chaffetz: As I sit down for a moment to type, I'm strangely aware that 10-finger typing is much harder than thumb texting -- a symptom of my life.
Since Jason was elected to Congress, I have learned to adapt to many new challenges.
Although I'm not a perfect mother, I've got great kids who reward me with hugs, smiles, occasional pouts and late-night chats.
She recommended that when Jason is in Washington, I spend time doing the things I need to do on my own, such as errands, volunteering, time with friends, helping with homework, and home projects like learning how to repair a toilet -- and yes, I mastered this skill!
We regularly have company; so much so that we've earned the nickname "Hotel Chaffetz."
We have been laughing, counseling and spilling our guts to each other once a month for the past 16 years.
I spent the rest of my day without Jason, flew home alone, and arranged for a ride home from the airport.
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jason Chaffetz and Julie Chaffetz.
