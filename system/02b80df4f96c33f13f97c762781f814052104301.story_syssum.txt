(CNN) -- Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the man behind the kingdom's committed policy to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has stepped down from his intelligence post, according to the country's official news agency.
He became a staunch supporter of the rebel cause, supporting the Syrian Free Army in trying to topple al-Assad's government, and leveraged his close ties with his traditional friends in the West, calling on them to arm the Syrian opposition.
U.S. President Barack Obama, who visited Riyadh in March for the first time since 2009, discussed "tactical" differences with Saudi Arabia over the question of the arming of the Syrian rebels.
"I think the moderates are coming in and they are going to set the agenda for the next stage," said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, professor of political science at UAE University.
