(CNN) -- Kyle White now has two pieces of metal to wear -- one, a bracelet inscribed with the names of his six comrades killed in an ambush in Afghanistan, the other, a Medal of Honor given to him for his valor that ensured that death toll wasn't higher.
The President paid tribute to those who died that fall day in Afghanistan and those who survived.
A high school freshman when the Twin Towers fell on September 11, 2001, White joined the Army and was just 20 years old and 21 months into his military service when he faced the ultimate test.
His service had, like many other members of the military, earned him a ticket to Afghanistan as his platoon's radio telephone operator.
In an interview prior to the award ceremony, White told CNN how the group walked "down this little incline and looking into the valley, (when) I hear this single shot.
White administered first aid to one wounded soldier using the only cover available: a single tree.
White was able to drag the wounded man back to the tree.
White continued to risk himself to help his fellow warriors, again running from cover into enemy fire to reach the platoon leader.
But he would do what he was trained to do.
The soldier White had dragged to the tree earlier was hit again, this time in the knee, so the White wrapped his belt around the man's leg, creating a tourniquet.
"I remember just red hot chunks of metal like the size of my palm just flinging by your head," he told Stars and Stripes.
"I still have these images from that day burned into my head.
"And that was pretty much the reason why I decided to leave the Army."
It was unacceptable to him to continue in the service and then, perhaps, be deployed to Afghanistan.
"Without the team," he said, "there could be no Medal of Honor.
