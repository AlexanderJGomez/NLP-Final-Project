At one point in the video from the dashcam, a female officer can be heard saying: "Hold up, everybody, hold up.
Video of the April arrest shows officers stopping a vehicle being driven by Cortez Bufford, whose car roughly matched the description of one possibly involved in an area shooting.
Bufford was also ordered to exit the vehicle, but he refused and became increasingly agitated, according to the report.
An attorney representing the city and the police department defended the officers' actions in the arrest, while condemning the officer who turned off the dashcam, which is against department policy.
"The city's Police Department has a policy on the use of dash cameras and other cameras, and the Police Department special order says the cameras should be left on until the event is concluded.
He said the officer, who he identified as Kelli Swinton, remains on the job while her appeal is underway.
According to a statement from St. Louis prosecutor Jennifer M. Joyce, the "action of turning off the dash camera video diminished the evidentiary merits of the case."
