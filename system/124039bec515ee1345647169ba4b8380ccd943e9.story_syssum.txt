When I interviewed Dr. Thamer Al-Musawi, he told me his clinic is offering new hope to their patients.
About 4 months ago, they were installed on the roof of the Al-Dakhil Medical Center, where Dr. Thamer works, as part of a project being underwritten by the U.S. Military and supported by Iraq's Health Ministry.
Before we visited, someone tampered with a key circuit board and that's preventing the clinic from using electricity still being stored in the batteries.
More than anything, he simply wants to make sure his patients can get access to the best care possible.
