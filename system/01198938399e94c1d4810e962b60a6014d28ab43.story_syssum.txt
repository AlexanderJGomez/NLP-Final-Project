With the release of her new LP, "Stars Dance," the world is getting a glimpse of a more adult Gomez.
Before, I would have maybe a month or two to record an album, and I'd have to do my series at the same time and tour on the weekends.
As more former child stars are seen heading down dark and destructive paths, Gomez has always made a conscious effort to keep from falling down the same rabbit hole.
She's the one that's going to tell me 'no' when everyone around me says 'yes.'
Expectations for the disc are high, following three Top 10 debuts from her previous albums.
We want the show to be really big.
"I'm already in the studio now.
I'm super-stoked with where this is, and hopefully it will continue to just get better."
