"This was my 59-year-old brother," Haskell said of the revelation in a phone interview.
Haskell recently spoke to CNN about her own familial and emotional journey with her transgender sibling.
Haskell: First of all, I realized very soon that it's very overwhelming.
Watching her go through it and evolve -- not only was she radiantly happy, but she was completely upfront with it.
The one thing is that we are born male or female, and we need those boundaries to rub up against.
The sex we're born is not immutable, and that is very hard to grasp.
I think it's more unnerving to people when the person does just seem so normal, but I do think we have to remember that it's not that many people.
You can take hormones to change this, have surgery to change that, but you can't change the voice, the hair, the love -- there is a core of self that doesn't change.
It's hard to say the change hasn't made her happier.
Haskell: I think the reason she didn't go through with it before is because there was no acceptance.
We went to dinner at an upscale restaurant and the waiter asked how we liked our food.
I would often call her Chevey by mistake when it was just the two of us.
CNN: Ellen initially didn't want you to write the book, but then she changed her mind.
I wanted it to be her book as much as my book.
