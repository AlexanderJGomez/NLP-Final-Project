The man, described as an amateur explorer who wants to remain anonymous, unearthed a 5.5 kilogram golden nugget 60 centimeters in the ground outside Ballarat, a city about an hour and a half drive west of Melbourne.
"In the old days miners could only see or feel gold - but now with detectors they can hear it."
Shmith expects collectors may already be eyeing a potential purchase of the Ballarat nugget because of its rarity.
And he's hoping the one he found this week is a small piece and that there are bigger ones still out there."
