(CNN) -- Reputed Boston mob boss and longtime fugitive James "Whitey" Bulger is the defendant in a sensational murder and racketeering trial, but proceedings Friday in federal court had one prosecutor choking up with emotion while defending the work of another law enforcement officer.
The defense witness, John Mortorano, has admitted he killed 20 people as part of Bulger's criminal organization that ruled south Boston for decades.
Wyshak said the information was turned over to the defense in May.
The conduct of law enforcement is key in the case since prosecutors allege a corrupt FBI agent aided Bulger in his criminal actives while Bulger himself was a government informant.
But after Bulger fled impending racketeering charges, investigators found he had been an FBI informant whose handler tipped him off about the charges -- a tale that became the inspiration for the Oscar-winning 2006 drama "The Departed."
