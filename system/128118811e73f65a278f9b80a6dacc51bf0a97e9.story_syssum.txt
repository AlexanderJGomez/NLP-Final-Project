"Jacqueline became a regular model for the artist who had by this time become internationally famous," according to the auction house.
Also offered in the auction, called the "Impressionist and Modern Art Evening Sale," is "Homme Assis sur une Chaise," a Picasso portrait painted in 1956, soon after he had moved from Paris, France, to La Californie, a villa overlooking Cannes in the south of France.
"We saw a consistent demand throughout 2009, coupled with a significant drop in the levels of supply; however, during the last six months of 2009, there has been a noticeable uptake with a continuing growth in confidence from consignors."
Overall, Christie's said that four of the works offered Tuesday night went for more than 5 million pounds ($7.99 million) and 21 others topped 1 million pounds ($1.6 million).
