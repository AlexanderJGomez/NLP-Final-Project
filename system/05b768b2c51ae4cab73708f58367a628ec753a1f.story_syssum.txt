Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- The death toll from heavy floods and mudslides in Mexico increased Tuesday to 41, a government agency announced.
The remaining 11 deaths resulted from a mudslide Saturday near the small town of Temascaltepec in neighboring Mexico state.
Officials are under pressure to act quickly, he said, because another cold front with more possible rain is expected within the next few days.
Officials also built two dikes to contain the sewage but were unable to use them out of concern that they would burst under the intense pressure from the floodwaters, Luege said.
Mexico state is bordered on the west by Michoacan and adjoins Mexico City on three sides -- north, east and west.
