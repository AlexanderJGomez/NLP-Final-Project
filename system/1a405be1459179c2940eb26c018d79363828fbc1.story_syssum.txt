(CNN) -- Thousands of taxpayers across the country aren't getting their refund or stimulus checks because criminals have stolen their Social Security numbers in an identity theft scam, CNN has learned.
"Basically, their life can be taken over by just about every approach, trying to prove that they are who they are and other people are not.
And since the criminals earned income on his number and never paid taxes, he and his wife, Jennifer, can't get any tax refunds from the IRS or their government stimulus check even though he reported the theft several years ago to police and the IRS.
The Kings said the ordeal has been frustrating because they know when they file their tax return every year that they won't get the money back that they are owed.
Baucus, who led a hearing into the issue in 2008, said other taxpayers don't learn that they are victims of identity theft until years later.
He said the IRS does not prosecute, "and that's not very helpful.
The agency said it was unable to provide details of how many cases it prosecuted, however.
Once they have your personal information, as exemplified by this couple in Utah, this information could be used over and over by multiple people."
