San Francisco (CNN) -- Consumer technology giants are battling to provide the place where you store your files, and Apple is not about to be left out.
ITunes is the world's most popular jukebox software, highest-volume music retailer and already has cozy ties to the record industry.
ITunes Match will allow people to pay $25 per year to sync as many as 25,000 songs not purchased through the iTunes Store between their computers and gadgets.
For the remainder of live recordings and other obscure songs you have, the system uploads them, just like other services do, but at a fraction of the time.
Apple's iCloud provides 5 gigabytes at no charge for e-mail, documents and backup file storage.
Apple did not say how much it will cost to lease Internet hard-drive space after filling up on e-mail and such.
Amazon has e-book and app stores that provide similar syncing features as part of the package, but it doesn't offer e-mail.
Apple has integrated iCloud tightly into the mobile and computer systems it makes, starting with Mac OS X Lion and iOS 5, which debut next month and in the fall, respectively.
Apple has tried this sort of thing before with MobileMe, which cost $99 per year and was less ambitious in scale.
They're the ones that brought me to MobileMe," Jobs said, mimicking the potential response to iCloud from critics.
"If you don't think we're serious about this, you're wrong," he said, before transitioning to pictures of a massive facility Apple built in Maiden, North Carolina: "This is our third data center that we just completed.
It's rather large."
