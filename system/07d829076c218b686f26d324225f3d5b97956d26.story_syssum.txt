Fifteen former inmates and prison guards told Amnesty about their daily experiences in the camps, describing the lack of food, hard labor and cramped conditions.
According to testimony, every former inmate at one camp had witnessed a public execution, one child was held for eight months in a cube-like cell so small he couldn't move his body and an estimated 40% of inmates die from malnutrition.
One former inmate told Amnesty how he and his father were forced to witness the public execution of his mother and brother, while a former prison guard detailed how inmates would eat snakes, rats and pig feed.
Aidan Foster-Carter, Honorary Senior Research Fellow in Sociology and Modern Korea at Leeds University in England, said: "It is difficult to get hard data (on North Korea) for obvious reasons, and it could be that the numbers of people in the camps are growing.
The North Korean government -- which has denied the existence of mass political prison camps -- has not publicly commented on the report's findings.
