I wore the same pair of shoes for more than 10 years, lining the sole with a plastic bag so the water wouldn't seep into my feet.
I kept those feelings to myself and it consumed me little by little, until my heart grew cold and I wanted to give up everything.
I got so lost that I couldn't even find my way back to peace and happiness until God answered the desire of my heart.
During those moments, I discovered my responsibility to other people and I slowly developed a heart that has a desire to help and reach out to those who are being bullied and discriminated against.
Our main purpose is the exact opposite of that of the bullies and gang groups -- to care, show love and acceptance by making a small yet significant difference in school, in our family, toward our friends and the people around us, and to use our time, skills, talents, strength and energy in more productive activities.
And, even though we may feel helpless sometimes, there are a lot of things we and others can do to help stop bullying and gang violence.
The role of adults, parents and mentors makes a big difference in combating this issue.
We want to create an environment where children can express themselves in a conduct that is loving, accepting and respecting of others, so that they may grow up to be assets and not liabilities to society.
