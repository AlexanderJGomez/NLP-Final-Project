CNN announced Wednesday that it will premiere a new, "unconventional" weekend show hosted by comedian D.L.
Hughley Breaks the News," as the show is currently titled, will feature Hughley's humorous take on the week's events.
"I am very excited for the opportunity to work with the network that I have watched for a very long time, and that to a large extent, has shaped my comedic view," Hughley said in a press release.
The show will resemble the late-night talk shows of Jay Leno and David Letterman more than Jon Stewart's "Daily Show," according to Hughley.
The performer was also one of the "Original Kings of Comedy," along with Bernie Mac, Steve Harvey and Cedric the Entertainer.
