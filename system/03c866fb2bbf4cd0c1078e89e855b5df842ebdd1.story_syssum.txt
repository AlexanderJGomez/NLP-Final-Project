T.J. Jackson, the youngest son of Jackson brother Tito, revealed his suspicion while being cross examined by an AEG Live lawyer in the Michael Jackson wrongful death trial.
Their executives had no way of knowing he was giving nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol to Jackson, which the coroner ruled killed the singer, the lawyers say.
Initially it was believed that his mother, Delores Martes Jackson, who had divorced from Tito Jackson in 1993, drowned in a swimming pool, but the case was reopened, and her sons in 1995 filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against a man they accused of killing her.
If the jury concludes AEG Live has liability in Jackson's death, then they must put a dollar figure on damages -- including the emotional toll on the children caused by the loss of their father.
"Right now, I don't know if Blanket realizes what he lost," Prince said.
He's missed sharing with his father "the first day of going to school, having the first girlfriend, being able to drive," Prince testified.
My uncle would prepare him for things" by telling him about his business deals.
"I know it's making everything harder for the kids to grieve and to recover and to progress," he said.
