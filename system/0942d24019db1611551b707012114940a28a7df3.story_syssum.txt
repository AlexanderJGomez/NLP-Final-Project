Dr. West, an academic philosopher at Princeton University, has for decades spoken up for the poor.
West has simply described it as a failure, and referred to the president as "the black mascot of Wall Street oligarchs," and the "head of the American killing machine."
They ignore the positive moves Obama has made to benefit -- in real ways -- the black community, the poor, the disadvantaged, and the country as a whole.
No longer will there be kids fresh out of college starting in entry level positions walking around with no health insurance.
This legislation is not perfect -- it lacks the public option many had hoped for -- but it is the largest federal reform in a lifetime, a tremendous accomplishment.
He has done what no other president had done before by enacting the Student Aid and Financial Responsibility Act, which makes college more affordable while ending federal subsidies to private lenders and replacing them with a Direct Loan program.
Somehow, these accomplishments, which have a direct impact on the poor are not mentioned in West's and Smiley's critique.
To review, then: Putting money into community colleges, job readiness programs, putting actual checks into actual hands -- these things don't sound like the actions of someone who doesn't care about the poor and impoverished.
If they feel, like Rep. Elijah Cummings, that "people need to know that the president feels their pain," that too is understandable.
But West and Smiley have a responsibility to present a fair and complete picture, not a skewed version.
Obama said in his victory speech, "even as we celebrate tonight we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime.
