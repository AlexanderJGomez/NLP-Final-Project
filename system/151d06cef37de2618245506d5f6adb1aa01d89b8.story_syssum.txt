MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- One of two men charged with killing the crew of the Joe Cool charter fishing boat last year has agreed to plead guilty to first-degree murder, a victim's relative said.
None of the victims' bodies has been found, and authorities have said it is unlikely they will be.
Zarabozo told authorities the boat had been hijacked by pirates who fatally shot Jake and Kelly Branam and ordered the crew thrown overboard but spared the two of them.
Jeff Branam said the victims' relatives met with prosecutors a few days ago.
"If you have just one person on a jury who might feel there were pirates, they might not [convict]," he said.
Investigators and victims' family members say they were told he wanted to go back to Cuba.
Jake and Kelly Branam are survived by their children: a girl who was 2 at the time of their deaths and a boy who was 4 months old.
