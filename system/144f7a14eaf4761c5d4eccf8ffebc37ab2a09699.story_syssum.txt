(CNN) -- Vivienne Westwood is as bald as a baby, the faintest hint of downy white hair sprouting across her naked scalp.
Decades after the couple started their radical new clothes shop in an area of London called "World's End" -- displaying ripped t-shirts, rubber curtains, and even a live rat in a cage -- Westwood has become one of Britain's most prestigious fashion designers.
"It's being hidden from us because our rulers still pursue their own vested interest, they've been trained to think that the people do not understand what's good for them."
Westwood says she now plans to downsize her hugely successful clothing empire, in a bid to promote environmental sustainability.
As a teenager in the 1950s, she would alter her school uniform into fashionable pencil skirts.
The couple's south west London shop -- which at various times was named "Let it Rock," "Sex," and "Seditionaries - Clothes for Heroes" -- sold everything from rubber fetish gear to pirate outfits.
Cast your eye across the most glamorous red carpet events in the world today and you'll likely to see a Westwood design -- be it Lily Allen's princess dress at the BAFTAs or Pharrell Williams' cowboy hat at the Oscars.
