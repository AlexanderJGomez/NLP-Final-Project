Shulman explained that the IRS had sent out information packages to 20.5 million recipients of Social Security or veterans benefits who did not file 2006 tax returns to explain how to claim their payments.
In all, the IRS has sent out more than 76 million stimulus checks, in amounts up to $600 for individuals, $1,200 for married couples and $300 per child for families.
Olson also blamed the lack of participation of more than 5 million seniors and veterans on their lack of access to and experience with computers and the Internet, as well as a belief by some that the filing process is too cumbersome and complicated.
The notices sent to those who didn't file an income tax return in 2006 told them they should file a 1040A tax form for 2007 even if they had no tax liability.
