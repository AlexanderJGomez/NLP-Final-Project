Of the six universities where I have worked, the University of Virginia stands out among them for not only the frequency of rape allegations but also for the unresponsiveness of administrators.
To an outsider this might seem like an admirable first step.
Suspending fraternities' functions at this point essentially means that they are not able to have official parties during the week between Thanksgiving and final exams.
When I worked there, I was once asked to meet with a student who had been found responsible for sexual assault.
During my tenure there, rape survivors would commonly tell me that they had wanted to file charges against their attacker but were told by administrators that their cases were more fit for mediation.
Let's remember that while recent news makes the University of Virginia seems more egregious than most institutions, a lot of students there are making a big difference -- men in the One in Four chapter and women in the One Less organization.
It is time to use research-based programs like The Men's Program, The Women's Program, Green Dot, MVP and Bringing in the Bystander to eradicate this problem.
