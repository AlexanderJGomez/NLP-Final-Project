'"All in the Family' star Jean Stapleton dies at 90.
RIP Jean Stapleton.
"Jean Stapleton was a great actress and a wonderful lady.
"All In The Family was a great show, acting may have been best in sitcom history.
"Ms. Stapleton was a spectacular actress but her role with Mr. Lear behind the scenes was as funny and authentic as any in TV history.
"Jean was a brilliant comedienne with exquisite timing.
"I was at my computer when her glorious children, John and Pam, phoned me, and I told them I was working on my memoir, and reflecting on the time I was father to my personal family on Mooncrest Drive while also fathering Archie and Edith and three other families on CBS.
