The program aims to stop polluted rainwater in the city's alleyways from ending up in adjacent Lake Michigan.
"We wanted to come up with a different way of solving that problem other than reconstructing, putting in a sewer system and adding water to our already full sewer system," said Janet Attarian, sustainability coordinator with the Chicago Department of Transportation.
That's a big deal, Attarian explained, because the city takes about a billion gallons of water out of Lake Michigan every year.
Additionally, green alleys feature pavement that's high in albedo, or the ability to reflect light.
Other features of the Green Alley program include the use of recycled materials in pavement and energy-efficient light fixtures that direct light downward to reduce light pollution.
