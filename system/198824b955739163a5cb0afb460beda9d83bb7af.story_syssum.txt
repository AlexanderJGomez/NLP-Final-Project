(CNN) -- At least one corner of the solar system may be serving up an ice-and-water sandwich, with the possibility of life on the rocks.
When we added salts to our models, we came up with liquids dense enough to sink to the sea floor."
Vance and colleagues did not visit Ganymede, obviously, but they performed laboratory experiments here on Earth to simulate what would happen to ice and salty water on the Jupiter moon.
They showed that the density of liquids goes up with the presence of salt under extreme conditions inside moons such as Ganymede.
Computer models taking all of that into account suggest that Ganymede has as many as three ice layers with liquid ocean between them.
Senior author Christophe Sotin, also of NASA's JPL, said in a statement that the "sandwich" model reflects a stable state, but there are various reasons why the moon might not achieve this structure; it may even alternate between a "club sandwich" phase and a structure with fewer layers: light ice, ocean, high-pressure ice.
We may learn more about Ganymede and other moons with the potential of life through a space mission called Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, or JUICE.
