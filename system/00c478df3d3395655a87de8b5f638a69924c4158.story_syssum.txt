So she was shocked to see the body of a tall brunette woman lying in the open casket at her mother's wake in New Jersey on December 9.
Other than a pacemaker and a right hip replacement, Kondvar said, her mother was in good health and very active.
Kondvar said her family was told their mother's body had been taken to Emerald Funeral Home in St. Maarten, where the funeral director denied their request to see their mother and demanded a $7,000 wire-transfer-only fee to send the body back to the United States.
The casket also had a small, red-velvet pouch containing jewelry and items that Kondvar said did not belong to her mother.
"It pains me that she's gone, and it's even worse because I don't have her and I want to hold her one more time, and I can't do that," Kondvar said.
Kondvar said she hasn't heard from the hospital or the funeral home since leaving St. Maarten.
As if the situation weren't already complicated, there's reason to believe that somehow her mother's body was mistakenly sent to a family in Canada and cremated, Kondvar told CNN.
"Upon collection of the deceased the next of kin of both deceased persons claimed that this was not the body of their respective relatives and have lodged a complaint with the local law enforcement authorities.
The body that was flown to Canada has since been cremated," the government website said.
She's been in touch with the State Department and wants to hire an international attorney to lead her own investigation.
Kondvar, a resident of Warwick, said she's not sure whether she will ever return to St. Maarten, although she has fond memories of the island and the residents from her family vacations.
