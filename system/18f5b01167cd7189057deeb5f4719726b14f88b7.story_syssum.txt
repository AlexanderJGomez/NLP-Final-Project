"Oh, my God," Hayes said as Asiana Airlines Flight 214 tore into the tarmac and skidded across the ground.
The crash-landing left two dead and hurt 182 people, six of whom were in critical condition Sunday.
"When I caught the plane coming into view, everything looked fine at first until I kind of fixed my gaze on him, and I seen his nose up in the air," Hayes said.
The Boeing 777 appeared "maybe a little lower than some of the other planes" as it approached, "but I couldn't say that for sure," he told CNN's Don Lemon.
"If that had happened -- my goodness, this would be a completely different kind of report to make today," he said.
"The only thing we can say is we're just really happy that a lot of people survived, because it wasn't looking good for them folks on that plane for sure," Hayes said.
