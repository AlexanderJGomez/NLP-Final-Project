Now imagine a kajillion operators doing that at the same time.
Explain exactly what you want out of an e-mail correspondence ("to tell you about my small business" or "to see if you'd be open to a brief informational interview" makes a lot more sense than "to network with you") and add a little flattery to sweeten the deal (i.e., why you found the target worth e-mailing).
Should it go unanswered, you can just blame his or her overtaxed inbox.
If you're confident that everyone involved will be happy with the connection, though, you can just go ahead and put them both on a "Bleeding Heart, meet Has-Been" type e-mail and then slip graciously into the background as they have their conversation.
After your benevolent contact has made the intro, take him off the reply-all chain (so he isn't trapped in the e-mail crossfire as you two discuss the cupcakes-for-kitten-spaying fundraiser you're planning), and separately write to her to say thanks.
If that person can't help, just go back to the drawing board -- the one with a kajillion operators connecting humans at dizzying rates.
