"A helicopter touched down briefly in the courtyard before taking off with the three prisoners,"  said Ann Mathieu, a spokeswoman for Quebec Provincial Police.
It marks the second brazen jail escape in Canada in a little more than a year.
In March 2013, two men posing as tourists commandeered a helicopter from a Canadian tour company, ordered the pilot to fly over a detention center near Montreal, hoisted two inmates into the hovering aircraft using cables -- and zipped away.
Last year, another prison escape in Greece tried to use the same tactic.
And in France, Pascal Payet escaped not once, not twice, but three times from French prisons.
