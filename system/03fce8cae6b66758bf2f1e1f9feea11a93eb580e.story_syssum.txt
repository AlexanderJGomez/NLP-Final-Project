That's clearly the idea behind "Fun Size," which tells the story of a smart and responsible high-school senior (Nickelodeon's Victoria Justice) whose All Hallow's Eve turns into a disastrous adventure in babysitting.
You'd hope that "Gossip Girl" creator Josh Schwartz, directing for the first time, would have a better feel for such matter, but "Fun Size" blatantly and lazily traces mediocre versions of the genre.
There remains a huge market for a great Halloween teen comedy, but "Fun Size" is the disappointing apple that your crazy-haired neighbor gives you instead of candy.
