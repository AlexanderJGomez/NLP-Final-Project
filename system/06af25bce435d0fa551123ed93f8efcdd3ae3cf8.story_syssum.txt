"Gigi Jordan showed no mercy to her son, and should receive none at the time of her sentencing," Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said in a statement.
Prosecutors said Jordan, who testified that she killed the boy to prevent him from being sexually abused, forced many of the drugs down his throat with a syringe.
"Any time someone is convicted of a crime, particularly of the crime of having caused the death of a young child, there's nothing to revel in.
When police arrived at the hotel, they found Jordan sitting next to the bed where her son lay unresponsive, surrounded by pills and pill bottles.
Prosecutor Matt Bogdanos presented expert testimony that showed the boy's injuries were consistent with Jordan climbing on top of Jude and holding open his mouth as she poured the lethal cocktail.
"I made the decision I was going to end my life and Jude's life," she told the jury, placing her hand over her mouth.
While on the stand, Jordan at first appeared calm as she described for a jury the last time she saw her son alive.
We were saying goodbye to each other," Jordan told the jury and then began to cry.
"A lot more of the Ambien," she said.
Some witnesses described how Jordan held the device in one hand while supporting and possibly guiding her son's arm with the other as Jude looked away.
Jordan told the jury she planned on giving the money to charity before taking her life.
