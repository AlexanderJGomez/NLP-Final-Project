(CNN)In his writings, author Avijit Roy yearned for reason and humanism guided by science.
As usual, Roy defied the threats and departed his home in suburban Atlanta for Dhaka, where he appeared at a speaking engagement about his latest books -- one of them titled "The Virus of Faith."
No one came to their aid as they were hacked down, a witness said.
Roy founded the religion critical blog Mukto Mona, which served multiple writers.
You were a voice to so many voiceless," a fan wrote after his death.
He began one of his final articles by writing that January's Charlie Hebdo massacre in France was "a tragic atrocity committed by soldiers of the so-called religion of peace."
And it is still a major headline news in this century," he recently tweeted.
He was a science geek who admired Charles Darwin, evolutionary psychology and astrophysics, according to a Facebook account in his name.
He regularly attended a February book fair in the Bangladeshi capital, and last year, after he launched "The Virus of Faith," the death threats began streaming in.
"A well-known extremist ... openly issued death threats to me through his numerous Facebook statuses," Roy wrote.
But he will be murdered when he comes back," the Islamist wrote, according to Roy.
