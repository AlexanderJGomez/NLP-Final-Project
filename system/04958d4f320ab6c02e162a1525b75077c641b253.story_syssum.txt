A security firm that had pointed the finger at a 17-year-old Russian last week updated its report Monday to identify a different Russian resident as being responsible for writing the malware used in an attack compromised the credit card numbers and other personal information of up to 110 million Target customers.
One of the things the hackers do is take the malware as it's called.
The first sample of the malware was created in March and since then, more than 40 versions have been sold around the world, IntelCrawler said.
Andrew Komarov, IntelCrawler CEO, said most of the victims are department stores and said more BlackPOS infections as well as new breaches could appear soon.
All 40 million may have been damaged in some way, and under law they can all be joined together in a class action lawsuit."
