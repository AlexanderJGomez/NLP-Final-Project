It was a typical African rural scene, but with a difference: traditionally the driver would have been a white Afrikaans male farmer, but Bohitile is a black woman.

When there is progress and you are moving forward you will need to keep up with skills development."
There remains a strong sense of shared identity among Namibians of all races, and a common belief that their future can be better.
