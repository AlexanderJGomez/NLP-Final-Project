Vice President Joe Biden emphasized the issue of income inequality to a gathering of major donors and activists Friday night, telling them Democrats will work to address it to help working people, an attendee at the event told CNN.
The party had a good message ahead of the most recent election, which ended with Democrats losing seats in the House and losing control of the Senate, but its leaders didn't speak loudly enough to push it, Biden said, according to the source.
He also got some laughs and applause recounting how he told then-Sen. Barack Obama -- when he accepted his offer to be his running mate in 2008 -- that he would not change his brand, a seeming reference to his reputation for outspokenness and occasional verbal missteps.
Nor did he mention the hot-button issue of immigration reform, even as the Obama administration prepares executive action to prevent the deportation of millions of illegal immigrants.
