But on the flip side, some of the worst of aspects of human behavior are on show for all to see and then subjected to immense media scrutiny to highlight the fallibility of our sporting icons.
Zinedine Zidane: Midfield supremo Zidane features at the very top of our football heroes of the decade but he also heads the list of villains for his infamous headbutt on Italy's Marco Materazzi in extra time of the 2006 World Cup final.
Thierry Henry:  Henry went into France's World Cup qualifying playoff against Ireland as one of the most respected footballers on the planet but by the end of the tie his reputation was in tatters.
Henry's reputation has been tainted and he can expect a less-than-warm reception at South Africa 2010.
Rivaldo's play acting was rightly condemned and forever replayed as the worst example of its kind.
The outspoken Irishman, who even walked out on his country's 2002 World Cup bid, later admitted he had deliberately "hurt" Haaland in revenge for an earlier incident.
Two legal appeals, with another in the pipeline, have so far failed, leaving Mutu heavily out of pocket for a few moments of indiscretion.
Hoyzer was jailed for over two years and his revelations left a stain on Bundesliga football.
He received a six-month ban from the AFC Champions League for spitting at a match official and during the 2006 World Cup his tackle left France's Djibril Cisse with a broken leg.
He is good friends with the final member of our XI, Diego Maradona.
