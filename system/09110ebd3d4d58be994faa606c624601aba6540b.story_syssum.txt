The documents were made public while the office investigates reports of sexual misconduct by Secret Service personnel with prostitutes in Colombia ahead of President Barack Obama's visit to the Summit of the Americas in Cartagena this spring.
Another allegation made October 23, 2003, said that an agent forced a female acquaintance to have non-consensual sex with him at a hotel in Killeen, Texas.
The allegation was that FBI wiretaps recorded calls from two phones and the numbers traced back to the unidentified agent.
A redacted October 7, 2010, entry with no specifics says there was a report a Secret Service employee might have been involved in the leak of national security information.
Bill Hillburg, a spokesman for the Office of Inspector General agreed that only a small number of the reports dealt with allegations against the Secret Service.
"While some of the allegations proved to be unfounded or frivolous, others appear to be legitimate, and that adds to my concern about apparent misconduct by some of the personnel of this vital law enforcement agency," said Collins, whose committee is investigating the Colombia incident.
Collins added that in her committee's hearing last month, it was revealed there have been 64 allegations of sexual misconduct by Secret Service employees over the past five years.
A dozen members of the military were also involved.
