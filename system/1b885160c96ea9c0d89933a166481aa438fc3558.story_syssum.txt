For Wang is one of the few insiders who dare to speak publicly about something most people in China only whisper about: the fall of the man once touted as a potential Chinese president.
"Several foreign media have told me they cannot find one single person to speak in the vast city of Chongqing.
He is a well-known identity, plugged into local politics and personally familiar with the people at the center of this scandal, which has grown to encompass a murder investigation, allegations of spying, and rumored sexual affairs that have led to the sacking of the party chief, who until last month ruled the city with an iron fist.
On the streets he won praise, but to his critics Bo was orchestrating a naked power grab, wiping out rivals and enemies.
"None of the other politicians has ever done that.
This particular path has lead to Bo's own ruin.
Diplomatic, political and business sources now paint a picture of a man fearing for his life after linking Bo's own wife to the murder of a British businessman.
"It's said in the official report that Gu was involved in the murder of Heywood.
Intimate relations, suspected murder, political intrigue: all of it leading to a hotel on the outskirts of Chongqing.
But from this rundown hotel, to the corridors of the Great Hall of the People, the downfall of Bo and his wife is not just about a family in disgrace.
One leader has fallen, but Wang says China may have taken big steps to saving itself in the process.
