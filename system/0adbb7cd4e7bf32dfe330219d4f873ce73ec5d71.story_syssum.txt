(CNN)When Longmont, Colorado, police officer Billy Sawyer responded to a 911 call from a pregnant woman who was stabbed and had her fetus ripped out, he wasn't prepared for what they would see.
"She's an amazing woman to have that will and that drive to survive and do what she did and be able to contact the police and tell us where she was at, where inside of that location she was at, and speak to me as I entered the residence, direct me to her location," Sawyer said.
The grisly cutting of the fetus from Wilkins began when she responded to a Craigslist ad about baby clothes for sale.
"She is probably one of the strongest people I've ever had the pleasure to meet," Piotrowski said.
But Piotrowski believes Wilkins is the one who "saved her own life."
The murder charge would reportedly depend on whether the fetus was old enough to have lived outside of her mother's body.
