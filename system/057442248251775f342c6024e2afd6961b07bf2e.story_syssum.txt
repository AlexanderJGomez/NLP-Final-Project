The rumors are patently false, they say, and it's frustrating to have to deal with them while also battling a genuine crisis.
The floodwaters at Fort Calhoun are outside the plant.
There is no water inside the plant.
The floodwaters are outside Fort Calhoun, not inside," Gates explains.
The buildings housing the reactor core, the spent fuel rods and other crucial components are protected by small levees and aqua-berms.
"Maintaining electrical power, operating the pumps, is our biggest concern for the station, and we're able to fully do that at this time," Nellenbach says.
Now, they anticipate the plant will remain offline through the month of August, until the floodwaters completely recede.
Gates and his colleagues say the water has not breached the buildings housing the reactor core and the spent fuel rods, and they're confident it won't.
Gates says the Nuclear Regulatory Commission cited the Fort Calhoun plant in 2009 for not being adequately prepared for a flooding event.
