The death of Dawn Brancheau was an occasion of almost unbearable sadness for those closest to Dawn -- her family, friends and colleagues at SeaWorld.
The three years since Dawn's death have seen the emergence of individuals who have chosen not to honor her memory, but rather to use the events of February 24, 2010, to advance their own interests.
The tragedy of Dawn's death cannot and has not been ignored, but neither should the literally millions of safe interactions we have had with killer whales over that span of time.
There is no acknowledgment anywhere in the film of the great things SeaWorld does every day or the simple fact that our animals are healthy and passionately cared for.
The care and educational presentation of these animals at SeaWorld has been made safer than ever.
And by that omission the film reveals itself not as a work of objective documentary filmmaking, but rather as something closer to propaganda.
Despite what the makers of this film may suggest, SeaWorld is the kind of organization that draws dedicated and passionate people like Dawn Brancheau.
