It's just a coincidence that the release of the Michael Jackson King of Pop slot game on Tuesday is occurring along with the trial of the performer's physician, Conrad Murray, who's charged with involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death, said a spokesman for Bally Technologies.
"Slot machines generally speaking are the most profitable for the casino, and they are the most cynical in their design," said Marc Cooper, an associate journalism professor at the University of Southern California and author of "The Last Honest Place in America: Paradise and Perdition in the New Las Vegas."
"We started the process about a year ago," said Mike Mitchell, vice president of game design at Bally, adding that's when the firm negotiated the licensing of Jackson's music and videos with several parties, including Jackson's family and estate.
The game is designed so that during bonus rounds, Jackson's sequin glove shows the player where to touch the screen to spin a gaming wheel, designed like an album, to try to win a credit, Bally spokesmen said.
The game targets people who grew up to MTV and recall Jackson's original videos, Bally executives said.
David G. Schwartz, director of the center for gaming research at University of Nevada at Las Vegas, said the game is being rolled out just as the global audiences are watching the televised manslaughter trial and learning the stark circumstances of Jackson's death.
"It has an 'immersive' aspect that is coming out in a lot of games now," said Schwartz, who reviews gambling trends for Las Vegas publications and on his blog and dgschwartz.com website.
