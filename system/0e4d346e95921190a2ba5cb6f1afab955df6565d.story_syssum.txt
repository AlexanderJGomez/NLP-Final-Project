"If you look at the big races, there are not many horses who win them without good names," British racing commentator Cornelius Lysaght said.
It created a certain mystique around the horse."
Then there's the holy grail of names considered so important, they can never be used again.
One loophole does allow horses from different countries to have the same name -- provided they include the nation's prefix at the end.
The names of terrorist organizations such as Al Qaeda and IRA have also been turned away, though Weatherbys racing director Paull Khan admitted suspect names had "slipped through the net" in the past.
In Britain, people would generally be quite flattered to have a horse named after them, but in France it would more likely be seen as an insult," he said.
"The Queen is renowned for naming her horses sensible, quite cleverly constructed words -- like Sea Shanty."
"Camelot's owners reserved the name 10 years ago -- they thought it was a marvelous name but there was no horse that came up to scratch," Lysaght said.
"I think it holds the most sway at something like the Grand National in Britain, where you've got a large proportion of inexpert betters," Khan said.
That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet."
