Prosecutors say Komisarjevsky is one of two men who broke into the home of Dr. William Petit and raped and killed Petit's wife, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her two daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, before setting fire to the home.
He was then tied to a pole in the family's basement, but could hear "loud thuds" and "moaning," likely from his wife.
In his opening statement defense attorney Walter Bansley told jurors that his client never intended to kill anyone and that his sole purpose in breaking into the Petit home was to steal.
He told jurors that in order to convict his client of capital murder, they must determine he intended to kill someone.
