The Walnut Creek branch of the Contra Costa County Superior Court closed early Monday because of the rallies, and all cases that were scheduled to be heard Monday afternoon were postponed.
The Justice for Oscar Grant supporters started their demonstration across the street but then moved onto the sidewalk in front the courthouse where the Mehserle supporters were demonstrating.
Police in riot gear placed metal barriers to keep the two sides apart.
The Walnut Creek police department called in most of its police personnel and civilian staff for duty, and the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Office helped provide security.
Supporters of Mehserle say the killing was a "tragic mistake" and say they called the rally to show support for police.
The website for the Justice for Oscar Grant Committee added, "Oscar Grant was a young Black man returning home by way of the Fruitvale BART station after celebrating the New Year.
Mehserle faces two to four years in prison at his scheduled August 6 sentencing.
Although police said they were prepared for possible clashes, some people in this normally placid town were not unduly concerned that the rallies might get out of control, even though protests after the verdict in nearby Oakland led to the arrest of 78 people.
Mehserle and other Bay Area Rapid Transit police had been called to the Fruitvale station after passengers complained about fights on a train.
The earlier Oakland demonstrations were called in response to Mehserle's acquittal on second-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter charges.
