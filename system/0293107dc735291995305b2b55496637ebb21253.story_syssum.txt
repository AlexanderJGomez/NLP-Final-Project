Oceanside, New York (CNN) -- Deployed to a volatile outpost in southern Afghanistan where U.S. Marines routinely face a mix of skirmishes and hidden explosives, Greg Buckley Jr. sensed that an attack was imminent.
But the trainee apparently wouldn't relent, repeating the phrases for hours over the course of a night in which the young Marine was on guard watch.
The two men then finally confronted each other, yelling until a group of officers separated them, he told his father.
"One of his superiors came over and had Greg apologize to the guy," said the elder Buckley.
On August 10, 2012, Greg Buckley Jr. was gunned down by the very forces he had been training, just days after learning that he was to head home early.
It has become disturbingly more frequent in Afghanistan, with more than 50 NATO troops killed this year by local forces, the first time that's happened in a single year in the U.S.-led war.
More than a decade after the war began, the Buckley family is now struggling to cope with the loss of its eldest son.

After crossing into the end zone, Justin raised his hand to salute -- honoring his fallen brother.
