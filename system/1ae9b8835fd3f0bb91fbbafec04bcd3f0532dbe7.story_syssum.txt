Earlier this week, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said the United States' criticisms of Gadhafi had a clear aim: military invasion.
"Let's not get carried away by the drums of war, because the United States, I am sure that they are exaggerating and distorting things to justify an invasion," Chavez said Monday, according to Venezuelan state media.
As rumors swirled about Gadhafi and his whereabouts last week, some suggested that he may be en route to Venezuela.
But there is no doubt that, regarding Libya, a campaign of lies is being woven -- the same that has been woven about Venezuela for a long time," he said.
The U.N. Security Council over the weekend voted for tough restrictions and possible war crimes charges against the Libyan regime.
