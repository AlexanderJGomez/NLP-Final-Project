iReporter Chelsea Itson, a 23-year-old student, went to the 12:15 a.m. showing in Perrysburg, Ohio, and couldn't sleep afterward.
Itson saw the first "Batman" movie, but wasn't a big fan of the series, or Heath Ledger, but said her friend wanted to go.
"There was already a line going along the side of the theater, but we managed to get good seats anyway," she said.
She and her friends went straight to bed after work Thursday, then got up at 1 a.m.
"One of the things I just really love is the energy of the crowd on opening day.
It's worth staying up for," the 32-year-old publications manager said.
Stop reading this right now and go to the nearest movie theater.
mrRG: "A haunting experiment into the human psyche is the only way I can describe the unequivocal depth that Ledger was able to reach with this portrayal of one the most evil characters ever brought to the screen.
It is sad to think he will never reprise this role, but what a farewell.
Both have their unique styles -- Nicholson's Joker was more comical, but Ledger's was more dark (while trying to be funny).
The makeup artists also did a great job on this Joker's face.
