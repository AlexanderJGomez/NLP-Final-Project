"We have decided to restore flights by Russian strategic aviation on a permanent basis," Putin told reporters after inspecting joint military exercises with China and four Central Asian states in Russia's Ural mountains.
"Militaries around the world engage in a variety of activities, so this is not entirely surprising," he said.
Western military leaders have said this year that Russian flights near their airspace were becoming more frequent after a long quiet period.
That appeared to be a swipe at the U.S. and NATO, whose strategic bombers have continued to fly long-range missions.
In July, two Russian Tu-95 "Bear" bombers made unusually long sorties over the North Sea, leading Norway and Britain to scramble fighter jets to follow them.
