It's just me inside my shelter, listening to the howl of the weather and racing to eat everything in the fridge before it spoils and has to be tossed into a garbage bag.
In the dark, I sit in front of a rectangular glowing screen, a reminder that my separation from technology is only temporary until someone comes and repairs the lines.
For now, I send texts from time to time, just to make sure others are OK, to let them know I am thinking of them as we sit in the darkness listening to the world outside.
They made a mad scramble into the attic, listening to the wind batter the walls of the house as the water slowly rose up the stairs.
I grew up not with a fear of hurricanes but rather a conviction that they had to be dealt with using a mix of careful planning and complete concession to the whims of nature.
Later, my mother described to me how the entire building shook from side to side while the winds tore through the city.
Since I didn't have the capability to deal with what had happened, I chose to run in the other direction.
I'm calm still as I sit in the dark, looking at the frayed electrical wires dangling from the poles outside the window.
It's coming face to face with something of great power, and knowing it's OK to be small and vulnerable in the face of it.
After so many years of hurricanes, you start to develop the same feel for them that a farmer does when he licks a finger and sticks it in the air to find out which way the wind is blowing.
