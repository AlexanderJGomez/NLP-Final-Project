Washington (CNN) -- An undercover investigation by the Federal Trade Commission found funeral homes nationwide deceived customers into making purchases they weren't required to make and failed to give up-front pricing to customers.
In those cases, the FTC contacted the funeral homes and required proof they were addressing violations.
A three-year program run by the National Funeral Directors Association gives participants extra training and additional compliance monitoring.
Since the annual undercover stings began in 1996, the FTC said investigators have found fewer than 400 funeral homes with significant violations.
