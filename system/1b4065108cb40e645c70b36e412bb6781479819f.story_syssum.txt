Mitrice Richardson, a 24-year-old former beauty pageant contestant, was last seen leaving a Malibu, California, sheriff's station in the early morning hours of September 17.
Jeff Peterson, the owner of the restaurant, told CNN in September that he called police because he feared for her safety.
Sutton alleges that she made numerous calls to the sheriff's station that night to find out when her daughter would be released so Sutton could pick her up.
A spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department told "Issues" that "all indications that night were that Mitrice was doing OK. She took sobriety tests, signed documents, talked to the jailer.
