Cabri Chamberlin, then a freshman, said she was raped by another student last May at the Xi Chapter of Psi Upsilon fraternity house in Middletown, Connecticut, at a pledge "strip show," says the suit, which was filed Tuesday in a Connecticut federal court.
Chamberlin, who has taken a leave from her studies, said she became extremely uncomfortable, put on her jacket and attempted to leave when a male student picked her up from behind and raped her in the presence of "numerous others," according to the lawsuit.
After an internal investigation, the university expelled the alleged perpetrator and imposed "sanctions against the fraternity and members," according to a statement by Wesleyan President Michael S. Roth.
The fraternity allegedly failed to adequately provide its own security, and the defendants failed to train themselves in safety and risk management issues, including sexual abuse prevention, hazing and the misuse of alcohol, according to the lawsuit.
"All have seen increased scrutiny over the past few years," Roth said of fraternities.
Sexual violence on college campuses is a national problem, and it's important to raise awareness about this issue.
In 2012, a Wesleyan student sued the university and another fraternity, which Wesleyan no longer recognizes as a student organization, after she said she was raped in its frat house two years before.
The case was settled in court-ordered mediation in August 2013.
