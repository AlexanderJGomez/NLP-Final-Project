(CNN) -- A former Florida middle school principal stabbed four people Friday at a group home for the hearing impaired, killing two of them, then struck five others with a car, the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office said.
The suspect fled the scene and headed toward a motel in nearby Pinellas Park, where a man and woman were assaulted, authorities said.
From there, the suspect left and is thought to have spoken briefly to people outside a duplex before abruptly leaving, then returning in his vehicle -- slamming into three women and one man in the process.
Barreda explained that the sheriff's office is only responsible for levying charges in certain areas, adding that Giancola could face more charges from police in other jurisdictions for the alleged assaults and hit-and-runs.
Giancola said at his sentencing that he hoped to become a drug counselor after being released from jail.
Then, in early 2010, Giancola was arrested again and charged on two counts -- intent to purchase cocaine and loitering -- according to online records from the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office.
