Haymanot never expected himself - or his store -- to become targets of threats and violence in a metropolitan city known for its tolerance.
His fear has been growing for many months because illegal African immigrants have attracted anger in certain parts of Israel -- and Haymanot believes the color of his skin makes him vulnerable -- because many here will assume if you're black in his Tel Aviv neighborhood -- you are here illegally.
Most of the new arrivals are from Eritrea and Sudan, and the government says they come illegally through the Egyptian border.
His words echo the call from the United Nations for Eritreans to be given refugee status due to conditions in their home country.
The current Israeli policy leaves the immigrants in an unsustainable holding pattern, says Weitzen: They are not allowed to legally work but do so anyway, leaves residents frustrated as the number of poor grow in certain neighborhoods, putting pressure on everything from housing to hospitals.
Three members of the right wing Likud party -- part of the governing coalition - were among the politicians who attended.
In two separate cases in May, two African illegal immigrants were arrested and charged with raping teenage Israeli girls, sparking even more tension between the communities in some parts of the country.
Dror Kahalani, a community activist who has lived in the neighborhood for 45 years, said through tears that he knows the immigrants are human beings and need help -- but that it's not up to residents to foot the bill for them.
Amene Tekele Haymanot, who works and lives in Hatikva, says that his Israeli neighbors continue to make threats and intimidate him even after breaking apart his business.
He says Israelis in the neighborhood threatened to kill him and burn his place down.
