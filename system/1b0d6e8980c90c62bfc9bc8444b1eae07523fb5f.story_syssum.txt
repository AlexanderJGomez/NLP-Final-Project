"He doesn't seem to have much control of anything," U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters Tuesday.
Professor Abubaker Saad, a former Gadhafi aide, on Tuesday described to CNN a system of bunkers under the Gadhafi compound in Tripoli that could serve as a hideout.
There has been speculation that tunnels might lead from Gadhafi's now-overrun bunker to the Rixos hotel, where about 35 journalists are being held against their will by low-ranking Gadhafi loyalists.
The United States wants Gadhafi to issue "a reliable, affirmative statement" to the international community and his loyalists still fighting in Tripoli "that he understands ... his leadership is over, so everyone can move on," Nuland said.
There has been nothing to confirm some reports or speculation that the longtime leader has gone to his hometown of Sirte, the official said.
Gadhafi and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez have a close relationship forged in part by shared opposition to U.S. influence around the globe.
"From here we confirm our solidarity with the Libyan people, our brother that is being assaulted and bombed ... as part of the imperial insanity," Chavez said during a meeting of government ministers in Caracas, the state-run AVN news agency reported.
However, Gadhafi's relationship with Saudi Arabia has cooled since the Saudis accused Libyans of trying to kill their king several years ago, and it would be unlikely for the desert kingdom to accept an exiled Gadhafi now, according to Christopher Boucek, a Saudi Arabia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
