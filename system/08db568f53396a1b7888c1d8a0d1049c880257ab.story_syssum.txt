Even if automobiles aren't your thing, the Firebird's bizarre wings and bubble cockpit are worth a peek.
When you first walk into the exhibit, it's clear these cars aren't designed for mere mortals.
You can be sure the Da Vinci of General Motors -- legendary designer Harley Earl -- put just as much imagination into his jet-plane-looking Firebird as old Leonardo did with that smirking Mona.
-- Not a clown car: The 1970 Lancia Stratos HF Zero measures only 33 inches from its rooftop to the floor.
"You can fetishize just about any detail on the Bugatti you like, from the grill to every bolt," a man standing nearby says to me.
Instead we're hypnotized by the cars and their dramatic, sweeping lines and their chrome-spangled cockpits.
Two of the exhibit's creators -- Ken Gross and Sarah Schleuning -- showed me around a little.
As Gross puts it: "Car designers are the rock stars of the automobile industry and they always have been."
When it came to car design, Earl pushed the industry to put style as a top priority, says Schleuning, the museum's curator of decorative arts and design.
-- It's the first two-section gas turbine powered car to be built and tested in the U.S.
Back in 1951, New York's Museum of Modern Art opened an exhibit featuring eight cars described as elegant and exotic.
Maybe increased interest within America's art community will stoke the fire, and keep the romance burning a little longer.
