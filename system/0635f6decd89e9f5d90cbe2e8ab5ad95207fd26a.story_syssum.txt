In a tearful speech Raul said his decision to leave was a "painful one, but I think it is also the correct one," and said his next destination will be a club in Germany or England.
Raul won six Spanish league titles and three Champions League crowns during his stay at Madrid, and he told fans who gathered to mark his departure that he would support Real Madrid wherever he went.
It was a long, hard decision, but this isn't a goodbye, but rather a see you later.
Tributes poured into Raul from his teammates, including Cristiano Ronaldo who told the club's official website: "Playing by Raul's side has been an honor.
The incredible histories of clubs are written by great footballers, and Raul is one of them."
There are many men who form part of the legend of Real Madrid but few that are chosen to embody the club - Raul is one of those."
