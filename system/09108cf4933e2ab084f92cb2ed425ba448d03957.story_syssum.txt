That John-Paul II, whose pontificate dominated the late 20th century, is on a fast-track to sainthood should not come as a surprise.
A Vatican spokesman emphasized that because "no one doubts" John's holiness, Pope Francis has decided to move forward with the dual canonization.
At its most basic, Catholics believe, a saint is a holy person through whom God intervenes after his or her death to aid the living.
As with so many other Catholic procedures, the reform movements in the medieval papacy gradually asserted control of the process of canonization.
By the time of the great medieval reform movements, most popes did not become saints and were not expected to do so, as sanctity became reserved for those not so deeply involved in worldly affairs.
John Paul II's sainthood has been promoted by many of the more conservative elements within the Catholic world.
