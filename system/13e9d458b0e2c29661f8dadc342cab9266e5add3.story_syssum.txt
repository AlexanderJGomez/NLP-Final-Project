But, according to authorities in Jefferson Parish, his account of practicing "WWE"-style wrestling moves by punching, jumping on and slamming his 5-year-old half-sister to the bed was all too real, and fatal.
He "was smiling and appeared as though he took great pride in what he was doing," sheriff's Col. John Fortunato told CNN on Wednesday.
An external examination of the little girl by the coroner's office noted no obvious signs of trauma or major injuries, and her death was listed as unclassified.
The boy smiled and appeared to enjoy talking about the wrestling moves, authorities said.
It said authorities determined Viloude's death was "not an accidental death due to a wrestling move.
The mother will not face charges, according to Fortunato.
