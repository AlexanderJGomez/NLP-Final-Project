Jonathan Fleming, 52, who was released from prison in April after spending 24 years and 8 months in prison for the slaying of Darryl Rush in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, filed the notice signaling his intent to sue the city, the police department and the King County district attorney's office on Tuesday.
Fleming had always maintained that he was on a family trip to Disney World in Florida when Rush was shot to death early on the morning of August 15, 1989, in a dispute over stolen money.
But, according to Koss, they did not have evidence he was in Florida on the day of the slaying.
Fleming told his attorneys he had paid a bill for phone calls made from his Florida hotel room the night before Rush was killed, and he believed the receipt was in his pocket when police arrested him.
She later testified in front of a judge that she was on parole and had been arrested with another woman for being in a stolen van the night of the killing.
Koss said defense investigators even found a witness in South Carolina who claims to have been the getaway driver during Rush's killing and who identified someone they say is the real killer.
