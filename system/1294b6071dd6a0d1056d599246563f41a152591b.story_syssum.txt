Taking a cue from some of its competitors, Apple on Tuesday announced a smaller version of its popular iPad tablet -- the iPad Mini.
It will have the same display-resolution specs as last year's iPad 2, not the high-definition "retina display" of the newest iPad, which also got an update on Tuesday.
The device's screen has the same proportions as the larger iPads, meaning that apps designed for the tablet should also look good on the Mini.
Leaks ahead of the event sketched out most of the relevant details, from dimensions of the smaller iPad to what sizes it would come in.
said Schiller, while presenting an update of the company's smallest desktop computer, the Mac mini.
It weighs 3.5 pounds, making it the lightest MacBook Pro ever, Schiller said.
Released only six months ago, Apple's newest full-sized iPad also got an update, getting a faster A6X processing chip, an improved camera and, like the iPhone 5, 4G LTE capabilities.
Ads for the tablet showed people reclining in various environments, clutching the iPad like a book.
"If you can do everything on the smaller iPad you can on the larger iPad -- that plus the added convenience of being able to take it with you more places could take the wind out of the sales of Amazon."
That would also be a boost for Apple in the education market, which it has been courting heavily.
