"I had come from the U.S. last night and was sleeping in my room at the ninth floor when at 10:30 p.m., I suddenly heard noises in the lobby.
When I inquired, one of the hotel occupants told me that some terrorists have entered the place and are threatening the people," said a person name Punya, who was staying at the Taj Mahal Hotel.
Punya was holed up in the hotel for 15 hours before he was able to escape at 1:30 p.m. local time.
There were two gunmen, young boys, maybe 20 years old ... 25.
They wanted anyone with British or American passport ... so I guess they were after foreigners."
"I was fortunate to have managed to escape the hostage situation at the Taj hotel located near the Gateway of India.
I had come down to Mumbai to meet a business client at the Taj hotel.
"At around 9 p.m., all of us came to the ground floor to have dinner.
We were in the swimming pool area and asked to lie on the ground.
One injured foreigner was also with us.
You cannot tell who the victims were or their age; they were injured so badly.
The gunmen then asked if any of the hostages were British or American, Chamberlain told SkyNews.com.
"The smoke was so thick, I thought we were going to suffocate," he told SkyNews.com.
"@#$%&* in bed trying to sleep... just heard another blast!
