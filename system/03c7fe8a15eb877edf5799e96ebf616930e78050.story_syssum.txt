LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN)  -- The imprisoned leader of the Nigerian militant group MEND has accepted an unconditional amnesty offer from the government, his lawyer said Friday.
"We support Henry Okah's decision to accept any deal that will ensure his early release to attend to his failing health under the current circumstances," said Jomo Gbomo, a MEND spokesman.
MEND has declared an "all-out war" on the government, demanding a fairer distribution of oil wealth in the Niger Delta.
"The recent appointment of Mr. Timi Alaibe as the special adviser to the president on Niger Delta-Nigeria-MEND-Amnesty affairs by the Nigerian government is a humble and welcome development that is in line with the two-pronged approach of our current campaign," the statement said.
