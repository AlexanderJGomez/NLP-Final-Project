(CNN) -- Much has been said about Kim Kardashian in the weeks leading up to her wedding, and now the reality star is speaking for herself.

After Kardashian got those wedding-related thoughts off her chest, she turned to a more serious matter: how being a mother of a mixed-race child has affected her understanding of racism.
"I feel a responsibility as a mother, a public figure, a human being, to do what I can to make sure that not only my child, but all children, don't have to grow up in a world where they are judged by the color of their skin, or their gender, or their sexual orientation," Kardashian concluded.
