I should have let you wear all the make-up in the world," Zenani's mother Zoleka Mandela said in a message read by a family friend at the service, according to the Mandela Foundation.
Her uncle, Prince Zinhle Dlamini, told mourners that she had met Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo on her birthday.
"She was a precious little girl who shined bright for everyone to see," he said, choking up, the foundation said.
Mandela, who is 91, has limited his public appearances recently, although he did meet the South Africa soccer squad before the World Cup began.
