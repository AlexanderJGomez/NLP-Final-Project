Opinions expressed in the rapid-fire Twitter echo chamber, particularly in response to political news, are often at odds with the general public's.
"Overall, the reaction to political events on Twitter reflects a combination of the unique profile of active Twitter users and the extent to which events engage different communities and draw the comments of active users," the report reads.
Similarly, only 20% of the public told pollsters they thought Obama did a better job than Romney in their first debate (the one in which Obama was criticized for looking tired and unfocused).
And 57% of those who posted news on Twitter were either Democrats or leaned Democratic, compared with 46% of the general public.
The reason for such a swing, Pew said, is that on Twitter, unlike in opinion polls, users decide what they think is important enough to mention publicly.
Politics also reflect a truth that anyone who's followed the Oscars, Super Bowl, debate nights or, really, any public event can attest to -- the Twitter universe is never happier than when it's being snarky, or downright nasty, to someone.
Another thing to keep in mind when monitoring the conversation on Twitter: While it seems to be omnipresent among the digitally connected (yes, like we journalists tend to be), its overall reach is modest compared to other media.
Only 3% said they regularly or sometimes tweet or retweet news or news headlines on Twitter.
