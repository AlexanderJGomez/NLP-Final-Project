Those funds, part of the President's 2015 budget, which must still be approved by Congress, would nearly double the amount of federal money allocated to the fight.
The plan calls for creating a "one-health" approach to testing and reporting superbugs around the country, as well as establishing a DNA database of resistant bacteria.
A key goal is to slow the growth and spread of superbugs by reducing the use of antibiotics when they aren't needed.
A recent survey of 796 health care professionals found 63% of the sample prescribed antibiotics when they weren't absolutely necessary, at least 10% of the time.
Another part of the plan pledges to eliminate the widespread use of antibiotics to boost the growth of animals raised for food.
"With 80% of the antibiotics produced in the United States being used in agriculture mostly for prevention," said Louise Slaughter, D-New York, who has an alternate proposal in front of Congress, "any meaningful solution to the looming antibiotic resistance crisis must begin with limits on the farm.
Trusting a voluntary policy that lets industry police itself will not bring about real change."
