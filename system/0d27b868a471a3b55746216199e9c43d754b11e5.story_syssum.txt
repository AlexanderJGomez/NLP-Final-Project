As a new mom in the district, I'm being pitched pretty hard by the PTA.
On Monday I went to a breakfast put on by the PTA—I mostly went just to check it out (and to avoid my deadline) but I wound up signing up for six or seven committees.
She was also the CCD teacher, the Girl Scout leader, the carpool driver and pretty much everything else you'd find under the overarching title of Kick-Ass Stay-At-Home-Mom.
I'm still feeling the after-effects of my all-encompassing (and beyond worth it) LLS campaign and have already signed up to be a big part of that event again this year.
I try not to do anything half assed but I also have a tendency to not say no enough.
And so I over commit and then I feel overwhelmed and I hate to feel overwhelmed.
Bottom line is this: One of the main reasons I left the full-time, editor-at-a-magazine (with benefits and health insurance) world years ago is so that I would be able to have an active role in my kids' day-to-day lives.
A new friend at the bus stop gave me good advice, which was to sign up for the PTA activities that get you face time with your kid—working an event that the kindergarteners will attend, for example, as opposed to something for the older students.
I signed up for several different committees (including something having to do with gardening and one about recycling, which are both in my wheelhouse) and I figure I'll dabble for a bit, get to see what it's all about and then go from there.
