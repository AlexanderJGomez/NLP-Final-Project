For one, every tech journalist on earth has been writing about the new-now-next-generation iPhone since the company's last "Jesus phone" -- the iPhone 4 -- graced us with its presence in June 2010.
The tech specs of the new phone are still hotly debated, as reporters scour Apple patents, SKU codes and, of course, Bay Area bars for any remaining iPhone-rumor morsels sure to grab the public's attention.
The Wall Street Journal was reporting Monday that Sprint Nextel has entered into an eye-opening agreement with Apple to buy more than $20 billion worth of iPhones over the next four years.
-- PC World (irony noted) expects the iPad's faster processor to squeeze its way into the iPhone.
-- It may employ new voice-recognition features, says Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster.
Some bloggers have taken to calling it the iCloud Phone, because it could tie in with Apple's new cloud-computing services.
-- Based on Apple's past iPhone release patterns, the phone (or phones) will likely go on sale later this month (most bloggers predict mid-October).
And there are rumors that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who handed over the company to Cook in August following a medical leave of absence, will make an appearance at the event.
