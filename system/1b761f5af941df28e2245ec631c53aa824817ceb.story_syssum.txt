In what is only her second announced appearance on the trail for a candidate, Obama will stump for Bruce Braley, a four-term Democratic congressman seeking the open seat.

Earlier this week, the first lady debuted on the campaign trail, stumping for Michelle Nunn in Georgia.
The Des Moines Register first reported Obama's plans.
