When the Board of Visitors at the University of Virginia pressured President Teresa Sullivan to resign on June 10, she became the fourth leader of a flagship public university to leave office under a cloud of controversy recently.
Our nation's public universities are the heart and soul of our higher education system, which is the envy of the world.
They also attract the largest number of foreign students.
Governors and legislators want all these benefits as they continue to reduce state expenditures for higher education.
You need extended time and personal contact for young minds to mature as effective thinkers.
Governors and legislators have a strong argument about the elitism, the inefficiency and the sometime self-serving nature of university faculty.
Professors have a strong case for the merits of what they do, and the remarkable record of achievements and historical job-creation coming out of our best public universities.
Although alumni want their universities to be the best in the world, their support (as generous as it may be) cannot replace government money.
The National Institutes of Health, for example, is the dominant funder for medical research in the world.
University presidents should be empowered to pursue these goals, in a reasonable time frame, with transparent accountability.
We need leaders in government and on campus with the same vision -- the same desire to use limited resources not as instruments for political or personal advantage, but as opportunities for constructive engagement and the greatest long-term public good.
Public universities need protection and they also need serious, thoughtful reform.
