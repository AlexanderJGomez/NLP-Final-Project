To say the author and the convicted killer have a history would be an understatement.
MacDonald's lawyers assert that newly-discovered DNA evidence -- three hairs that match neither MacDonald nor any of the victims -- and the secondhand confession of a key witness who claimed to be at the family's home the night of the murders justify reopening the case.
It is expected to take weeks, perhaps months, before a ruling comes in a criminal saga that has made headlines for four decades.
MacDonald, a captain assigned to the Green Berets, also sustained a collapsed lung and two stab wounds in what he said was an attack on his family by a trio of intruders, including a woman in a floppy hat who chanted "Acid is groovy" and "Kill the pigs."
The Army investigated first, and MacDonald was cleared at a closed military hearing.
MacDonald has always insisted he is innocent, so the recent developments in the case come as no surprise to McGinniss.
MacDonald's appeals received renewed attention with the release this month of the book "A Wilderness of Error: The Trials of Jeffrey MacDonald."

Stoeckley, who died in 1983, had admitted to others that she was present for the killings but she denied it on the witness stand at MacDonald's trial.
Journalist Janet Malcolm wrote a widely read article about the case and was critical of McGinniss, accusing him of deceiving MacDonald by pretending to believe he was innocent after becoming convinced of his guilt.
In court, MacDonald literally seemed to McGinniss to be a ghost from the past.
