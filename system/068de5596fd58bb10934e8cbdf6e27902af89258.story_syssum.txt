(CNN) -- The American Civil Liberties Union has called on officials in Massachusetts and Florida to conduct independent investigations into the shooting death of a man by an FBI agent.
A U.S. government official briefed on the FBI investigation told CNN in May that Todashev had agreed to talk to authorities and noted he was never arrested or handcuffed.
After one of the detectives left the room, the other noticed Todashev was acting odd, and he texted that sense to the FBI agent with him -- the U.S. official told CNN.
A law enforcement official told CNN that Todashev attacked the FBI agent with a broom handle, not a sword.
