In the latest twist to a downfall triggered by more recordings, the Los Angeles Clippers' owner allegedly threatened to "take out" his wife's lawyer and sue two doctors who declared him mentally unfit.
In the message, he identifies himself and expresses anger about the release of his medical records.
Both will present their evidence in court on behalf of Shelly Sterling, who's vying to uphold a negotiated sale of the Clippers.
She asked a judge to order her husband and his legal team to stop contacting and harassing witnesses involved in the court battle.
If one of the trustees is declared mentally incapacitated, the other becomes the lone trustee, according to records.
