There are a few thousand Egyptians left in Tunisia awaiting evacuation after more than 40,000 were taken home, said Firas Kayal, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency, on Saturday.
On Sunday, the British government said it will provide emergency evacuation flights to repatriate 500 stranded Bangladeshis.
Meanwhile, three people died and 14 were missing when they tried to get off a ship headed from Libya's capital, Tripoli, to Crete, the Greek Ministry for the Protection of Civilians said Sunday.
"From the evidence gathered so far, it appears the passengers were trying to disembark the 'Ionian King' (Cypriot flag) using a rope," the ministry said in a statement.
"A lot of them were scared from leaving because of the fighting so they were staying in their houses," he said Saturday.
