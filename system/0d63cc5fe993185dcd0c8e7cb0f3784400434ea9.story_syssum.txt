Police also announced the arrest of the man they say killed Anjelica and dumped her body along the Henry Hudson Parkway.
Detectives from the New York Police Department's Cold Case Apprehension Squad never stopped searching for answers in the case.
It led detectives to Anjelica's sister, now an adult; from there, they identified the woman believed to be the girl's mother, he said.
She had been smothered and sexually molested, and her body was so badly decomposed that several sketches were made to suggest what she looked like.
Juarez, who was 30 at the time of the crime, said he went to an apartment in Queens shared by seven of his relatives and saw Anjelica in the hallway, Kelly said.
Juarez and his sister hailed a cab to Manhattan, dropped the cooler off in a wooded area near the parkway, and then went their separate ways, authorities said.
He said he was certain the killer was Anjelica's mother, father, or both.
Kelly praised the "phenomenal persistence" of the detectives who originally worked on the case and those now working with the cold case squad.
"They were unrelenting," he said.
