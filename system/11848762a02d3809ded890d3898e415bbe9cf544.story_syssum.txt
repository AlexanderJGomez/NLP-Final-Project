Tesla Motors, maker of a high-end electric sports car, says it will build an all-electric sedan in Southern California.
It is widely believed that the Model S sedan will be built near the Space Exploration Technologies Corporation facility in Hawthorne.
Recently though, the economic downturn has forced Tesla to delay production of their would-be flagship Model S until 2011.
The company faces many challenges, the foremost of which is convincing consumers to pay almost $50,000 for an all-electric sedan when they could pay thousands less for another brand of upmarket sedan or a gas-electric hybrid.
