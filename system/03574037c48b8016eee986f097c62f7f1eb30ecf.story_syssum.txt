Clashes between the two sides began last Friday, with each country accusing the other of trying to seize two ancient temples.
Both sides claim the disputed temples are in their country.
In February, at least 10 people were killed when fighting flared up in another disputed border area between the two nations, prompting the United Nations Security Council to issue a statement calling on both sides to implement a cease-fire.
Those clashes, which lasted four days, stemmed from a longstanding conflict related to the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple.
