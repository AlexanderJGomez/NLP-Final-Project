Graham, 21, wearing a purple sweater and blue jean blouse, took the stand to testify that doubts about her marriage had escalated into a physical altercation during a trail hike.
Her federal public defender Michael Donahoe has asserted in court documents that his death was an accident.
"Under oath you said, 'During the entire time I was in the room by myself with Agent Smiedala, he never took his hands off my knee,'" McClean said, seeking to underscore the time discrepancy between her testimony and her signed affidavit.
In his testimony about interrogation methods, agent Smiedala denied physically touching Graham's leg, saying he only tried to verbally console her after she broke down in tears after confessing.
Only after a FBI agent Smiedala showed her a surveillance photo of the couple entering the gates to Glacier National Park did Graham change her story and confess to pushing him off the ledge.
Prosecutors have theorized that Graham blindfolded her husband before pushing him to his death and then lied to cover up the crime, according to motions filed by the defense.
Donahoe said federal attorneys have not disclosed any evidence of the premeditation alleged in the first-degree murder charge except for mentioning during a recent telephone conference that "the government now believes Jordan placed a blindfold on Cody before pushing him off the ledge," court documents show.
