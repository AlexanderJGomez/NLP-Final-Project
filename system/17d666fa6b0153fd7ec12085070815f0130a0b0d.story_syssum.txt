The investigations into the death of Moammar Gadhafi after his capture last year could also be completed soon, Fawzy Abdilal said.
Human Rights Watch said after visiting Saif al-Islam in custody last year that he should have a lawyer, but Abdilal implied he had not asked for one.
Moammar Gadhafi was killed in October, two months after he was deposed by rebel fighters.
"It was a battlefield, he was carrying weapons, there were fighters around, no one was controlling those fighters," Abdilal said.
