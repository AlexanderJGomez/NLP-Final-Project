Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The sisters of a Los Angeles woman found dead in Cancun, Mexico, in April want the U.S. government to explain why her husband has not been arrested a month after Mexican prosecutors requested his extradition.
A spokesman for the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, who would pursue an arrest, said Thursday that nothing has been filed in California.
His passport was taken by investigators, and he was told not to leave Mexico until the inquiry was concluded.
Beresford-Redman returned home in May, without the knowledge of investigators, to take care of family business and see his two young children, his lawyer said.
A source close to the wife has said that she cleaned out the family's bank account and took her two children to Hawaii because she was upset about her husband's extramarital affair.
