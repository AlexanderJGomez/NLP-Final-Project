Amidst the roars, step forward Marcel Hirscher, the 23-year-old with the weight of all Austria on his shoulders.
On Sunday, faced with his last chance of chance of glory, the home favorite delivered, sealing victory in the men's slalom to spark scenes of wild celebration.
Hirscher said the lead up to the slalom had been "the toughest week in my life so far".
But while Hirscher was left to reflect on his victory, U.S. star Ted Ligety's bid to win a fourth gold at the championships was ended following an uncharacteristic error.
Ligety, who had won gold in the Super-G, super-combined and giant slalom, was the first man to achieve such a feat since Claude Killy in 1968.
I'm very happy with the bronze medal, you have to be happy when you see how tight the field is in slalom."
