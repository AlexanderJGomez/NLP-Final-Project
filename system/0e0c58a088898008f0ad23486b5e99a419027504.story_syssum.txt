U.N. Security Council members on Wednesday unanimously approved a resolution to address the "growing threat" posed by foreign terrorist fighters, a measure that U.S. President Barack Obama applauded while insisting it "must be matched and translated into action" to have any effect.
"Potential recruits must hear the words of former terrorist fighters who have seen the truth: that groups like ISIL betray Islam by killing innocent men, women and children, the majority of whom are Muslim," the President said, using his administration's favored term for ISIS.
It's been with us for years," French President Francois Hollande said at the Security Council meeting.
In fact, officials from China and Russia -- two (of the five) Security Council permanent members who often stymy U.S. efforts at the United Nations, including those related to the Middle East -- assertively staked out anti-terrorist positions on Wednesday.
The world must act, he agreed, but only with the United Nations' stamp of approval.
"The United Nations and the Security Council have to play the leading role in the global war on terrorism," the Chinese minister said.
But, as he's said many times before, American ground troops won't be part of the fight.
Ukraine: Russia's involvement in Ukraine represents "a vision of the world in which might makes right -- a world in which one nation's borders can be redrawn by another, and civilized people are not allowed to recover the remains of their loved ones because of the truth that might be revealed," Obama said, referring to efforts to recover the remains of victims of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, shot down over Ukraine in July.
"If the world acts together, we can make sure that all of our children can enjoy lives of opportunity and dignity."
"That's how we can protect this planet for our children and grandchildren."
