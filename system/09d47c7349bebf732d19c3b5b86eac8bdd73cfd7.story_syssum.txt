Merrill Newman, who returned to the United States this weekend, told the Santa Cruz Sentinel in California that he was kept in a hotel room, not a jail cell, and fed traditional Korean food during his detention.
An explanation finally came last month, when state media published and broadcast what they described as the Korean War veteran's "apology."
"After I killed so many civilians and (North Korean) soldiers and destroyed strategic objects in the DPRK during the Korean War, I committed indelible offensive acts against the DPRK government and Korean people," Newman said, according to that report.
The official said the North Koreans had told the Obama administration in a telephone call that they were releasing Newman; no explanation was offered.
