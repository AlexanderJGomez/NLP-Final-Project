(CNN) -- Several diplomatic facilities were shuttered Friday as many brace for intensified protests over the anti-Islam movie "Innocence of Muslims," as well as recently published cartoons in a French publication of a figure resembling the Prophet Mohammed.
This comes a day after about 100 small children in Karachi repeated anti-American slogans during a protest in the coastal Pakistani city, a police official said.
Since September 11, Muslims have staged a wave of protests in more than 20 countries decrying the film and the nation in which it was privately produced, the United States.
The U.S. Embassy in Jakarta, , the U.S. Consulate General in Surabaya and U.S. Consular Agency in Bali and two other facilities would all be closed Friday because of the "potential for significant demonstrations that might be held in front of these facilities."
The German embassy in Sudan's capital city Khartuom will be closed Friday as authorities anticipate protests over the cartoon published in French magazine Charlie Hebdo, state-run Ashorooq TV reported.
The report said the protest ban is "in accordance with the provisions of the state of emergency" that has been in place since the ouster January of its longtime president, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.
