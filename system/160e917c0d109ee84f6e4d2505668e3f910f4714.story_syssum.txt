But they are hard-core hackers who claim to have gained access to the world's most sensitive sites, including the Pentagon.
The three belong to what some Western experts say is a civilian cyber militia in China, launching attacks on government and private Web sites around the world.
If there is a profile of a cyber hacker, these three are straight from central casting -- young and thin, with skin pale from spending too many long nights in front of a computer.
CNN decided to withhold the address of these hackers' Web site, but Xiao Chen says it has been operating for more than three years, with 10,000 registered users.
But off-camera, in conversations over three days, he claims two of his colleagues -- not the ones with him in the room -- hacked into the Pentagon and downloaded information, although he wouldn't specify what was gleaned.
This week, the Pentagon said computer networks in the United States, Germany, Britain and France were hit last year by what they call "multiple intrusions," many of them originating from China.
U.S. officials have been cautious not to directly accuse the Chinese military or its government of hacking into its network.
But again off-camera, Xiao Chen says after the alleged Pentagon attack, his colleagues were paid by the Chinese government.
"These hacker groups in my opinion are not agents of the Chinese state," says James Mulvenon from the Center for Intelligence Research and Analysis, which works with the U.S. intelligence community.
And across China, there could be thousands just like him, all trying to prove themselves against some of the most secure Web sites in the world.
