On the one side of the federal government shutdown are the people whose job it is to run that government: the Congress and the White House.
We pay federal income tax with one solitary and bedrock expectation: We are handing our money over so that the federal government will run.
We know that we don't get to withhold those taxes just because we may dislike some of the people or programs the taxes are funding.
If we paid for a one-year membership in a health club, and the club announced that it would have to close for repairs for three months, we would expect a 25% refund.
But whoever ultimately shoulders the blame, the fact is that the people who hired them -- the American taxpayers -- are not getting what they paid for.
The government is hurting for funds -- it needs the money.
When it doesn't, the people who paid for it to do just that have a right to propose that they are owed -- for services not rendered -- their money back.
