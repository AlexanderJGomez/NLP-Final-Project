Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said Monday that the Tazreen Fashion factory in Ashulia, near the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, was no longer authorized to produce merchandise for its stores.
The toll makes it "the most deadly factory fire in the history of the apparel industry in Bangladesh," according to the International Labor Rights Forum (ILRF), a workers advocacy group.
Thousands of people from dozens of clothing factories in Ashulia took to the streets Monday to protest the way in which their colleagues died.
A period of national mourning was also held Tuesday for those killed at the factory and for the victims from a recent overpass collapse in southeastern Bangladesh.
The ILRF also said that the True Desire brand sold at the retailer Sears was among those linked to the factory.
Even as Bangladesh prepared to mourn the deaths from the weekend fire, firefighters battled a blaze at another apparel factory near Dhaka on Monday.
They said the fire began on the second floor, where a large quantity of fabric and yarn were stored, and it spread immediately to the fourth floor.
The accounts of survivors from the blaze on Saturday night underlined the panic and chaos at the scene.
After the fire, we tried to run out the door, but it was locked.
