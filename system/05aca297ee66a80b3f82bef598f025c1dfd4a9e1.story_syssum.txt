(CNN)Six weeks into the murder trial of former NFL star Aaron Hernandez, jurors in Fall River, Massachusetts, are getting more pieces of a time line leading up to the 2013 shooting death of Odin Lloyd, a semi-pro football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fianc√©e.
The video is time-stamped minutes after workers in a nearby industrial park describe hearing loud noises like fireworks -- the moment prosecutors say Lloyd was gunned down after getting out of a car driven by Hernandez.
Hernandez's lawyers then show a different part of the video time-stamped a few seconds earlier with Hernandez holding what appears to be a shiny object in one hand, suggesting it may be an iPad.
Sultan then displays a soft-pellet gun similar in shape to a Glock, suggesting it could also be the object Hernandez is holding.
University of New Hampshire law professor Michael McCann calls the Glock expert's findings powerful; yet, he thinks the defense did a solid job of raising questions about the fuzzy video.
Prosecutors could be laying the groundwork for showing more surveillance video of Hernandez -- who at the time was a star receiver for the New England Patriots -- partying with Lloyd and Hernandez's personal barber at Rumor nightclub two nights before Lloyd's death.
Akil Joseph, a longtime friend of Lloyd's who takes the stand, tells jurors he talked with Lloyd at the club and says he appeared "normal."
Despite her objections, Hernandez drives her and the friend to Hernandez's so-called "flophouse" about 20 minutes from Gillette Stadium, the Patriots' home field in Foxborough.
"He said he understood ... and he wasn't mad at me."
