While the top-ranked duo were only four shots behind co-leaders Phil Mickelson and Billy Horschel through two rounds, McIlroy had slipped a further two shots behind the clubhouse leader, Australia's Jason Day, and Woods was seven shots behind Day.
Woods, bothered by a left arm injury he sustained en route to winning The Players Championship last month, raised hopes among his fans when he struck a birdie on the first hole.
The low scores at Merion have failed to materialize, and Sergio Garcia needed 10 shots to complete the par-4 15th hole.
He was overtaken by the late groupings as Mickelson carded 70 to be one-under 209 after 54 holes.
"I've had opportunities in years past, and it has been so fun, even though it's been heart-breaking to come so close a number of times and let it slide," said the four-time major winner, who turns 43 on Sunday.
His fellow veteran Stricker matched that 70 to be tied for second alongside Ryder Cup teammate Hunter Mahan and South Africa's 2011 Masters winner Charl Schwartzel, who both shot 69.
Kim, born in South Korea but raised in San Diego, had been in a tie for third after firing four birdies in six holes but a horrendous finish -- bogey, double bogey, bogey -- meant he ended with a 71, five shots behind Mickelson.
