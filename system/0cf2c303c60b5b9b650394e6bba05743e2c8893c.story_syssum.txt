A lump formed, but the McCrackens iced it down and the swelling subsided within an hour.
But after hearing about Richardson's death, the McCrackens wondered if Morgan was really as OK as she seemed.
When they went upstairs to kiss Morgan good night, she complained of a headache.
He whisked Morgan into the operating room, pausing for a moment to tell McCracken that his daughter had the same injury as Richardson: an epidural hematoma.
"Dr. Cohen told us that if we hadn't brought her in Thursday night, she never would have woken up," McCracken says.
In most cases, it's pretty clear when someone needs medical attention after a head injury, says Greg Ayotte, a spokesperson for the Brain Injury Association of America and a cognitive rehabilitation therapist.
In the case of epidural hematomas, the injury Richardson and Morgan had, blood pools in the area between the lining of the brain and the skull.
Here, from Ayotte and other experts, is a list of what to do after someone has suffered a head injury.
If the injured person has these signs, take him or her to an emergency room, says Dr. Jam Ghajar, clinical professor of neurological surgery at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, and president of the Brain Trauma Foundation.
Any sudden change, such as Morgan's headache going from mild to severe in minutes, means the person needs medical attention.
Also, blood thinners can turn a mild bleed into a major bleed, so be especially vigilant if the injured person is taking blood thinners such as warfarin.
The American College of Surgeons has a list of certified trauma facilities; a hospital that's not a trauma center may not have a neurosurgeon on call.
Cohen's advice after a head injury: When in doubt, go.
