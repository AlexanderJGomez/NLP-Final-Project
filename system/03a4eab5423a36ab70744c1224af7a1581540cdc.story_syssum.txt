"The Seau family is currently revisiting several important family decisions and placing them on hold in order to confer with their elders," a family statement said.
While Mitchell did not identify the researchers making the requests, among the institutions the family could donate Seau's brain to is Boston University's Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy, the research center that found former Chicago Bears safety Dave Duerson suffered degenerative damage to his brain because of repeated hits.
He suffered many concussions, so there is a strong sense that it played a role," said Mitchell, who is also the chaplain for the San Diego Chargers, the team for which Seau played 13 seasons.
The NFL has repeatedly dismissed the lawsuit's allegations that the league concealed links between football and brain injuries, saying player safety is a priority.
CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, warned against drawing a conclusion in Seau's case, though he said there are striking similarities between his death and other cases involving football players.
