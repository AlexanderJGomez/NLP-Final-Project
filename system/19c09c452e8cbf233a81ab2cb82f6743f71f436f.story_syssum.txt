Editor's note: Below is an excerpt from Nancy Grace's new novel "The Eleventh Victim."
He couldn't just leave the body lying there like that.
He'd tried to go, walking back to his car in the dark twice now, but the nagging in his brain wouldn't let him leave until she was absolutely perfect.
He spotted her climbing the steep steps out of the MARTA subway station downtown.
He lowered the automatic windows so her conversation would fly out into the night and he wouldn't have to hear it.
Looking over at her as she talked, Cruise thought it was the most disgusting thing he had ever seen.
It was maddening...he couldn't bring himself to leave until everything was just right...perfect, in fact.
In fact, the dark red against the white skin created a vivid contrast that was somehow pleasing to him.
Walking back to her body, which he had spread carefully on a bed of soft grass to more suitably frame her pale limbs in a night lit only by the moon, he paused again.
It looked cheap; he was sure the gold-tone finish was turning dark at the edges of the band.
The gloss had a faint, fruity odor, foul as gasoline fumes to Cruise, and that alone made him want to retch.
As he stood there at the foot of her body, staring into her face, her own eyes stared away from him and straight up into the sky, her lips still slightly parted just as they had been in life...just as they had been at the zenith, that incredibly beautiful and intimate moment when she exhaled her last breath into the night.
He tied a single, perfect bow around her ring finger just before rigor set in...before the body went stiff and cold and hard.
The bow was perfectly symmetrical, and there, in the moonlight, it was just gorgeous.
