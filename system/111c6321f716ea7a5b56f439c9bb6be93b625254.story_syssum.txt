The 52-year-old mother of three attended her son's funeral, but she continues to ask how he's doing.
Two years after the accident, Shank and her husband, Jim, were awarded about $1 million in a lawsuit against the trucking company involved in the crash.
The family's attorney, Maurice Graham, said he informed Wal-Mart about the settlement and believed the Shanks would be allowed to keep the money.
"We assumed after three years, they [Wal-Mart] had made a decision to let Debbie Shank use this money for what it was intended to," Graham said.
... We wish it could be more flexible in Mrs. Shank's case since her circumstances are clearly extraordinary, but this is done out of fairness to all associates who contribute to, and benefit from, the plan."
He's afraid he won't be able to send their youngest son to college and pay for his and Debbie's care.
"The recovery that Debbie Shank made was recovery for future lost earnings, for her pain and suffering," Graham said.
The damage she recovered was for much more than just medical expenses."
Graham said the Shanks have exhausted all their resources and there's nothing more they can do but go on with their lives.
"We don't tell her  what's going on because it will just upset her."
