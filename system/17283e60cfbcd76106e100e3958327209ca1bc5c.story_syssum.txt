The 35-word ode to the Eastern art of meditation and stretching was the latest "Reflection from Comrade Fidel," a newspaper column dedicated to Castro's musings that has appeared regularly since he stepped down from power in 2006 due to a mystery illness.
Since his illness, Castro's "Reflection" opinion pieces often have filled whole pages in the newspaper -- not a difficult task for a world leader who in his heyday spoke for hours without notes on a variety of subjects.
"I had the privilege of observing his conduct," Castro continued in the brief column.
"The man" selling his soul for vodka was not identified, sparking a debate among Cubans, some thinking Castro meant former Russian President Boris Yeltsin, a reputed lover of the beverage.
"It may be that he is not coherent enough to write longer 'Reflections,'" said professor Jaime Suchlicki of the University of Miami.
