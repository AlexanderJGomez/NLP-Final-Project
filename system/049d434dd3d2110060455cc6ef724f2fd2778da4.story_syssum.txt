That's something scientists are pretty darn sure about, and have been for more than a decade.
At least the senators are going on record, the argument goes.
We learned that 98 senators say climate change is happening -- without blaming humans for it.
That could seem like a win for the left, at least an effort to pin down senators who don't buy the science saying humans do contribute.
These votes are more witch hunt than substance.
They're the climate scientists, who have been saying for years that the climate is changing, that human emissions of greenhouse gases are the driving cause, and that we need to act urgently to cut emissions.
Congress should debate how to respond to climate change, not its very existence.
And Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, a young mom from the Marshall Islands, in the Pacific, whose nation may be sunk by rising sea levels.
And skip the rest.
