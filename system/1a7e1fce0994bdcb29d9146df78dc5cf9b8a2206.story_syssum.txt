He also noted that an inspector general's audit that revealed high hotel bills and other wasteful spending for the $4.1 million cost of the conference found no fraud occurred.
"In hindsight, many of the expenses that were incurred at the 2010 conference should be been more closely scrutinized or not incurred at all," said Fink, a 32-year IRS veteran.
Despite the public displays of outrage by legislators, Issa and Cummings conceded that such wasteful IRS spending on conferences and travel no longer occurred due to government reforms.
Daniel Werfel, the acting IRS commissioner appointed by President Barack Obama last month to clean up the mess at the agency, said Thursday the move was a step toward firing the two employees, who have not been identified.
That didn't satisfy the legislators from either party, who questioned how IRS employees notorious for being sticklers on compliance with the law did not realize or protest the excess and waste of the conference.
Issa, a leading GOP messenger in efforts to depict the Obama administration as government gone wild, complained of a "culture without whistle blowers" in the federal government and referred specifically to the targeting scandal his panel also is investigating.
On the targeting issue, Werfel said the agency and the inspector general would soon be providing additional information on groups seeking tax-exempt status that came under extra scrutiny.
Republicans contend the targeting was political discrimination, but the report blamed poor management in dealing with unclear regulations and an increased workload rather than a political motivation.
