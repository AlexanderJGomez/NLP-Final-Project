In the first days of the newly minted 112th Congress, after the 2010 midterms gave Republicans control of the House of Representatives, the American people were clamoring for action on jobs and the economy.
Maybe for conservative Republicans but certainly not for most Americans, especially when unemployment was 9% and the economy was still reeling from the Great Recession.
The party has even printed the list on handy flash cards so that the likes of Boehner can carry them in their pockets and wave around at political events.
Economists say the actual job growth impact of the GOP agenda is next to zero -- not to mention the harm it will do to working Americans who rely on wage standards and protections, or the 10 million-plus Americans who have gained health insurance through Obamacare.
Regardless of how the midterm results panned out due to a handful of races in red and maroon-ish purple states, the fact remains that the Democratic agenda is broadly and strongly supported.
It's why many of the Republicans who won their races actually ran as rhetorical liberals, trying to mask their unpopular stances on women's issues and more.
The new Republican leadership in Congress should focus on issues such as rebuilding our crumbling bridges and other public infrastructure, or passing bipartisan immigration reform to help level wages and working standards for everyone in America.
Now that they have full power in Congress either to compromise or not with the White House, Republicans have no more excuses.
And if Republicans don't start learning how to lead in a responsible, bipartisan fashion, the American people will have no more patience.
