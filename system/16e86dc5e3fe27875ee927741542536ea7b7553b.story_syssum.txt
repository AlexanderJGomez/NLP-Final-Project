Police have more than one confession in the case and the individuals will be charged with murder, said Robert Parker, director of the Miami-Dade Police Department.
"They were expecting a residence that was not occupied, so murder or shooting someone was not their initial motive.
Police said Garcia and Taylor were awakened by noise in the living room, and that Taylor got up and locked the bedroom door, but the door was kicked in and two shots were fired, one striking him in the leg.
Garcia tried to call 911 but was unable to, and used her cell phone instead, police said.
Taylor spent four years with the Washington Redskins, but had been out with a sprained right knee.
Dubbing him "the prototype NFL free safety," the Redskins credited Taylor's team-leading tackling prowess for sending him to his first Pro Bowl after 2006.
