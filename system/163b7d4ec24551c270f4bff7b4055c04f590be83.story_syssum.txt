When they finally moved into a home of their own, they had nothing to put in it, and Taylor's girls were sleeping on the floor.
"There's no stability and there's no dignity when you live in apartments that have nothing in them," said Mark Bergel, the organization's founder.
Bergel witnessed the need firsthand 13 years ago as a volunteer distributing food to families around the city.
Today, Bergel's group operates two warehouses stocked with furniture, linens, clothing and toys, where families can pick out the items they need.
"Most people are in poverty because they were born into it," Bergel said.
In addition, the program equips new mothers with cribs, changing tables, strollers and other items to help them raise healthy children.
"I'm able to tell the hundreds of people who reach out to us for assistance each day -- and have been sleeping on the bare floor for years -- that I know how hard it is and mean it," he said.
"I want to help create the change that will enable people to rise out of poverty and enjoy the freedom and independence afforded to others," he said.
