How he ended up in this mostly Han Chinese school is the largely untold story of a grand Communist Party experiment.
For more than a decade, the Chinese government has selected tens of thousands of top minority students from Xinjiang and placed them in high schools in eastern China -- the heartland of the Han, the country's biggest ethnic group.
But he had to look up Tianjin on the Internet to find out where he was going.
In 2009, that tension boiled over with deadly ethnic riots between Han Chinese and Uyghurs that spilled out onto the streets of Urumqi.
The same could be said for any classroom in Communist China, but for the Xinjiang class, the political indoctrination appears to take on a special urgency.
What we've seen is actually students who participate and graduate at these programs tend to feel more Uyghur than they do Chinese when they come out."
At Chong Hua, minority students live together in dorm rooms, they eat in separate Halal cafeterias and often end up forming their own soccer teams.
