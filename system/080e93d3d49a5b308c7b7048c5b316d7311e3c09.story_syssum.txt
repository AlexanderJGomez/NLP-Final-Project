In an era of global austerity, this is a question that is frequently posed by policymakers and the citizens they represent.
In 2011 -- the last year we have comprehensive data for -- total development aid from rich countries stood at nearly $150 billion, according to the Investments to End Poverty report.
Perhaps even more surprising is the fact that large amounts of aid money never actually leave rich countries.
As important as these expenditures may be, they do not result in any transfer of resources to developing nations.
But it is undeniable that these schemes are at odds with the common perception of aid as financial support transferred from donor to recipient countries to fight poverty.
This lack of clarity was part of the motivation for Investments to End Poverty -- a major new report that analyzes aid in all of its complexity.
Our research found that of the $7.5 billion in aid reported as given to the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2011, more than $5 billion was not transferred to that country, and consisted instead of debt relief.
While FDI and remittances undoubtedly contribute to economic growth in developing countries, aid is the only international resource flow which can be targeted explicitly to improve the lives of the poorest people around the world.
If we want to maximize the impact and reach of international aid, we need to ensure that every dollar is spent as efficiently as possible.
