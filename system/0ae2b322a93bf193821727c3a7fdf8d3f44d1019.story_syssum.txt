(CNN)Protests are gaining steam in Baltimore after a man died from a devastating injury he allegedly suffered while in police custody.
"There is a Supreme Court case that states that if you are in a high-crime area, and you flee from the police unprovoked, the police have the legal ability to pursue you, and that's what they did," he said.
Police say they spotted Gray, gave chase, caught him, cuffed him and requested a "wagon" to transport him in less than four minutes.
Protesters want to know exactly what happened in those 30 minutes, and say it's clear police used too much force when Gray was in their custody.
Five of the six officers involved in Gray's arrest have provided statements to investigators, the Baltimore Police Department said Wednesday.
Baltimore Police officials say they're being as transparent as they can about the case while their criminal investigation is ongoing.
The police union said it's 100% behind the officers and compared protesters to a lynch mob, accusing them of calling for charges against officers without knowing the facts of the case or giving them a day in court.
Long before they took to the streets to demonstrate over Gray's death, some of them had already been at city hall, voicing their concerns over other cases.
The police union said in a statement on Wednesday that the reason for the settlements was simple: City officials believe lawsuits are too costly.
"Let us be clear, we completely disagree with this policy, as many of these cases are settled without concern for the facts but, rather, to avoid the high cost of defending a potential lawsuit.
