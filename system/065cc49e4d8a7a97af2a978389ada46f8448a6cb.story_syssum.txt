Madrid's new blue clay courts have been the talk of the tennis world for all the wrong reasons.
Let's not forget the uproar when Hawk-Eye, the electronic ball tracking system, was introduced in the 1990s.
He pioneered the first blue hard courts at his indoor event in Stuttgart -- a lead followed by the Australian and U.S.
According to Tiriac the blue clay court is made exactly the same way as the red, with bricks ground into tiny fragments and spread over the ground in two different layers.
"I never was in control of the match, I didn't know how to win a point," Nadal told reporters, before suggesting he will not show up next year unless the controversial blue clay surface is changed.
But even before his huge upset, the 25-year-old was critical of the new surface, tweeting: "The history of clay court was on red.
1 Victoria Azarenka also complained about the slide, telling reporters: "The surface is a bit slippery, but it's the same for all of us."
It looks like something Smurfs would play on," tweeted player Ivo Karlovic, in what has become a catchphrase of the tournament.
According to experts the lack of traction has nothing to do with the color but the implementation of the clay -- which has been playing much faster than usually expected on such a surface.
"It's that the amount of clay covering the surface is lesser than normal.
But the Croatian, who retired last month, didn't believe it was a safety issue.
"I would say that grass courts and even the hard courts are a lot more dangerous than clay -- any clay," Ljubicic told CNN.
I would say that the altitude in Madrid creates bigger problems to players than the color of the court."
"Players should be agreeing to the change -- there should be some value in what they say," Djokovic told reporters.
The ATP has granted permission for a one-year trial of the tournament, and says it'll be taking into account players' feedback.
