New York (CNN) -- The woman accusing former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn of sexually assaulting her insisted she was "telling the truth from my heart," in an interview broadcast Monday.
Diallo's choice to go public with her accusations in the middle of a pending criminal investigation is extremely unusual.
On May 14, Diallo accused Strauss-Kahn, 62, of assaulting and trying to rape her at Manhattan's Sofitel Hotel, where she was an employee.
This would be the first such meeting in nearly a month.
"Because of those contemptible, baseless and anonymous attacks, Ms. Diallo was forced to come forward in order to put a face to the brutal crime," Thompson said in a statement.
On July 1, a judge freed Strauss-Kahn from house arrest after prosecutors presented evidence showing that Diallo admitted she had lied about the specifics of her whereabouts after the incident and, from her past, the details of an asylum application and information she put on tax forms.
But, she insisted, Strauss-Kahn "kept pushing me back to the hallway.
She said she was "nervous" and "scared" when she eventually ran from Strauss-Kahn's hotel room, ending an incident that took about 15 minutes.
Diallo filed a libel lawsuit against the New York Post and five of its reporters after the newspaper reported that the woman accusing Strauss-Kahn was a prostitute.
"Because of him, they call me a prostitute," Diallo said in the Newsweek interview, blaming Strauss-Kahn for the accusations.
