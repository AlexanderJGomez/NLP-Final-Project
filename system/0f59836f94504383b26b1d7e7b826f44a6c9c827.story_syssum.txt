(CNN) -- It's arguably one of the largest pieces of Elvis Presley memorabilia ever: a 154.5-acre ranch in Horn Lake, Mississippi, once owned by the king of rock 'n' roll.
Presley purchased it in February 1967, three months before he married Priscilla Beaulieu, according to a Graceland spokeswoman.
McLemore said his parents bought the property in 1979 and turned it into a cattle ranch after previous owner-developers had failed to turn it into a resort.
At one time, there was a 12-foot wooden fence around the compound with a half-dozen trailers on the grounds, where members of Presley's entourage, the "Memphis Mafia" were housed.
However, he said, he doesn't have a serious buyer on the hook and has yet to receive an offer.
