According to a new study released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, norovirus sent nearly 1 million children under age five in the U.S. to the doctor or hospital in 2009 and 2010.
A little more than half of the cases are passed from person to person, and 20% are caused by contaminated food.
Infants infected with norovirus were more likely to be hospitalized and about 50% of the medical care visits from norovirus infections occurred in kids between six to 18 months.
"The shot contains a part of the norovirus' outer layer, which they hope will generate a strong immune response in those who get immunized.
Until then, the CDC recommends washing your hands regularly, cleaning any infected or contaminated surfaces and laundry and if you or anyone around you is sick, and to wait two to three days after you recover before preparing food for anyone.
