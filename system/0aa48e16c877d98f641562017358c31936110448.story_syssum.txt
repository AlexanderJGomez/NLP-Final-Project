At $1 billion, it will also be the most expensive private yacht ever built, costing more than the annual GDP of Western Sahara, the British Virgin Islands, and Micronesia.
The boat will be more than 131 feet (40 meters) longer than the world's current biggest superyacht, "Azzam," believed to be owned by the President of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh  Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
"Our client was concerned that if we built the yacht to 200 meters (656 feet), then someone would come along like Roman Abramovich when he built Eclipse at 163.5 meters (536 feet), and outdid Sheikh Maktoum's yacht, the 162-meter (531-foot) Dubai, by only 1.5 meters (5 feet)," explained Timm.
In the past two decades average superyacht sizes have more than doubled, according to Gaelle Tallarida, managing director of the Monaco Yacht Show.
"To be honest, what ordinary mortals think is 'moral,' is not actually relevant to these people," said Kampfner.
"The boat will take approximately two to three million human hours to build -- not counting all the worldwide subcontractor hours, or the ready-made items already available on the market ready to be installed on the yacht," he said.
So whether you call it confusion, or double standards, or hypocrisy, or whatever it might be -- we both abhor the lifestyles of the super rich and at the same time we are endlessly fascinated by them."
