West Pokot, Kenya (CNN) -- More than 13 years after his parents drowned in a flash flood, David Kakuko is at the Moruny River, building a bridge that might have prevented their deaths.
Parker, a Lexington, Kentucky, native who came to Kenya in 1989, has seen firsthand how flash floods -- and the threat of predators such as crocodiles and hippos -- can make rivers impassable in isolated communities.
The organization oversees the building of bridges that not only save lives but connect isolated villagers to resources that can improve their way of life.
"When it floods, people really suffer not being able to get to the clinic or the market or to their school," Parker said.
"I have built many bridges in very remote areas for the 'few and the needy' that a larger organization may not consider," he said.
To qualify for a bridge, the river in question must be considered a peril to cross.
It's "so they can take pride in their bridge, so that they feel they played a big role in it and that they have ownership," Parker said.
So people should guard and watch over it like it is their own."
And over the past 15 years, he's been robbed at gunpoint, plagued by parasites and afflicted with grave illnesses such as malaria and dengue fever.
"A bridge is a beautiful metaphor for many things.
