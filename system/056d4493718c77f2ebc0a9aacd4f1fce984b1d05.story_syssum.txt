When Barack Obama was a newbie president, there was no shortage of ambition or lack of confidence in the government he was about to lead.
The scandal at the Department of Veterans Affairs is just the latest in a slew of bureaucratic messes that strike at the core power point of the Obama presidency: Making government work.
About a year ago, after the NSA program was revealed and Democrats and libertarians started squawking, Obama seemed more than a tad defensive on government spying.
"If people can't trust not only the executive branch but also don't trust Congress ... to make sure that we're abiding by the Constitution ..." he said, "then we're going to have some problems here."
So far as I can tell, the governing style of this administration has two extremes: issues singled out for micromanagement (as in, foreign policy, from the West Wing) and issues completely delegated (as in, VA management).
The apparatus to do the nation's business in a competent way is there.
But if your presidency is based, in large part, on telling Americans that government can work for them--which it can--you need to make it work.
And if a chief executive isn't careful, it's an energy-sapping (and legacy endangering) vortex that sucks you right in.
"I can't go back to yesterday," she said, "because I was a different person then."
