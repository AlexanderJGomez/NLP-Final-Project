But while she battles for the gold, Johnson is fighting another battle: with Crohn's disease, one of the two most common inflammatory bowel diseases, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Crohn's disease is named after Dr. Burrill Crohn who, along with two colleagues, recognized and documented the symptoms in 1932.
In a healthy body, the immune system creates an infection-fighting protein called tumor necrosis factor.
Dr. Dennis Choat, a board-certified colon and rectal surgeon with the Georgia Colon and Rectal Surgical Associates, is all too familiar with the effects of Crohn's on patients.
"Because its cause is unknown, and because flare-ups happen without warning, those diagnosed with Crohn's face a life of challenges and uncertainties.
Early treatments for Crohn's disease primarily centered on steroid drugs such as prednisone, which relieved the inflammation but did little more.
Crohn's patients face another stark reality: In spite of their and their doctor's best efforts, the disease can stop responding to medication.
The two most common surgeries for Crohn's disease are bowel resection surgery, which involves removal of the deteriorated portion of intestine, and fistula repair surgery.
"It's not a matter of if we find cures; it's a matter of when, and that's determined by available funding," said Richard Geswell, president of the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America.
This allows the patient to develop an understanding of his or her individual case, and allows the foundation to have access to more patient histories for use in its research.
