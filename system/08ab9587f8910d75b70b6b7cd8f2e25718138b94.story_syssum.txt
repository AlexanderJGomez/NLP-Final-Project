Los Angeles (CNN) -- Heavy rains prompted the emergency evacuation Monday of nearly 2,000 residents of a flooding Southern California town and the temporary closure of at least two highways because of mudslides.
Mudslides forced officials to close a portion of State Route 1, also known as the Pacific Coast Highway, in Ventura County from just north of the Los Angeles County line to Oxnard, according to the California Department of Transportation.
A stretch of State Route 34 in the Oxnard area was closed because of flooding.
The precipitation is part of a massive, moisture-laden West Coast system that will continue to bring more rain and snow to the area through much of the week.
Forecasters said travel into the high country of the southern Sierra Nevada could be difficult, if not impossible.
"We're getting a couple inches an hour as of now," she said late Monday morning.
