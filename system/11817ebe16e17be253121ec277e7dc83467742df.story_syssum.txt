(CNN) -- Tom Wagner woke up Friday night and the plane cabin was dark.
Not knowing what else to do, he phoned his girlfriend and said, "Debbie, you gotta call the airlines.
And somehow when airline employees were doing their usual sweep of the plane, they missed him.
He said eventually workers opened the plane doors and, startled, asked him what he was doing in there.
We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this caused for the passenger," the carrier said Saturday in a written statement.
ExpressJet told CNN affiliate KTRK there was a post-flight cabin inspection, but the company couldn't explain how Wagner was overlooked.
