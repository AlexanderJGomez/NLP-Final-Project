I have learned to live with the loss of my son, Mohammad Salman Hamdani.
What I want is not complicated -- a recognition that, when Salman died beneath the rubble that day, he died as a first responder.
At the time of his death, he was working as a lab analyst at Rockefeller University's Howard Hughes Medical Institute, on Manhattan's Upper East Side.
If he couldn't, he planned to join the NYPD and work toward becoming a detective, using his scientific skills.
Finally, Salman went up to bed at 3 a.m. in the bedroom he shared with Zeshan.
Clearly, he did not make that decision and take that fatal detour as a lab analyst, but as the first responder he was trained to be.
Yet, at the 9/11 Memorial, his name is grouped among the miscellaneous victims, not among the first responders who sacrificed their lives, where it belongs.
Yet, sadly, he is not getting his due place in history.
