The reactors will be about a third the size of those now used in nuclear power plants, with the B&W design generating about 180 megawatts of electricity -- enough to power almost 200,000 homes.
"Restarting the nation's nuclear industry and advancing small modular reactor technologies will help create new jobs and export opportunities for American workers and businesses, and ensure we continue to take an all-of-the-above approach to American energy production," Energy Secretary Steven Chu said in a statement announcing Tuesday's decision.
The industry and the Energy Department say that would make SMRs a good choice for small utilities.
In addition, the modular design could make it more difficult to inspect and maintain key components, many of which would be located within the pressure vessel at the heart of the reactor, he said.
Genoa acknowledged that some design issues "cut both ways," and that the first companies to adopt the new technology will incur higher costs.
"It's important to understand that these designs are in the early stage -- at best 20% to 30% complete," he said.
