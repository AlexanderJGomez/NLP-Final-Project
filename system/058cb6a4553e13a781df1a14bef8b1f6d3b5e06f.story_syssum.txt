During spells with Porto, Atletico Madrid and Monaco, he's earned a reputation as one of Europe's finest strikers.
Monday was European football's "transfer deadline day," the last opportunity for the continent's top teams to sign new players.
Throw Falcao into the mix and United manager Louis van Gaal is spoiled for choice at the front of his line-up, but it's at the rear where his team is exposed.
The whole country was praying their star striker would be fit for selection, so much so that Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos even visited Falcao in hospital, but sadly it wasn't to be.
But Falcao swiftly denied sending the tweet, saying his profile had been compromised.
He's also on Instagram and if you head over there you'll find proof he's also pretty handy with a baseball bat.
"Falcao will lead Monaco to the Champions League," said Falcao's entirely impartial father when his son first signed for the French team in 2013.
The Manchester club isn't in Europe after an awful season under Alex Ferguson's successor David Moyes, who was subsequently sacked.
