But while most climate scientists I know are still sharing a period of joy following its announcement, some substantive criticisms of the agreement have also been raised.
The argument here is that the emissions cuts will not be enough to limit the global mean surface temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius, the benchmark beyond which climate change will be "dangerous," according to the nonbinding international agreement reached in Copenhagen in 2009.
Or -- or better, and -- we need Earth's climate sensitivity (how much warming we'll get for a given level of greenhouse gas increases) not to be at the high end of the range that the best current science, with its attendant uncertainties, has it.
Further, while we need goals, and 2C is an important one, we have to understand that we don't get to give up if we miss them.
The argument here is that Obama had already committed to cuts putting us along the trajectory in the agreement until 2020 (with the EPA regulation of carbon dioxide as a pollutant and the new rules on power plants) and has now just extended the same trajectory to 2025.
On the U.S. side, at least, the howls from Congress show that this argument isn't completely true.
Unfortunately, the currently available alternatives to fossil fuels are not as ready to take over our energy systems now as the CFC substitutes were ready to take over our refrigeration systems in 1987.
If the United States and China had reached an agreement now that everyone could agree was definitely enough to keep us below 2C -- despite the political challenges, the technical challenges and the possibility of a more rather than less sensitive climate -- it would have been at best highly aspirational, at worst simply unrealistic.
And it is one not despite the fact that its goals are attainable, but because of that.
