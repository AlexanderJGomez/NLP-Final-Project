Laden McDaniel, a woman who police said was among three Tensas State Bank employees taken hostage on Tuesday, died at Rapides Regional Medical Center, according to Sarah Clancy of the Alexandria, Louisiana, hospital.
Ahmed had with him a book on torture and a bag with items he could use to torture people, state police Trooper Albert Paxton said Thursday.
Ahmed entered the bank branch with a handgun around 12:30 p.m., and took the three bank employees hostage, according to officials.
Edmonson said he talked to, and prayed with, relatives of the hostages.
