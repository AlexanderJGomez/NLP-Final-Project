Third, my son was born intelligent, as a whole human being, with the ability to express and understand human emotion.
He has the right to fail and to succeed, to never go hungry, to never be homeless and to always have a community and a family.
Through me, he must learn to see all people as created equal, to never disrespect women in any way with verbal, emotional or physical abuse.
At the core, he is a good human being whose soul comes from the Creator of the Universe, and my wife and I have been chosen as the primary caretakers for this vessel of light, this small human being.
