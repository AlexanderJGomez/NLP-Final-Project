Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi said parliamentary elections would go ahead as planned Monday, and that he would not allow the military "to be pressured by any individual or entity," state media reported.
Ganzouri, who served as prime minister under President Hosni Mubarak, said he had asked for time to form a cabinet "that will be accepted by everyone."
"Gazouri's government was born dead, and he doesn't have any legitimacy on the Egyptian street," he told Al-Masriya.
The violence came as the country remains divided over the ruling military body and news that Ganzouri had regained his old role.
In all, 4,765 judges will monitor the three rounds of elections and report any violations to the Higher Committee of the Election Commission, he said.
