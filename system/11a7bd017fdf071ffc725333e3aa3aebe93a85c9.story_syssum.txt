Orta is being charged with criminal possession of an unloaded weapon because he did not have a permit to carry a concealed weapon, the source said.
Police stopped them both and recovered a gun from the girlfriend's waistband, the source said.
Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who is seen on the video choking Garner, was put on modified assignment and stripped of his badge and gun amid the investigation, the New York Police Department said.
The office declined to provide any further details on the arrest.
