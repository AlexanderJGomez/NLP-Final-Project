But due to manufacturing delays, "we think at most it will be 10 to 12 million doses less," said Dr. Anne Schuchat, CDC's director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.
"We are not cutting any corners in the safety of the production of the vaccine or the testing and oversight of the vaccine" Schuchat explained.
Georgia, for example, is going to get less than half of the amount of H1N1 vaccine that it was expecting to receive this month, state Public Health Commissioner Dr. Rhonda Medows said.
The CDC also is reporting unprecedented flu activity for this time of the year, as flu illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths continue to increase.
Health care workers, pregnant women and people with underlying illness also should be among the first to get vaccine, they say.
