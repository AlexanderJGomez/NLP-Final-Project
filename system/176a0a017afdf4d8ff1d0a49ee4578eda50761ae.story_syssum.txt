The photo, which apparently was submitted by one of the photo-sharing app's users, prompted Apple to remove the entire mobile application from its online store.
Funnymals, maker of the BeautyMeter app, which lets users upload and posts photos of people and then rank them based on "hotness," says in a statement on its Web site that it agrees with Apple's decision to yank the phone application from its online store.
But Apple, like any company or Web site that hosts user-submitted content, may be engaged an impossible task by trying to keep all offensive material from the app store.
As the quantity of new apps and updates for apps increases, it becomes all the more difficult for the company to keep up, said Dan Moren, associate editor of Macworld, a blog about all things Apple.
"It's completely out of Apple's control that someone uploaded a nude photo, and to some extent, it's out of the [app] developer's hands as well," he said.
Band leader Trent Reznor lashed out against Apple on his Web site, calling the company hypocritical and pointing out that the song in question also was available on iTunes.
Unlike Apple, which acts as a gatekeeper, Google lets developers post games and other programs to its Android app store without going through a screening process.
In a recent update to the iPhone software, Apple included controls that let users choose which types of content they would like to block from their phones.
"I think they've really cultivated that."
