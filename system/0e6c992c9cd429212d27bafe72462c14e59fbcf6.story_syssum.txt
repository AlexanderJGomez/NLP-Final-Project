The three -- Fritz Gelowicz, Martin Schneider, and Adem Yilmaz -- are charged with membership in foreign and domestic terrorist groups, preparation of explosives, plotting to murder, and plotting to commit a crime using explosives, the court said.
The fourth person, identified in German media reports as Attila Selek, is a German citizen of Turkish descent.
U.S. interests in Germany were among the targets of the plot, Michael Chertoff, who was the U.S. homeland security secretary, said at the time.
A little-known Uzbek militant group, the Islamic Jihad Union, claimed responsibility for the plot days after the arrests.
The Islamic Jihad Union was unknown until April 2004, when it conducted a series of suicide bombings in Uzbekistan, killing 47 people, according to the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, a non-profit organization funded by the Department of Homeland Security.
