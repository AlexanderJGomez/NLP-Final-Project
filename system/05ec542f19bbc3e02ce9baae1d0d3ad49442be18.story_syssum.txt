The red and black jacket, winged shoulders and all, that the late pop star wore during his zombie-ridden "Thriller" video fetched a $1.8 million bid at this weekend's Julien's auction in Beverly Hills, California, according to the auctioneer's website.
Its sale came exactly two years after the then 50-year-old Jackson was killed by a surgical anesthetic called Propofol, which a Los Angeles coroner ruled killed the singer in combination with several sedatives found in his blood.
The King of Pop's closest competition at the auction was the Beatles, which had a number of items for sale.
But oft-diminished drummer Ringo may have gotten the last laugh, with the cape he wore in the movie "Help!"
