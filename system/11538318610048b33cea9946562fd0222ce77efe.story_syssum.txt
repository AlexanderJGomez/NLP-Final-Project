Woods finished three strokes under par for the day, allowing him to leapfrog Johnson for the one-stroke win at the Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, California, according to the PGA Tour's website.
The five-time winner was one stroke behind Johnson going up the 17th, before he birdied the final two holes -- including a 16-foot putt at 17 -- to clinch the title.
Even so, the PGA Tour website noted that Woods moved up 20 spots in the Official World Golf Ranking with the win.
In October, he dropped out of the world's top 50 for the first time in 15 years.
