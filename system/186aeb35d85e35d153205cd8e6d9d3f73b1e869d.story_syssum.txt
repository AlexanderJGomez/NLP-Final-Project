Experts have varying predictions on the future of CDs and albums as we know them.
These words from well-known music artists' rights advocate, educator and industry commentator, Moses Avalon, illustrate the degree to which the music industry is in rapid change.
The company is set to launch later in September, and for the record labels involved, it offers the chance to establish a greater online presence and earn advertising income as they challenge the effects of P2P file-sharing and the proliferation of online music promotion web sites.
While most experts believe record labels and the wider music industry have a strong future, there are mixed feelings about MySpace Music as a panacea for album sales.
Long-time music industry figure Bob Lefsetz was more critical of the new venture.
Working against the record labels is a plethora of other online music promoters.
The likes of tunecore.com, rawrip.com, sellaband.com and prominent social networking sites have all offered opportunities for artists to get their name and music to a global audience.
"While you may not need a record label to get yourself out there, you still need a lot of the things that a record label has.
"It's (album sales) probably going to continue to decline, but not at the level we have seen.
The reason they are always going to be around is because there are so many CD players in everything."
Such a service has been announced by Nokia in the United Kingdom, where subscribers can get a year of unlimited access to the Nokia Music Store catalogue.
As fresh developments are realized, and the nature of music "sales" transforms, Avalon suggests the way in which we define "successful" records will need to change.
He questions whether it would be fair to celebrate artists only for their album sales when other musicians may not gain the same recognition for having 500,000 downloads from a Web site.
