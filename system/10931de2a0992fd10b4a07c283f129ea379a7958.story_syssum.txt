"As part of my ongoing recovery, last week I traveled to Belgium to seek further medical advice from a leading cardiologist," the former Arsenal trainee, who represented England at under-21 level, said in a statement released by Bolton.
"But the news I received was obviously not what I had hoped it would be and it means I am now announcing my retirement from professional football.
"I would also like to thank everyone who has supported me throughout my career, and the Bolton fans who have been incredible.
"We have spoken with Fab and he knows we will always support him in whatever he wants to do and that we will always be here for him," said Coyle, whose team begin life in the second division on Saturday after being relegated last season.
