While there have also been largely peaceful protests, authorities from Africa to the Middle East are seeing clashes in the streets -- and seeking ways to tamp down the uproar among Muslims furious over depictions of the Prophet Mohammed.
In Karachi, Pakistan, police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse protesters outside the French consulate.
At least 200 protesters were involved in the violence, which broke out after Muslim religious parties called on supporters to condemn the cartoon following afternoon prayers, said Ahmed Chinoy, chief of Karachi's Citizen Police Liaison Committee.
In Gaza, "Some 200 radical Islamists tried to storm the French cultural centre in Gaza City on Monday, shouting slogans threatening the lives of staff over Charlie Hebdo cartoons," AFP reported, adding that the protesters chanted "'Damnation upon France!'
Palestinian police arrested dozens who tried to break into the French cultural center, the report said.
News reports estimated hundreds of thousands may have taken part.
