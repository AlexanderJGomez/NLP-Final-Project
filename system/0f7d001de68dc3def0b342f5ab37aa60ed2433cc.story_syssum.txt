(CNN) -- He claimed he won the prize this week, and now it's official: Pedro Quezada of New Jersey is the winner of Saturday's $338 million Powerball jackpot, the New Jersey Lottery said Tuesday.
He had his ticket with him, and showed it to the clerk, who checked it and told him he was the winner.
"I couldn't close my eyes," the father of five said in Spanish, relying on a translator throughout the news conference.
One reporter asked whether he planned to stay in New Jersey, while others inquired whether he wanted to return to the Dominican Republic to celebrate with family and friends.
When asked if he plans to keep working, he said no, recalling long days that started at 5 in the morning.
"I don't know exactly how, but I will help those in need," he said.
The lottery is held in 42 states, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Washington.
