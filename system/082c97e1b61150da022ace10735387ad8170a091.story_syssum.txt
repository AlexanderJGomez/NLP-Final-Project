In the midst of the fight against Islamist rebels seeking to turn the clock back to the 7th century, a Kurdish region in Syria has just approved a new law ordering equality for women.
The timing of the decree is not accidental, and it is certainly brazen.
The decree was issued by the Jazira district of Syria's Hasakeh province, about 100 miles from the now-legendary town of Kobani, where armed Kurdish men and women are holding their positions, battling to prevent the ultra-radical Islamic State, also known as ISIS, from overrunning their territory.
Although women have been a part of Kurdish fighting forces since long before ISIS swept across Syria and Iraq, women have fought for full equality.
In addition, the rule establishes maternity leave for women and, importantly, it mandates that no woman be married without her own consent, and never under the age of 18.
And while ISIS labels anyone who doesn't share its radical religious interpretation as an infidel or an apostate, subject to execution, the Kurds of Jazira says their rules on full equality will apply to everyone in their ethnically-mixed district.
They help undercut the notion that women are less free under their Islamist rule and they help encourage new recruits.
There are reports of armed women stopping girls in the street, quizzing them on their knowledge of Islam and of ISIS rules.
To be sure, the Kurds don't have a perfect record on the treatment of women.
And the pressure from ISIS may just be moving them even farther along the road to equality.
