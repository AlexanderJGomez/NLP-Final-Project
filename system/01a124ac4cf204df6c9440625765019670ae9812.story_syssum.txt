Byrd, the longest-serving member of the U.S. Congress, died Monday at the age of 92.
West Virginia law says that if a Senate vacancy is created within two and a half years of the end of a term, the appointed successor will automatically serve out the remainder of the term.
"The people of West Virginia have lost a true champion, the United States Senate has lost a venerable institution, and America has lost a voice of principle and reason with the passing of Robert C. Byrd.
He had the courage to stand firm in his principles, but also the courage to change over time."
"Sen. Byrd was a fearless fighter for the constitution, his beloved state and its great people.
Senator Byrd came from humble beginnings in the southern coalfields, was raised by hard-working West Virginians, and triumphantly rose to the heights of power in America.
"Sen. Byrd combined a devotion to the U.S. Constitution with a deep learning of history to defend the interests of his state and the traditions of the Senate.
... We are glad to know that Senator Byrd and his beloved Erma are reunited.
He was a symbol of West Virginia, he was an outstanding senator, and he was extraordinary American."
There was no one who loved the institution of the Senate more, and no one who was a better student of it."
