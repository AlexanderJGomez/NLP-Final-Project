"Being in that airspace, you're really seeing the world from a perspective that only birds see.
So it's kind of this hidden airspace to the human eye, and it just immediately struck me as a really powerful visual."
The pans and its surrounding marshes and wetlands (known for their baobab trees), as well as the Okavango Delta, became Seckler's visual sandbox as he soared between photo opportunities.
Seckler took thousands of photographs of the landscape itself, but found that even with strong compositions, the pure landscapes could become harder to make sense of.
The landscapes are comprised of familiar features, but they lose a degree of definition due to their distance from the lens.
"For me it was capturing a really unique vision of our world, a beautiful landscape from a unique perspective, and framing moments that create interesting contrast between living things, whether they be animals or flora, and the earth itself."
An overarching palette also unifies the workâ€”a slightly subdued, pastoral tone achieved with slight color correction to certain frames.
Photos from Botswana are on display through March 9 at the Robin Rice Gallery in NYC.
