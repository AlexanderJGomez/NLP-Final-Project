Hernandez was a member of the Texas National Guard, officials said Thursday.
"The Texas National Guard family has lost a friend and fellow soldier and he will be missed, but more importantly the soldier's family mourns the loss of a loved one," the Guard said in a statement.
Nationwide, more than 28,000 people have died in drug violence since December 2006, when President Felipe Calderon took office and started his stepped-up campaign against organized crime.
Hernandez was standing on the street by a car when he was shot by gunmen about 1 p.m., Mexican authorities said.
