(CNN) -- A Tijuana, Mexico, police officer will appear in a U.S. federal court next week after being arrested on a charge of possession with intent to distribute almost 20 pounds of heroin and methamphetamine.
The agents dropped about 10 car lengths behind the Neon, according to the affidavit, and noticed the driver cross over the dividing line.
Raygoza-Garcia further told agents that he was going to San Bernandino to visit his dying uncle, but when asked the location, he said he didn't know, according to the affidavit.
When agents told Raygoza-Garcia that records showed he had crossed the border as a pedestrian, he "started pacing and they noticed a change in the tone of his voice," the affidavit said.
In the glove compartment, agents found a socket with a star-shaped pattern matching bolts in the rear seat area.
Raygoza-Garcia is being held without bond and faces a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence and a maximum penalty of life in prison if found guilty of possession with intent to distribute.
