Circuit Court of Appeals determined Thursday that the federal law violates the Constitution's equal protection clause, ruling in favor of widow Edith Windsor, an 83-year-old lesbian who sued the federal government for charging her more than $363,000 in estate taxes after being denied the benefit of spousal deductions.
The case centered on the money Windsor wanted back, but it raised the more looming question of whether the federal government can continue to ignore a state's recognition of her marriage and financially penalize her as a result.
Those who back striking down the law "believe this decision will give them a very strong position arguing before the U.S. Supreme Court in the future," he said.
Andrew Cuomo also weighed in on the three-judge-panel's decision, saying it "provides further momentum for national progress on this important civil rights issue."
"This is yet another example of judicial activism and elite judges imposing their views on the American people, and further demonstrates why it is imperative for the U.S. Supreme Court to (act)," Brown said.
For her part, Windsor said she wants Thursday's decision to be "part of the beginning of the end" so that married homosexual couples someday will be viewed the same as heterosexual ones in the government's eyes.
