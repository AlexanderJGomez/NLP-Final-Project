(LifeWire) -- When George Dello of San Diego was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and told he had at best five months to live, he didn't immediately begin the chemotherapy treatments his doctor recommended.
The trip offered Dello, who worked in the auto repossession business, and his wife a chance to come to terms with the diagnosis in  August 2008, and to scratch the trip to the redwood forests off his life "to do" list while he was still relatively healthy.
It's easy, experts say, for terminally ill patients and their loved ones to focus so much on their medical care and other important practical matters, including funerals and wills, that a "good" death eludes them.
As his illness progressed, Wallace, a former adjunct professor of public policy at George Mason University, put his teaching and writing skills to work by starting a blog, "Navigating Through ALS," and using it as a platform to help others suffering from the disease.
"If I had to choose between a long-term illness and an immediate death, I think I would go for a long-term illness, although it was hard on both of us," she says.
Friends and family can help tremendously simply by showing up, says Kathy Brandt, vice president of professional leadership, consumer and caregiver services for the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization.
It's all about figuring out where the person is at and meeting them where they are."
Susan Wallace says her husband had time to repair one particularly nagging rift before he died, and Dello also took opportunities to resolve disputes with friends and former co-workers.
"Whatever your religious background, it's easier for us to ignore death and pretend that it doesn't happen than to accept it as an unknown with all the other unknowns -- in this day and age there are a lot of them -- and deal with what we can and not be so spooked."
