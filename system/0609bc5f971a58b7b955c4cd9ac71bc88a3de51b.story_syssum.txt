(CNN) -- The U.S. Air Force Academy is mourning its first female graduate to be killed by enemy forces in Afghanistan or Iraq.
"Losing Lt. Schulte has been a tragedy felt by everyone here and across the Air Force," said Col. Terrence O'Shaughnessy, 613th AOC commander.
Her father told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that his daughter was a natural leader who was teaching Afghan forces how to handle military intelligence.
"And that's what we needed, a great leader of people."
