I am authorized by Mrs. Silvana Bianchi to invite you, Mr. Goldman, to spend Christmas night at her house," Tostes said, referring to Sean's maternal grandmother.
"I hope you can accept and we can talk logistics," he said, with the boy's grandmother standing next to him.
"Every day that my son is under that roof, he is being severely psychologically damaged," Goldman said.
The family argues that it would traumatize Sean to remove him from what has been his home since 2004, when his mother took him to Brazil on what she said would be a vacation.
Instead of traveling to Brasilia, where the high court is, Goldman planned to stay in Rio de Janeiro on Friday, where he is just miles from Sean.
The boy made remarks in that video that members of his mother's family suggest indicate he should stay in Brazil.
If the court does not do so, Smith said, he and Goldman hope Chief Justice Gilmar Mendes will.
Goldman described how he longed to bring his son home in time for Christmas, to play with him in the yard, to go to movies and eat popcorn.
The case has drawn attention worldwide.
