(CNN) -- Journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee told Ling's sister they were treated humanely in North Korea, and they believe they weren't sent to hard-labor camps because they have medical conditions, Lisa Ling said Friday.
Lisa Ling said that before they left the United States, the pair never intended to cross into North Korea.
They have acknowledged that they briefly did, however, and they were convicted of entering the country illegally to conduct a "smear campaign" against the reclusive Communist state.
It could only be President Clinton to secure the release of herself and Euna.
They were kept at opposite ends of the same North Korean detention facility, and though Laura Ling had two guards in her room at all times, she would sometimes go weeks without talking to anyone.
"So even communicating is a challenge because she sometimes yesterday was even having a hard time getting full sentences out, so it's a slow adjustment," Lisa Ling said.
Lee and her husband went to Laura Ling's house Thursday night for their first pizza since being released, Lisa Ling said Friday.
"I have never seen her so happy, and we all sort of remarked that it was just a beautiful thing."
"I knew in my heart that at some point, Laura and Euna would be returned back to us.
