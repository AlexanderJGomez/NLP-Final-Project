Residents from the Pavao-Pavaozinho favela took to the streets of Copacabana after a young male dancer was found dead, state-run Agencia Brasil said.
Police, backed by the Army, have stormed dozens of favelas, squeezing out drug gangs, since Rio de Janeiro launched a "pacification" program in 2008.
According to Brazilian media, shots were heard during the standoff with police on Tuesday evening.
The occupation will persist until the end of July, two months after the World Cup ends.
