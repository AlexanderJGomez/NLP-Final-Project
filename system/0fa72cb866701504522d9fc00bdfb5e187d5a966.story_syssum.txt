The pressure is on for both parties to tell two very different stories to voters with only a short time before the election.
Expect to hear Democrats complain loudly that Republicans are going to try to impeach Obama, that an attempt to sue the President is a useless partisan exercise designed to fundraise from conservatives across the country and that women should be very afraid of the Supreme Court decision on contraceptives.
The polarization merry-go-round in Washington can be very attractive for a member of Congress to fall into selling a partisan only message to their constituents.
The news has saturated America and is a common topic around dinner tables and water coolers across the country.
But they lack an overall agenda to demonstrate there is a future method toward achieving economic stability.
House Republicans finally wised up and recently offered a female agenda of their own right before the August break that would increase job training, incentivize flexible work schedules, provide tax breaks for children and families, and strengthens charter schools.
Beyond this rhetoric, there is a better opportunity for Republicans in this election cycle to sell a positive message to voters because Democrats are being forced to defend the White House and its handling of the crises at home and abroad.
Republicans can blame the President for his failure of leadership, but the bulk of their arguments must be centered on positive solutions that connect with people who are tired of the finger pointing.
