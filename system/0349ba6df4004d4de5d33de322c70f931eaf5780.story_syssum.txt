And now -- due in part to the abundance of social media and the intense interest in Spider-Man's alter ego, Peter Parker -- a firestorm has erupted, after Marvel revealed that Parker will die, and the role of Spider-Man will be taken over by his archenemy, Doctor Octopus.
All parties involved maintain that the changes are quite permanent, and next month the saga begins anew with the release of "The Superior Spider-Man" #1, with the Doc, Otto Octavius, stepping into the Spidey suit.
Dan Slott: When we first met Peter Parker, he was a teenage bespectacled nerd who resented all the other kids.
For all intents and purposes, he was the adult Peter could have become, Spider-Man's dark reflection.
Peter's final, heroic act was giving Doc all the memories and experiences that kept him on the right path.
It wasn't originally going to be in the 700th issue, but as the story grew, we realized maybe it was time to change up the makeup of Spider-Man for good, to make a permanent change.
All the things Axel poked at toughened the story up and made us look at things differently.
You find people of all stripes reacting -- people who have been reading it for 50 years and love it, and others who say they're quitting Marvel forever.
There are not a lot of storytelling opportunities in the world where you get such an immediate, visceral reaction.
I got an angry tweet saying, "I don't like seeing bad things happen to good people."
Slott: We have the most passionate fans in the world!
In the world of comics, thanks to (newspaper publisher) J. Jonah Jameson, everyone thinks he's a menace.
And going from everything I've seen on social media, I am so up for that challenge!
