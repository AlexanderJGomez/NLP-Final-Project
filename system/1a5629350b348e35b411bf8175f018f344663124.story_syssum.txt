The man who dazzled the world of golf by accumulating 14 majors by the age of 32 has now gone five seasons without a single one.
"Every year that I get a chance to compete and play in tournaments and major championships for as long as I decide to do it, every year's a big year, every year counts.
And while his game is still in good enough shape to be way out in front at the top of the world rankings, Woods says it is, inevitably, less powerful than it used to be.
"I'm still able to generate the same amount of club head speed as I did when I was younger, it's just that I can't do it every shot anymore," Woods said.
"When you look at (Michael Jordan) when he first came out, he was able to dunk over everybody, but he got beat up by the Pistons three straight playoffs, he was out and next thing you know he built up his body and developed a fadeaway," Woods said.
You evolve as you age and I think I've done that so far."
