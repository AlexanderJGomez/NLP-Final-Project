Since revealing her plans on a website and in a column this week for CNN, the Oregon woman has become the new poster child for the "death with dignity" movement, which advocates that terminally ill patients be allowed to receive medication that will let them die on their own terms.
Maynard is one of a small but growing fraternity of such people in the United States and, due to her age, one of the most unusual.
Luckily, it's very rare for young people to get a terminal illness in the first place," said Katrina Hedberg, state health officer and epidemiologist with the Oregon Public Health Division.
"Because (Maynard) is young and vibrant and articulate, she has generated a lot of attention," said George Eighmey, a board member of the Death with Dignity National Center, which advocates for physician-assisted death for terminal patients.
In recent days the center has received calls from around the country, he said, including from people with illnesses who want to move to Oregon.
Oregon public health records show the pills typically render a patient unconscious in a few minutes, with a median time of 25 minutes between ingestion and death.
When surveyed about why they wished to end their life, Oregon's terminally ill patients said they most feared losing their autonomy as their illnesses worsened.
"Having this choice at the end of my life has become incredibly important.
It has given me a sense of peace during a tumultuous time that otherwise would be dominated by fear, uncertainty and pain."
