(CNN)The story of his selfless act went viral, but for Raymond Burse it was simply second nature.
"I don't mind giving up some of what I have been able to obtain through life in order to be a small help to them in their own lives," Burse said.
Burse's actions spurred a pay-it-forward movement around the university, with an increase in small acts of kindness and donations to the school.
Burse said he has his mother and father to thank for grooming him to be both a giver and an achiever.
Although his father attended school only through the third grade and his mother the seventh, Burse was a Rhodes Scholar, a graduate of Harvard Law School and a university president by age 30.
"We would say that for every year you work at GE it is like working eight years somewhere else, just in terms of what GE required and demanded of you," said Burse.
"I did that for three to four weeks and finally I went to lunch with a couple of my friends, a couple of them Kentucky State graduates," said Burse.
"I think we are all placed on this Earth to do something, to do something good," Burse said.
