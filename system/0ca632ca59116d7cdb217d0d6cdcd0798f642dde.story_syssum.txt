In the past two months, the former vice president has become a frequent critic of the new administration in numerous national media interviews.
"The administration asserts that transferring terrorists from a detention facility on an isolated island to a prison inside the U.S. will make Americans safer.
Obama's plans to close the detention center have been met with opposition from both sides of the aisle in Congress.
Both chambers of Congress also passed similar measures that would prevent the detainees from being transferred to the United States.
And Michael Steele, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said it would be "dangerous, naive and a threat to America's national security" to put detainees on U.S. soil.

"At the end of the day, when it comes to terrorism, no detail is too small, and we must have only one priority: the safety and security of the American people," he said.
"I want to ascribe to people the best of motives, and I presume that the former vice president believes for whatever reason that force is the only thing that works," he said.
A source close to Bush said the former president was traveling at the time, en route to New Mexico, where he is the keynote speaker Thursday night at a fundraising dinner for a scholarship program for students at Artesia High School.
