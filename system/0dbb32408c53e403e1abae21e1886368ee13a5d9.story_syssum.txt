(CNN) -- The National Basketball Association fined Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers $100,000 on Wednesday for "offensive and inexcusable" comments he made during Tuesday night's game, the league said in a statement.
"My actions were out of frustration during the heat of the game, period," he said.
Kobe and everyone associated with the NBA know that insensitive or derogatory comments are not acceptable and have no place in our game or society."
"The NBA has sent a clear message to sports fans everywhere that anti-gay slurs have no place in the game," said Jarrett Barrios, president of the organization.
