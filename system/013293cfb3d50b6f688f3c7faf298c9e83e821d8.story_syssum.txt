(RollingStone.com) -- Paul Reubens is dusting off his red bow-tie once more for a film revival of his iconic character Pee-wee Herman.
As Reubens noted, news of a new Pee-wee Herman movie, and of Apatow's involvement, has been bouncing around for the better part of three years now.
The script was written by Reubens and comedian Paul Rust â€” whose writing credits also include "Arrested Development" and "Comedy Bang!
In 1991, Reubens was arrested for indecent exposure in an adult theater in Sarasota, Florida.
In 2007, the actor appeared in character at Spike TV's Guy's Choice Awards, marking Pee-wee's first public appearance since 1992; then in 2011, Reubens appeared as Pee-wee in a "Saturday Night Live" segment opposite cast member Andy Samberg.
