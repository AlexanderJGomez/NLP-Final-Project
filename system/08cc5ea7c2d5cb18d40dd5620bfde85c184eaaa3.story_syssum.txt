American Lisa Anselmo and French-American Lisa Taylor Huff say they co-founded No Love Locks because the padlocks are endangering historic landmarks and have become a threat to safety.
She and Taylor Huff say the Pont des Arts, built in the 1800s under Napoleon and damaged in a 1979 barge collision, might not survive much longer unless authorities act.
But the practice quickly got out of hand, with padlocks spreading to other bridges and reappearing as quickly as authorities removed them.
She points out that a lock is an inappropriate symbol for love in France, a country where the main annual holiday celebrates an historic assault on a prison -- the storming of the Bastille.
"Travelers want to leave their mark on Paris -- it's touching and we understand that," Anselmo says.
