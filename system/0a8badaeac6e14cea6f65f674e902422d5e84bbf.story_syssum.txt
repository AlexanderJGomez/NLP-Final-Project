(CNN)The family of James McNair, the late comedian known as "Jimmy Mack," has settled a lawsuit with Walmart over the auto accident that killed him and injured fellow comedian Tracy Morgan, McNair's family says.
The crash killed McNair and left Morgan with a severe brain injury and their colleagues with other injuries.
Pamela McNair said the family will continue carrying on James' legacy as a humanitarian, and the finances from the settlement will help.
Tracy Morgan's lawyer told CNN in November that he was still recovering from the car accident that left him with a "severe brain injury" and is fighting to return to the person he once was.
"I understand he has his own medical situation, I want the best for him, I'm praying for his recovery, but I felt that someone could have reached out to the family.
