Washington (CNN) -- With the rollout of HealthCare.gov -- the portal for enrollment in the new Obamacare health care exchanges -- getting hammered by critics and users, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta sat down with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius for an exclusive interview.
When I pressed Sebelius on this point, she said, "We moved forward because millions of people have been waiting for health care insurance," and they didn't want to delay any longer.
According to Sebelius, President Barack Obama was not aware of any significant problems until a "couple days" after the website had been launched.
I was surprised that the A-Team hadn't been assembled earlier, given the magnitude of the ACA, and the challenge of setting up the website.
And I think the answer is absolutely yes."
Finally, I asked her about the calls for her resignation.
Over the past few days, her friend, Sen. Pat Roberts, as well as 2012 Republican vice presidential candidate Rep. Paul Ryan, have raised the possibility.
