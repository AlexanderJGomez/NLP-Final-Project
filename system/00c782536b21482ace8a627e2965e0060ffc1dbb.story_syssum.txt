Well, it seems the U.S. Navy finally got the memo: DON'T USE ALL CAPS!
Back in the 1850s, the teletype machines that the military used were made up of three rows of keys -- none of them lowercase letters.
The switch will save the Navy $20 million a year.
The system won't fully be in place until next year.
