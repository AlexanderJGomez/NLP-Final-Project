Taxicab drivers clogging the streets of Europe this past week, protesting against Uber, are only part of the challenge.
This adds up to Uber being a welcome disruption, blowing competition and free market pricing into the regulated taxi industries that don't always serve the interests of consumers.
Uber puts most of the meaningful detail on what service it actually provides into its Terms & Conditions, which most people don't read when they download the app.
You are warned that you could be exposed to situations that are "potentially dangerous, offensive, harmful to minors or unsafe".
Lane Kasselman, Uber's spokesman, didn't directly address this question of liability when I asked him about it in an email, but points to company attention to passenger safety, noting Uber is "the first to ensure end-to-end insurance coverage for ridesharing."
I am sure there are fellow riders who, like me, take issue with the company not disclosing their passenger rating in the Terms & Conditions or privacy policy for the app.
When asked about this in an email, Kasselman, responded: "Uber driver partners do not have access to any personal information through the platform, including credit card data.
Drivers and riders are able to connect either by calling or texting, with the anonymization described above, in place."
But the taxi driver action also creates the perfect context for Uber to explain why shaking up the regulatory environment -- and the ensuing mess -- is a good thing for both consumer and regulator.
That suggests being more transparent, protective, inclusive and explanatory about your business and the impact of your actions on their safety, privacy and overall riding experience.
This requires Uber to develop a true brand to manage its disruption and take control of the conversation with consumers.
It must bring context to the chaos it creates and be known as a positive force for change that always acts on behalf of its consumers, not its business model.
