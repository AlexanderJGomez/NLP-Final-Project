With her campaign flagging, the founder of the Tea Party Caucus in Congress delivered a surprise body blow to the GOP front-runner, Texas Gov.
The moment came as CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer was about to turn to former Sen. Rick Santorum for his take on the controversy.
But Perry was given a chance to respond.
Adversaries of the Texas governor have said for years he is a "crony capitalist."
In her strongest indication yet she may enter the race for the GOP nomination, Palin strongly condemned Perry's actions in an interview on Fox News after the debate.
The first question of the debate came from a tea party activist who wanted to know how the candidates would change Social Security and sell the reforms to Florida's crucial senior citizen voters.
But no one's had the courage to stand up and say, 'Here is how we're going to reform it,' " Perry said.
"I think we ought to have a conversation," Perry replied.
Jon Huntsman and Santorum tried on several occasions to draw the Texas governor into their own rhetorical duels, to no avail.
It was an attempt to hit Perry on border security by resurrecting the Texas governor's controversial comment that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke would be guilty of treason if he took actions to stabilize the economy during an election cycle.
The trick for the rest of the GOP field is to convince Republican voters the race is not over yet.
