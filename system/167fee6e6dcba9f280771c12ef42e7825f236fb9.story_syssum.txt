Baras stumps for money from evangelical Christians to support Jewish settlements in the occupied territories -- land she calls biblical Israel.
Christofaro and Baras are part of a growing alliance between evangelical Christians and Israelis.
One of the most successful Jewish fundraisers, Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, raised $39 million last year from Christian Zionists to fund human services and humanitarian work in Israel and the settlements.
"There are a lot more Christian Zionists in America than Jewish Zionists," the former Democratic vice presidential candidate told the group.
She left her high-powered, high-paid job as a Wall Street lawyer and moved to Israel in 1984.
Her parents, who narrowly escaped the Holocaust, sent her to Zionist summer camps that championed the Jewish homeland.
"If we give any part of that land to the Arabs, we are looking at terrorism," she told a church audience.
"Because of this doctrine of a Jew being a Christ-killer ... so much hatred and anti-Semitism has been propagated throughout the Earth," Christofaro said.
Now such historic anti-Semitism has given way to an urgent support of Israel among some evangelicals, many of whom believe that when Jews live in all of the Holy Land -- what they call Greater Israel -- only then will Christ return and true believers be raptured up to heaven.
Baras concedes the alliance between God's Jewish and Christian warriors may seem odd to some people.
