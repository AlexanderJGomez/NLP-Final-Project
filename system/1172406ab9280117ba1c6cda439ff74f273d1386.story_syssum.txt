The bodies come from Fromelles in northern France, where thousands of British and Australian troops were killed or wounded in a single night in 1916 -- a night the Australian military still considers among the worst in its history.
The announcement comes only a week after the burial of the last British veteran of World War I still living in the United Kingdom.
As the British and the newly arrived Australians charged into battle, the Germans opened fire.
There has been speculation for decades that the Germans recovered hundreds of bodies and put them into mass graves, not forgotten, but anonymous.
The resulting graveyard will be the first new one consecrated by the commission for almost 50 years, Francis told CNN by phone.
The bodies of more than 165,000 Commonwealth soldiers killed on the Western Front during the First World War are still missing, the commission says.
