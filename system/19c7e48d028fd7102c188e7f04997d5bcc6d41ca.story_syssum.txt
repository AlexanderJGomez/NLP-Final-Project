But the outcry over Devyani Khobragade's treatment is drowning out the serious allegations of exploiting her employee, also an Indian national, and the pervasive violations against millions of other domestic workers around the world and in the homes of diplomats in America.
In reality, federal prosecutors say, the domestic worker received less than $600 a month and was forced to work far more than 40 hours a week.
In our investigations in the United States and elsewhere, Human Rights Watch has found that women who work as nannies and housekeepers, and often both, make far below the minimum wage and are often expected to work 14 to 18 hours a day.
Cut off from their family and other sources of support, many feel they have little choice but to work under slavelike conditions.
Domestic workers have even fewer options when their employers have diplomatic immunity and cannot be criminally prosecuted, regardless of how severe their crimes.
Many cases are never reported because the victims are too frightened to complain or feel they can't afford to lose the job.
The Khobragade case has raised good questions about the treatment of criminal suspects in the United States, including the use of routine strip searches.
Their treatment is just as important.
