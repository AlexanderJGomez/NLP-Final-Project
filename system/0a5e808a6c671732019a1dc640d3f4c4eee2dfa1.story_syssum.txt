Davydenko, seeded sixth, had begun the week with a thrilling three-set loss to Djokovic in round-robin play, but proceeded to rack up four straight victories, culminating in his emphatic win over fifth-ranked Del Potro.
He dropped his service in the fourth ganme of the opening set and could claim only five points on his opponent's service as the Russian eased to an early lead.
Soderling, who only came into the tournament as a late reserve for the injured Andy Roddick, and Davydenko were the surprise qualifiers from the other group, with the latter going all the way after beating the Australian, French, U.S. Open and Wimbledon champions.
Now Davydenko will eye his first grand slam title at the Australian Open in January, which will be the next major tournament test for the leading players.
