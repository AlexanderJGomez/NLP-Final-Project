It is releasing a new pair of colorful, big-screen smartphones: the 6-inch Windows Phone 9 Lumia 1520 and the lower-end 1320.
For its new smartphones, Nokia has chosen to continue its focus on the camera as the killer feature that can set its devices apart.
Six inches is a hefty size for smartphones, but Ifi Majid, Nokia's head of product marketing for North America, said the size was key because it's the largest a phone can go and still be held with one hand.
Though Microsoft has been pushing its own Surface tablets and touchscreen-ified operating system, Windows 8, it still trails far behind iOS and Android tablets.
Colorful and simple, but with an anemic selection of apps, Windows Phone 8 has struggled but slowly grown since making its debut a year ago.
There is still a market for less advanced phones that can last more than a day on a single battery charge.
Aimed at developing markets, they can also hold a charge for up to a month.
