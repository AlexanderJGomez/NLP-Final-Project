His recording studio in Atlanta is lined with plush velvet, stocked with Courvoisier and has a swing hanging from the ceiling -- a place to settle in and do his work.
But the curtain will be rising Thursday in Atlanta -- a hip-hop mecca that is home to Jermaine Dupri, Ludacris, Young Jeezy and Lil Jon -- for the first of six performances of a collaboration between Big Boi and the Atlanta Ballet: a work called "big."
As bass boomed through the ornate, faux-Egyptian halls of the Fox Theatre as a ballet dancer was hoisted in the air, the point couldn't be any clearer.
Big Boi said he had a split-second of uncertainty about a ballet project, but was intrigued by the prospect and quickly immersed himself in the work.
Stallings said the show is a dream marriage of artistic aesthetics that has been a long time coming -- and in this duality of differences, anything goes.
"Its very moving, sophisticated, elegant but at the same time it will tear your back off," Big Boi said.
The Joffrey opened the door for the ballet to use new techniques to reach those who may never have attended a ballet otherwise, said Christine Knoblauch-O'Neal, a professor of ballet and musical theater at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.
Big Boi hopes to hype the crowd by debuting his newest single, "Sir Lucious Leftfoot Saves the Day," as the last song of the night.
"You should leave with your senses so wide open that we're hoping that you experience your life a little different after it."
"If you come in there with your tie on, you might have your bow tie leaning to one side when you leave," Big Boi said, "because you're definitely going to move."
