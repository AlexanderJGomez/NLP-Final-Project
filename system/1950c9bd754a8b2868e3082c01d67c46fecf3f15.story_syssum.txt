An autopsy showed causes of 21-year-old Heather Snively's death included blunt-force trauma and "sharp-force injuries," Dr. Christopher Young said.
Medics received a call Friday from Roberts' Washington County, Oregon, home of a newborn in distress, authorities said.
Deputies returned to the home and found Snively's body in a crawl space beneath the kitchen.
"At this time, it has not been determined if [Snively] died because of head wounds she received or as a result of cutting injuries she received to her abdomen," said a Monday statement from the Washington County, Oregon, Sheriff's Office.
Heidi Kidd, Snively's mother, told CNN affiliate KPTV that her daughter met Roberts on Craigslist, a classified ads Web site, and the two were to exchange baby clothes.
Roberts' boyfriend is cooperating with police, and has not been charged in the case, authorities said.
