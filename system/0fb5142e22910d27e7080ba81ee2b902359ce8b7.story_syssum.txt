Then finally I could, but when I tried to log in, I received error messages; sometimes I even saw the dreaded twirly thing that just went 'round and 'round.
They suggested I try at off-peak hours, such as early in the morning or late at night.
Apparently those hours weren't off-peak enough, so on Saturday night I kissed my husband and daughters good night and set my alarm for 3 a.m. for a date with Healthcare.gov.
I interviewed Sen. Claude Pepper about catastrophic coverage in the late 1980s, reported on Hillary Clinton's health care plan in the 1990s and have followed every twist and turn of the health care reform debate since 2009.
In the weeks before that decision, Matt McManus, a dad in California, cried in an interview with me, worried out of his mind about what would happen if the court overturned Obamacare and his young daughter, who has a rare and devastating illness, lost her insurance.
But when the big day rolled around, after years of waiting, for many their hopes were dashed as they couldn't enroll on the site.
But Apple's glitch was fixed quickly and, even more importantly, was never a big deal in the first place -- the operating system was functional even with the glitch.
Three times, I tried to log in and failed.
This snafu is not completely without precedent either.
They fixed the problems though, and the program is now generally considered a success.
I'll be going back to Healthcare.gov every day to see how it's doing.
