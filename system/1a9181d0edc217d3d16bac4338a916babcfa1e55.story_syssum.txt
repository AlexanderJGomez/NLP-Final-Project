In an eerily similar incident in May 2004, former Springbok rugby player Rudi Visagie was awoken by his wife, who heard a car in their driveway in Nelspruit, South Africa.
When the car came to a standstill, he ran toward it -- but his daughter's room was empty.
Marle Visagie was leaving the house about 5 a.m. to drop off a birthday gift to her boyfriend; she had notified her parents about the plan two weeks prior.
Visagie was a household name and had represented South Africa in a series of international rugby games.
Pistorius, a double amputee who made history as the first Paralympic to compete in the able-bodied Olympics, is out on bail as he awaits trial on a premeditated murder charge.
Though free pending trial, the man nicknamed "the Blade Runner" has to meet various bail conditions, including giving up alcohol, his passport and can't go near an airport, a judge ruled.
He attained fame as a symbol of triumph over adversity when he competed in the London Olympics last year.
"I just want to encourage him (Pistorius) and say listen, there are a lot of people praying for you," he said.
