The news sparked concern that the incident may have been related to Iran's nuclear program, which the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a report last month could be geared to produce weapons.
Radiation expert Paddy Regan, a professor at England's University of Surrey, said the material was unlikely to present a major hazard.
Iranian news media quoted an embassy official in Moscow as saying any reports that the passenger had been arrested were false.
"These false allegations are meant to destroy relations between Iran and Russia," the official told the semi-official Iranian Students News Agency.
