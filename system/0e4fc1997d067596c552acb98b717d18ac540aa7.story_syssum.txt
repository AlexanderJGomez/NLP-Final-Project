"This magnitude 8.2 is not the large earthquake that we were expecting in this area," said Mark Simons, a geophysicist at Caltech in Pasadena, California.
This area sees frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
The country itself has seen no shortage of seismic activity in recent years.
But the area to the north and south of Tuesday's quake "did not rupture in this event," Simons said.
Given that it's an area of frequent quakes, and frequent ruptures, it may only be a matter of time.
