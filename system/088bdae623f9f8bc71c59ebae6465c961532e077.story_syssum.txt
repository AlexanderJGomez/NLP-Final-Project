Head coach of Great Britain's powerlifting squad, Vaughan-Ellis  participated in a course that's designed to boost the leadership and management skills of coaches.
In pursuit of becoming better managers and leaders, players in the business world have long turned to executive education programs.
It's becoming more clearly defined, but our vision is to establish a more development pathway for coaches," he told CNN.
But coaches also need to make sure they make the best decisions for their athletes.
In a typical meeting, coaches are given scenarios, break up into groups for discussion and then present their responses to the class.
According to Neal, that's one reason why the course has been popular.
But in return, the business school gets a unique perspective on decision making that is fed back into its executive education programs, Neal said.
She says one of the advantages of the program is that it helps coaches deal with pressure by teaching them how to cope with and embrace change.
