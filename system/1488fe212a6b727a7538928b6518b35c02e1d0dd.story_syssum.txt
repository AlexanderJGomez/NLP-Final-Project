But demand for the fishermen's catch dried up with the worldwide economic crisis and left many of these divers without a reason to go out on the water.
But thanks to a small piece of the federal stimulus recovery plan, Monk, Woodside and about 40 other fishermen will get back to work hauling in a very different catch: lost fishing nets.
The only reason the nets have remained underwater for so long, said Ginny Broadhurst, director of the Northwest Marine Conservation Initiative, is because the damage they are doing to the environment is invisible from the surface.
Divers swim close to 100 feet down to an environment that is anything but friendly.
The nets are then pulled to the boat waiting on the surface.
In just a few hours on the water, the divers can pull free about 1,000 pounds of nets.
But biologist June said the group is working on a plan that would have the nets burned, creating energy from lost fishing nets.
But, the boat captain said, recovering the fishing nets has greater meaning than just riding out a rough economy.
