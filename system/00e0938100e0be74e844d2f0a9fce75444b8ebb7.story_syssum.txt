(CNN) -- So many visitors to Turkey see little more than the beautiful but crowded Mediterranean coast or the great mosques and palaces of Istanbul.
The Dogu Expresi (Eastern Express) leaves nightly at 6 p.m. and takes just more than 24 hours to trundle from Ankara to Kars, almost 1,500 kilometers away in the remote northeast.
Tickets cost $45 in a one-berth cabin on the Ankara-Kars route.
It sometimes feels that you can't walk more than a few paces in Turkey without stubbing your toe on some millennia-old relic.
The easiest way to get there is by car, and car rental is available at all resorts and at Dalaman Airport.
Up to 400 meters deep and almost 120 kilometers across, Lake Van is a true inland sea.
More than a thousand years ago, the lake was part of the kingdom of Armenia.
Some of the most spectacular cycling country is in the Kackar mountain range and the valley of the River Coruh, where you can also go whitewater rafting.
The Coruh Valley is around 120 kilometers north of Erzurum and more than a thousand kilometers east of Istanbul.
You need at least four weeks to walk the entire 509-kilometer distance, but public transport is plentiful -- so you can walk for a week, or even just for a day or two.
Best times to go are April-May and October.
From the summit of Ararat, you can see a vast swath of Turkey and deep into Iran and Armenia.
The terrain is rugged, and climbers must contend with extremes of heat and cold -- the highest summit is snow-covered all year, and summer temperatures at the foot of the mountain can reach more than 30 C.
On board, you can expect free tea, soft drinks, water, snacks and a squirt of eau de cologne from smartly dressed stewards.
