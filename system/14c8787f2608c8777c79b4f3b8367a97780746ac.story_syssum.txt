The allegations stem from passages in Dunham's collection of personal essays, "Not That Kind of Girl," in which she describes sexually experimenting with her younger sister as a child.
Dunham, creator and star of the popular HBO show "Girls," said she was "dismayed" over the interpretation of events described in her book.
If the situations described in my book have been painful or triggering for people to read, I am sorry, as that was never my intention."
Dunham's sister, Grace Dunham, did not respond to requests for comment.
