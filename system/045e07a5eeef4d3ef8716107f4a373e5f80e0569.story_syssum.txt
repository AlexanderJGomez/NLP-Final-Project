The former rugby player was left paralyzed from the neck down by a catastrophic stroke seven years ago, and lost a High Court battle last week to gain a legal right to end his life when he chose.
His condition meant it was impossible for him to take his own life, and he wanted the legal right to have a doctor take his life without fear of prosecution.
The judges also rejected a similar challenge to the law brought by a second man suffering from locked-in syndrome, named only as Martin.
The ruling upset Nicklinson, who cried as his wife, Jane, told the waiting media that the family was "bitterly disappointed" and would file an appeal.
Judges, like politicians, are happiest when they can avoid confronting the real issues and this judgment is not an exception to the rule.
Speaking to CNN in June, Jane Nicklinson described her husband before the stroke as a man who was the "life and soul of the party," making his current severely restricted existence even harder to bear.
