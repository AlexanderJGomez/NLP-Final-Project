Anna Loginova, a 29-year-old former successful model, ran a private security firm of female bodyguards, highly trained in martial arts, demanding high prices to protect Russian billionaires.
Loginova grabbed onto the door handle as the car picked up speed and she was dragged along the street before letting go as the car sped away.
"I stepped out of my car and closed the door when I suddenly saw a young man near me.
For many Russians she was a feminine icon, bridging the glamorous world of modeling and the rough underbelly of Russian crime.
"I think she was kind and sweet, not like a terminator, not like Sigourney Weaver in 'Aliens'" said Igor Cherski from Maxim magazine "but I feel that she was not afraid of anything, there was no fear in her eyes."
