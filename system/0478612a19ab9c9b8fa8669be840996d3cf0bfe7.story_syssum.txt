(CNN) -- Condolences continued to pour in late Sunday night following the death of heavy metal rocker Ronnie James Dio, who lost his battle with stomach cancer earlier in the day.
"In addition to his powerhouse vocal ability, Ronnie was a true gentleman who always emanated great warmth and friendship to us and everyone around him," KISS said.
Motley Crue bassist Nikki Sixx, who became friends with Dio while touring Europe, said the rocker will be missed.
Dio most recently was touring with Heaven and Hell, a version of Black Sabbath renamed for legal reasons.
His 1960s rock group The Electric Elves evolved into Elf by the early 1970s, when the group played heavy blues rock.
