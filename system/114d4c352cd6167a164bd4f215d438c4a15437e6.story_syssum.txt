The lack of greenery has contributed to poor air quality and trapped heat, among a host of other environmental issues, claims architect Wassim Melki.
"We're just talking about planting small to medium-sized trees in relatively large pots and securing them to the roofs," he added.
They say that as well as making a sizable dent in the level of carbon dioxide in the air, the trees would also create a rooftop canopy, casting shadows on the streets and helping to keep the city cool.
There could also be benefits for the green fingered, says Melki, who could turn a profit growing and selling olives and citrus fruits, which thrive in Beirut's Mediterranean climate.
"Aside from the major environmental and social benefits, it would also be incredibly iconic," he says.
