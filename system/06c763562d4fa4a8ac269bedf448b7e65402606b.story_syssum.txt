Former Southampton player Lundekvam is the latest to talk candidly about footballers' vices, revealing that he and other top-flight stars made money out of betting on minor events in games such as the first throw-in or corner kick.
"For example, betting on the first throw, the first corner, who started with the ball, a yellow card or a penalty.
That is something I would never have done.
The Premier League, which recently raised $4.5 billion selling broadcasting rights in Britain, declined to comment on the matter, while the English Football Association gave no indication it would be investigating Lundekvam's claims.
The former midfielder said he was not aware of any spot-fixing when he played, but he does recall jokes being made about the subject during his time in England.
Bohinen did acknowledge that players would bet thousands of pounds on the way to matches.
They would never come out and say that, but you could sense it from the way they gambled on cards, horses and football," Bohinen said.
"The issue may be getting to admit there is a problem in the first place," said a Sporting Chance spokesperson.
"We've not had a survey or a general questionnaire about the gambling habits of the players," said Carlisle, who was part of the Burnley team which played in the Premier League in the 2009-10 season.
Carlise, who went to Sporting Chance when he battled alcoholism, would like to see the clinic given greater resources.
Carlisle refused to blame the Premier League or the FA for their response to gambling and spot-fixing, saying it is the role of the PFA to understand the needs of footballers.
It is the PFA's remit to make sure we're aware of the what the lads are going through and the problems they are facing."
