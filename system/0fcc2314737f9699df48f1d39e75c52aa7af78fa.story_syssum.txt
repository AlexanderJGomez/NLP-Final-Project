Twelve days before she was to take the stage at the Olympics, in an event that China hoped would catapult the nation to international glory, she fell while rehearsing the dance -- leaving her paralyzed from the waist down.
I was dancing on a thin layer of electrical mat, I was standing on that, and there was a platform powered by a vehicle moving underneath," Liu said from the Beijing 306 Military Hospital.
Doctors operated on her for six hours, and the hospital where she was being treated was near the Bird's Nest -- the landmark national stadium built for the Games.
"I was listening to Lisa Ono (a bossa nova singer) with the volume up to the highest on the stereo that used to be here in the corner.
She repeatedly received the annual Best Student award and went on to win gold awards in the national dancing competition in 2004, the Lotus Dancing competition and the first Asian Youth Art Festival.
"People thought that I took dancing very seriously because of my love for it, but I think it's very interesting."
Liu said she spends most of her time recovering in the hospital, exercising her legs to help develop her muscles.
She has since started to return to her normal life.
She also said she did not know about reports her family and witnesses to the accident were told not to talk about what happened afterward.
I was in the middle of an operation that lasted six hours."
