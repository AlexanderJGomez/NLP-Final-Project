We've updated our comment system to include some new features that will improve the discussion and hopefully build a greater sense of community on the site.
It's also easier to share comments on Twitter, Facebook and other social networks so you can see what your friends and followers have to say about a story.
We've found that we have users who are experts on almost every imaginable topic -- from nuclear physics to grammar to where to get the best sandwich in St. Louis on a Tuesday night.
If you have a concern that you don't want to raise publicly, feel free to e-mail me at david.williams@cnn.com, and I'll respond as soon as possible.
