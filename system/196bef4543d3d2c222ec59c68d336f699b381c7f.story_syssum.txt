Wearing government-issued socks, sandals and shackles, the 19-year-old Harris-Moore told the judge his mother hired an attorney whose name he did not know.
Typically in extradition cases, the accused makes a first appearance in the federal court closest to where he was arrested, said Emily Langlie, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Western District of Washington.
Under the federal system, the case will then go to a grand jury.
Federal prosecutors are working with other states to determine the best way to go forward in this case, but the Washington courts will get him first since he was arrested on their warrant, Langlie said.
He also was barefoot when apprehended in the Bahamas at the Romora Bay Resort and Marina by police responding to a reported sighting Sunday.
Also, 20th Century Fox has purchased the rights for a film based on his exploits.
