WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A sharply divided House of Representatives narrowly passed a White House-backed climate change bill Friday after hours of cajoling and arm-twisting by Democratic leaders among members worried about the legislation's potential economic and political fallout.
The Democrats released a 301-page amendment to the bill at 3:09 a.m. Friday, drawing protest from Republican Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio.
The leaders of the House are customarily granted unlimited speaking time, but when the Boehner's speech went more than 2Â½ hours, Democrats objected.
"The suspected cause ... is believed to be interest and inquiries regarding the expected vote on the climate bill," he wrote.
The House vote came one day after President Obama made an urgent plea for congressional approval in what could be an early make-or-break test of his young administration.
Gonzalez, who voted "yes," believes special interest groups generated many of the calls on both sides, including the late surge of negative feedback.
However, Gonzalez also said Obama tried to counter much of that pressure by personally reaching out to swing members since Thursday night.
