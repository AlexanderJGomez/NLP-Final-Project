Finally, a chance to get to know more about the superstar quarterback about whom, despite all his nationally televised on-field fireworks, so much was still shrouded in pigskin-scented mystery.
But now, after another scandal in an offseason that has been too eventful,  Manziel and fans alike may have been better off with the Private Johnny Football.
Manziel was the nation's 14th-ranked QB prospect and agrees to take a redshirt his freshman season.
December 8, 2012: Manziel becomes the first freshman to win the Heisman Trophy, after a record-breaking season during which he threw for 3,706 yards and ran for 1,410 and 21 touchdowns.
Fellow Heisman finalist Manti Te'o said the dual-threat Manziel "is a human video game."
It's relatively harmless stuff, but the "party boy" reputation soon leads to concerns and quotes like these...
Many people wonder aloud if it's OK that a college student on spring break is having a really good time.
May 17: Manziel takes batting practice with the San Diego Padres and hits a home run, of course.
The quarterback was then sent home, reportedly by Archie Manning, igniting new questions about his maturity and ability to handle the spotlight.
July 15: Two days later, Manziel pleads guilty to possessing a fake driver's license and was fined $2,000 in that 2012 bar fight case.
