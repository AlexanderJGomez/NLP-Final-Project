Through extensive studies and research, they are understanding exactly how the rogue cells differ from normal cells, and modifying treatments so they work on just the cancer cells.
Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, with 1.2 million new cases every year.
Nearly all lung cancers arise because of smoking and men have always been more affected by lung cancer than women.
It generally develops in the outermost layer of skin, so a tumor is usually clearly visible and easier to detect than most other cancers.
Skin cancer is the most diagnosed form of the disease, surpassing lung, breast, colorectal and prostate cancer.
UV radiation is particularly harmful for children and teenagers and even a short exposure can lead to skin cancer much later in life.
The malignant cells can then invade other organs where metastases (secondary lumps) may form.
Diagnosis and Treatment  Women are encouraged to check their breasts regularly for any lumps or other irregularities, such as discharge from the nipple.
Developments  Interstitial laser thermotherapy (ILT) is a relatively new minimally invasive, laser surgery procedure that reduces the possibility of complications during and after an operation.
Rates of prostate cancer vary widely across the world and are most common in Europe and the United States.
Prostate cancer is most often discovered by prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening and less commonly by physical examination through the rectum or by the appearance of symptoms.
If performed at a late stage or when the cancer has already spread, colorectal cancer is unlikely to be cured with surgery.
