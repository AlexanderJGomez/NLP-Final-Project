Promotion last season promised a bright future for the club and recent weeks have not disappointed.
Just a mention of the 1960 European Cup final will have the older supporters recollecting memories of how Real Madrid, inspired by Alfredo di Stefano and Ferenc Puskas, put the Germans to the sword that night.
Frankfurt made the perfect start when Alex Meier scored with an 18-yard drive after just 20 seconds to claim his fifth goal in as many games.
But while many expected Greuther FÃ¼rth to capitulate, it was quite the opposite as Frankfurt were forced on to the back foot for much of the contest.
Well, that would be the small question of a trip to the Allianz Arena to face Bayern Munich side which reached last season's Champions League Final and has won eight of its nine league games this season.
