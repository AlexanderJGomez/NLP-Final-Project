In "La Frondeuse," or "The Troublemaker," authors Alix Bouilhaguet and Christophe Jakubyszyn allege that Trierweiler had a longstanding relationship with Patrick Devedjian, a former minister for economic recovery and close ally of former President Nicolas Sarkozy.
Trierweiler's relationship with Devedjian crumbled after he was unable to commit further to their relationship, the book says -- paving the way for Hollande to step in.
In another extract in the book, the authors write that Trierweiler claims Sarkozy made a pass at her at a July 14 celebration in the Elys√©e Palace, while holding his ex-wife Cecilia's hand.
A friend of the couple goes even further and says in the book that Trierweiler is the "Achilles heel" of Hollande, who can "potentially create a lot of problems for him."
