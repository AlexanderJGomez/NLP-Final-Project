County administrator Brenda T. Buck is trying hard to help create eight to 10 sawmill jobs for Jefferson County.
"It has not always been this way," says Angelia Shelvy, a single mother of three who is among the unemployed.
Shelvy had a job making $10,000 a year as a teacher's assistant, but she left it to take a job paying twice as much, signing on with a union that provides workers to nuclear power plants.

They either say they are not hiring, or I'm not qualified.
Buck spends hours a day trying to help, and most of her time with the Board of Supervisors is spent debating economic development ideas.
"He works with a company that has been going into a lot of the car plants" during refittings and downsizing, Buck said.
The screeching hum of a giant saw greets visitors, and inside the warehouse are dozens of pallets of neatly stacked firewood, waiting to be loaded on 18-wheelers and distributed across the country for the coming winter.
On average, the men make about $100 day, and Paul Southerland, the company's general manager, says the noise and activity attracts others who are down on their luck.
"Mississippi is always last to feel the effects of a recession, and most of the time it is the last to pick back up," Southerland said.
He hopes to expand the business by then if the county secures an economic development grant to help him buy a bigger sawmill.
"My philosophy, when I walk through the doors in the morning, just like a sandwich: take one bite at a time."
I mean you have a double whammy.
