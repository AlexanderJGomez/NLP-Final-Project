The $165 million animated film topped the chart with $49.1 million out of 3,752 theaters — the strongest debut ever for a Walt Disney Animation production (i.e., not including Pixar titles).
The Robert Zemeckis-directed drama "Flight" soared in second place with $25 million from just 1,884 theaters, giving the $31 million Paramount film the strongest per theater average in the Top 20, with $13,275.
His last picture, "Safe House," opened in February with $40.2 million on the way to a $126.2 million finish.
That last Ben Affleck vehicle to gross $100 million was 2003′s "Daredevil," which earned $102.5 million.
Rounding out the top five was "Taken 2," which fell 22 percent in its fifth frame to $6 million and has now grossed $125.7 million in North America.
Though Fox's $45 million sequel will finish a tad below the original "Taken's" $145 million domestic finish, it has more than made up for that fact overseas, where "Taken 2" has grossed $210.8 million (the original "Taken" found $81 million internationally).
"The Man with the Iron Fists" -- $8.2 million
"Skyfall," the 23rd James Bond picture, grossed an incredible $156 million this weekend internationally, giving it a remarkable 10-day total of $287 million — by far the best ever initial numbers for the Bond franchise.
