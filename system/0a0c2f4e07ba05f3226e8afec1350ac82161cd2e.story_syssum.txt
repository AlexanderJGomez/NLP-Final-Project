WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The White House Wednesday said it was "puzzled" by a former spokesman's memoir in which he accuses the Bush administration of being mired in propaganda and political spin and at times playing loose with the truth.
"Scott, we now know, is disgruntled about his experience at the White House," Perino said.
Fox News contributor and former White House adviser Karl Rove said on that network Tuesday that the excerpts from the book he's read sound more like they were written by a "left-wing blogger" than his former colleague.
"They're saying some of the exact same things about McClellan they said about me," Richard Clarke, the former White House counterterrorism chief, told CNN.
The following year, he accused President Bush of ignoring warnings about the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington and of using the attacks to push for war with Iraq.
Rove and fellow White House advisers Elliot Abrams and I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby were accused of leaking the name of Plame -- whose husband, former U.S. ambassador Joseph Wilson, had gone public with charges the Bush administration had "twisted" facts to justify the war in Iraq.
At the time, McClellan called the three "good individuals" and said he spoke to them before telling reporters they were not involved.
McClellan wrote he didn't realize what he said was untrue until reporters began digging up details of the case almost two years later.
"And I can assure you, I will feel the same way then that I feel now, that I can say to Scott, job well done."
