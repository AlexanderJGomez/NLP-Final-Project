That's the menu on board the Murder Mystery Lunch train, a luxury rail ride around the English countryside that pitches passengers into a cloak and dagger world worthy of Agatha Christie -- but with greater quantities of champagne.
It's hard to say whether the passing commuters are doing double takes at this oddly attired throng or at the train: the magnificent Belmond British Pullman.
Mr. Gray is the first of a string of actors we meet, each stopping by like an old pal for a chat, exchanging cheeky repartee and dropping clues.
On the table, between the silverware and crystal-cut wine glasses, is a sheet of paper -- one side is printed with an incomprehensible set of clues, the other is blank for us to take notes.
The stabbed woman's cries can still be heard as a dashing young man called Matt storms into the carriage, shoves a gun in my face and shouts: "There's been a murder.
"Don't bother looking out the window, it's the same view as on the cheap train," quips the train manager as he passes through the carriage making polite conversation.
Despite what he says, it's worth taking in the view as the train rolls through the county of Kent, a rural corner southeast of London known as the garden of England because its rolling landscape of farms and coastline has long supplied some of the country's best crops.
She thinks it's Mr. Gray's daughter, he suspects the head of MI5, but each group can only nominate one suspect.
The next Murder Mystery Lunches on the British Pullman are on October 2 and November 13, departing Victoria Station at 11: 45 a.m.
