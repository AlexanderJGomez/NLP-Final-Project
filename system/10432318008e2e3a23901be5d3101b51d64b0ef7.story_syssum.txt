The Swiss Formula One team has joined forces with English football club Chelsea in an innovative marketing ploy aimed at attracting a global audience -- and boost sponsorship.
"A partnership like this between Formula One and football has never existed before in this form, yet there are numerous commonalities and possible synergies.
We share many philosophies when it comes to how the respective organizations are run, from the development of young talent to constantly striving for success.
"This partnership will benefit us both greatly, with the potential to create unique commercial opportunities," Gourlay said.
