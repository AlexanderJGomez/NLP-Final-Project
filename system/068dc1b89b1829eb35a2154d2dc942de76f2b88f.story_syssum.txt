(CNN) -- At least three tornadoes caused massive damage in Virginia and injured more than 200 people on Monday, officials said.
A third twister damaged several homes near Lawrenceville, about 70 miles south of Richmond, said Bryan Jackson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, which confirmed all three tornadoes.
Video footage from the scene showed roofs torn off homes, cars flipped over, trees snapped in two and a caved-in section of a newly constructed shopping center.
Jeff Judkins, the city's emergency management coordinator, said there also were reports of people trapped inside cars.
