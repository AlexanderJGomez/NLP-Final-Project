With memories of last year's devastating super typhoon fresh in their minds, more than 600,000 people had evacuated by Saturday morning, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council.
CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam said that the storm is actually breaking up over the land mass of the Philippines, but will continue to pour heavy rain.
That will lead to flash flooding and mudslides, even in places far away from the storm's center.
Despite the threats of danger, a CNN crew in Legazpi saw many residents who were ignoring evacuation orders and vowing to stay in their makeshift beachside homes.
One city farther south breathed a sigh of relief on Sunday.
Mayor Alfred Romualdez told CNN the city is without power but he's seen only minor damage with broken windows and trees down.
"I think that the lessons learned were very hard ones in Tacloban ... because there were so many lives lost, and I think they've really taken cognizance this time and really made an all-out effort everywhere to bring people to safety."
