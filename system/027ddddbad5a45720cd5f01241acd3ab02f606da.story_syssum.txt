One health care worker in Orlando began showing symptoms 72 hours after exposure to the MERS patient but did not meet criteria for admission and was sent home, said Dr. Antonio Crespo, an infectious disease specialist at Dr. P. Phillips Hospital, where the MERS patient is being treated.
The two health care workers are among 20 in the Orlando area who may have been exposed to the MERS patient, and they are being tested for the virus, officials said.
They were all evaluated for signs and symptoms that would be consistent for MERS.
"I think the risk is negligible to those in the waiting room or the radiology area at (Orlando Regional Medical Center)," said Dr. Kevin Sherin of the Florida Department of Health in Orange County.
"Before the patient came to the hospital, he was not having a cough," Crespo said.
The Florida patient is also a health care provider who lives and works in Saudi Arabia, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, assistant surgeon general with the U.S. Public Health Service and director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.
Although there are no recommendations to change travel plans, the signs will advise travelers to the Arabian Peninsula to avoid contact with sick people and wash their hands often.
"The reason for the signage is so that we can promptly identify potential cases so that they can be separated from other people."
Doctors said they believe the Indiana patient's quick diagnosis and care dramatically increased his chances for getting better.
Out of "an abundance of caution," the CDC has been contacting people who were passengers on the same flights as the two patients with confirmed MERS, Schuchat said.
The patient had a low-grade fever of 100.2 on Monday night but has a minimal cough, and he is "in great spirits."
