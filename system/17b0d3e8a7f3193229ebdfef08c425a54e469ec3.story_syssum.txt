What would eventually be known as "The Origin of Species" was the opening shot in a debate that hasn't ended, even 150 years later.
Dawkins argues that there is no doubt that Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection is true and, unlike some other scholars of the subject, says belief in evolution is not compatible with faith in religion.
"It's an undeniable fact that to own up to being an atheist is tantamount to introducing yourself as Mr. Hitler or Miss Beelzebub," he said.
The book went through six editions with Darwin's input and sold many copies, but it was controversial from the start.
CNN: In your TED Talk, you described American biologists as being in a "state of war" when it comes to defending evolution against its critics.
CNN: You contrast the British 10 pound note, which displays a likeness of Darwin, to the "In God We Trust" on American currency.
Dawkins: Evolution is almost universally accepted among those who understand it, almost universally rejected by those who don't.
CNN: In your 1986 book, "the Blind Watchmaker," you wrote that, "For reasons that are not entirely clear to me, Darwinism seems more in need of advocacy than similarly established truths in other branches of science."
CNN: You make the argument in the TED Talk for atheists to assert themselves boldly and overcome the cultural stigma against opposing religion.
It has since spread ideas in many fields through conferences around the world and through its web site, TED.com
