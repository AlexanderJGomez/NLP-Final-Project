Through paint and brushstroke, former President George W. Bush says he has found not only a rewarding hobby but a unique way to express himself and his impressions of 30 presidents, prime ministers and other world leaders during his time in office.
"I'm sure when they heard I was painting, (they said), 'Wow, I look forward to seeing a stick figure he painted of me.'"
The Bush Presidential Center is using these paintings to help broaden the image of Bush and is hoping to show "what it takes to be a personal diplomat," said Margaret Spellings, president of the center, emphasizing one-on-one relationships with his fellow heads of state were very important to him.
He's also earned nods from such publications as BuzzFeed and Vanity Fair that noted his counterculture hipness in painting outside of the art establishment  and taking selfies.
After reading an essay about Winston Churchill's art hobby, Bush took up painting two years ago.
"I am not a great artist," he told his daughter Jenna Bush Hager, who is a "Today" show correspondent, in the NBC interview.
Bush uses various photos to see facial expressions, clothing and other attributes that he then uses to craft his paintings.
However, his paintings first came to light after a hacker last year obtained private Bush family emails, which included photos of some of his work.
And I found it very interesting the first painting that came out was the one I painted of myself in the bathtub.
