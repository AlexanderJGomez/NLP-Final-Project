(CNN) -- My decision to join the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) in college was not part of my life plan.
My family is full of people who are intelligent, resourceful, strong and stubborn -- traits I inherited and I am certain are the reason I have been able to succeed in life and to overcome people who put obstacles in my path.
One of the most affirming moments in my life was the day I was promoted to brigadier general.
It is about realizing their dreams.
