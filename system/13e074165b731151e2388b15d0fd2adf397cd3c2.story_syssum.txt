A commenter on the PubPeer website noticed some duplication of figures (the data plots, graphics and images in a scientific paper) and apparent errors in labeling.
The study has received several comments relating to how fast it was reviewed for publication at the journal.

But, in the Cell study, Mitalipov and colleagues began with skin cells from an 8-month-old baby that had a genetic disease.
Embryonic stems research is inherently controversial because in order to use the stem cells for science, the embryo, which is a collection of cells that could develop into a fully formed human, is destroyed, even though embryos in these procedures are left over from in vitro fertilization.
