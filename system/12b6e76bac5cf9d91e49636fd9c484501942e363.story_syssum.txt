It wasn't until famed oceanographer Jacques Cousteau's 1956 documentary, "The Silent World," that people began to see what the world under the sea was really like.
Cousteau "invited people to explore along with him, and so for us it's the same thing," said Lang.
So I can put this in the water, fly it around and see what it sees."
This affordability is how Stackpole and Lang hope to bring OpenROV to the masses, turning average people into Cousteau-like undersea adventurers.
"When we first met almost three years ago ... within 10 minutes Eric told me a story about this underwater cave," Lang said.
The OpenROVs are an open-source project, meaning that anyone can hack them to create new features or uses for the devices.
"We have people from well over 50 countries in our community who can all contribute to how to make the design better and how to use it better," Stackpole said.
"If the ROV is having some sort of a problem and we can't figure out how to handle it, I can go onto the forums and post, 'Hey, this is a problem I'm having,' and as I sleep, the problem is going across Europe and people who are experts are answering it because they find it interesting.
We want to come up with new designs and revolutionize how underwater exploration is done rather than committing to one design," said Stackpole.
And our answer certainly is, 'both,' " Stackpole said.
