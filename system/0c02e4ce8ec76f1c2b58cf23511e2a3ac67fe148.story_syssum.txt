The beast was caught on camera lurking near June Emerson's 12-year-old son and three young friends as they played in the Manhattan Beach surf Friday afternoon.
Shiffman, a recognized shark expert, noted in a Facebook posting that "the tail is flat," like a dolphin, and unlike a shark.
Emerson told her son that it was a dolphin so as not to scare him away from the beach where they often swim.
When the sharks approach adulthood, they relocate to the cooler waters near San Francisco where they change their diets to mammals -- sea lions and seals, he said.
