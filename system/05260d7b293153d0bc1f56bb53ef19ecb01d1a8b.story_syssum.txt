U.S. District Judge Philip Gutierrez dismissed four of the five grounds for the lawsuit, finding that the complaint did not include enough specifics.
Kristine Rodas filed the suit against Porsche Cars North America in May, citing negligence as the cause of death of her husband and the 40-year-old "Fast and the Furious" star on November 30 in Santa Clarita, California.
According to the court documents, he and Walker first met on the race track when Rodas was driving a Porsche owned by the actor.
This contradicts the Los Angeles County coroner's report that car was speeding at more than 100 mph, and the investigations by the Los Angeles County Sherriff's Office and California Highway Patrol that focused on speed.
"Their investigation disproves in the allegations in the lawsuit," he said.
