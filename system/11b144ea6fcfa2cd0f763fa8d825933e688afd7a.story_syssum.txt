Sheridan, 48, returns to the stand Friday after testifying all day Thursday in her legal battle with Cherry and ABC over the TV killing of a character she played on the hit comedy series for five seasons.
The hit was just "a light tap on the head" intended to demonstrate "a piece of physical humor" Cherry wanted Sheridan to perform, the defense said in opening statements Wednesday.
The actress finally agreed to show jurors the hit in full force, sending a loud thump across the courtroom and turning Maloney's head.
The next day, she told show producer George Perkins she wanted a second apology and flowers from Cherry.
Cherry's defense is expected to present notes made by show writers in May 2008 that document the various scenarios they were considering then for killing off Britt.
She made it clear to jurors she was not like the character she played.
The demise of Sheridan's character was first considered at the end of the third season, which ended with Britt's head in a hangman's noose, but a senior executive decided it was too soon for her to go, Levin said.
She said Cherry even told the whole cast when they gathered to start the next season's production that "We know one character we won't be killing off is Edie Britt," because people were "up in arms" over the possibility.
ABC Entertainment is a defendant in the lawsuit because its executives allegedly failed to properly investigate Sheridan's accusation that Cherry hit her and then agreed with his decision to fire her.
Contracts introduced during Sheridan's testimony revealed that she is still getting royalties from the show, even for the last three seasons after her termination.
