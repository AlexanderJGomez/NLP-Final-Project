Fighting also engulfed Misrata, east of Tripoli, where 14 rebels were killed and 42 others wounded, according to Mohamed Ibrahim, a rebel spokesman in the city.
The rebels captured the town around 2:30 p.m., entering from all three fronts, some having captured vehicles belonging to Gadhafi forces.
Hassan Al-Jiwali, a rebel fighter from the Nafusa Mountains, said 50 of Gadhafi's men were killed and 15 were captured in the offensive.
Fighting has erupted in the western mountains in recent weeks as more than four months of battles have failed to yield a decisive victory for either side.
"These precision strikes will limit the ability of pro-Gadhafi forces to threaten Libyan civilians and significantly degrade logistical support for Gadhafi's campaign in eastern Libya," said Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard, commander of Operation Unified Protector, in a news release.
In a contentious closed-door U.N. Security Council meeting Tuesday, Russia argued that, by sending weapons, France had violated the council's resolution that authorized the use of NATO force in Libya.
