The mysterious tunnel measured more than 6 feet in height, nearly 3 feet in width and about 33 feet in length, Toronto Police Deputy Chief Mark Saunders told reporters Tuesday.
"That tells me that this was nailed inside the tunnel on the wall," Saunders deadpanned as the room erupted with laughter.
"I wasn't overly concerned that 'Oh my goodness this is going to be something horrific,' " said Saunders, a 31-year veteran overseeing security of the world's third largest international multi-sport games.
Saunders said the tunnel found about 82 feet west of a fence that separated a densely wooded area from tennis courts at Rexall Centre, a tennis and entertainment complex on the grounds of York University.
Ice that formed at the end of a hose attached to the sump pump indicates that the tunnel may have been used this winter.
Police also found a gas can, food and beverage containers, work gloves, a wheel barrow and moisture-resistant light bulbs in the tunnel, which has been filled in.
It is the third largest international sports competition after the Olympic Summer Games and the Asian Games.
