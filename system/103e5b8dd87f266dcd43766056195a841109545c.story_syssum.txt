The girl was caught in the early hours of December 23 at a staircase -- known as the "Lennon Wall" -- leading to the Central Government Offices in the city's Admiralty district and was detained by police for 17 hours.
A spokesperson from the Social Welfare Department told CNN that all court cases in Hong Kong are open, however a court can decide not to disclose information in cases where the identity of a minor needs to be protected.
Protesters started placing notes on the wall as a show of defiance after police used tear gas on demonstrators at the start of the protest, which led to a two-month occupation of the main road outside the Central Government Office.
The boy was arrested during the police clear out of the Mong Kok protest site last year.
Thirty protest leaders, including the three founders of Occupy Central with Love and Peace and several prominent student leaders, have been called by the police to report to the police headquarters in Wan Chai district, where they could possibly be arrested and prosecuted for their involvement with the two-month long protest.
