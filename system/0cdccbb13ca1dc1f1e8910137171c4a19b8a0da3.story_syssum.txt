Diego Leon Montoya Sanchez, now 47 the FBI says, was taken into custody early Monday, Minister of Defense Juan Manuel Santos told reporters.
Plans revved up three days ago, when informants told authorities that Montoya was in the town of Salsa in the department of El Valle, he said.
On Sunday, intelligence narrowed his whereabouts to the Hacienda Pital, said Gen. Mario Montoya Uribe.
They also found his wallet and cell phone, but Montoya Sanchez was nowhere to be found, the general said.
Since taking office in 2002, President Alvaro Uribe, a key U.S. ally in Latin America, has approved the extradition of nearly 500 Colombians to the United States, the majority on drug-trafficking charges, according to The Associated Press.
For his aggressive stance, the United States has awarded Colombia with more than $700 million in annual anti-narcotic aid.
