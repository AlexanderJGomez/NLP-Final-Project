There's something about how movies, with their singularity of mood and density of detail, imprint themselves on our imaginations that places the prospect of a remake somewhere between a rock and a hard place.
People might as well just watch the great version they already know (or, for new generations, have yet to discover).
There's nothing that compares to its glittery fusion of dreaminess and dread â€” of Cinderella-at-the-prom fantasy and blood-bucket horror, all mixed up with elements of '70s teensploitation comedy and primally entangled mother-daughter tragedy.
Kimberly Peirce, the gifted director of the new Carrie, has gone down what seems, on the surface, to be a savvy road.
In a neat reversal, Chris and her best friend, the popular but far more empathetic Sue (who feels so guilty about what happened that she gets her boyfriend to take Carrie to the prom), are both portrayed against type: Nice-girl Sue is played by Gabriella Wilde, who looks like a vintage snooty princess, whereas the awful Chris is made into a pensive bohemian punk by Portia Doubleday.
When you take away that style and serve up the plot fairly straight, as Peirce does here, we seem to be watching a Carrie that's been flattened, robbed of its over-the-top emotional extravagance.
In stiff hair and lumpish clothing, she's very much the geek outsider (though today there's a much greater context for geeks as heroines), and the emotions seem to bleed through her ghostly, lunar-pale skin.
And it's here that the real problem with redoing a classic reveals itself.
But now we're a lot more accustomed to seeing movie characters mold their destiny through special effects, and since Peirce films the climax in a rather depersonalized, shoot-the-works way, Carrie comes close to seeming like an especially alienated member of the X-Men team.
