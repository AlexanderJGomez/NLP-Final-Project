Jon Corzine the day before commuted the sentences of eight men sitting on the state's death row.
"Megan's Law," introduced after her death, requires that authorities notify neighbors when a sex offender moves into an area.
"It's a day of progress for the state of New Jersey and for the millions of people across our nation and around the globe who reject the death penalty as a moral or practical response to the grievous, even heinous, crime of murder," Corzine said.
The bill was introduced in November after a state commission concluded capital punishment was an ineffective deterrent to crime.
According to the Death Penalty Information Center, which opposes capital punishment, New Jersey joins 13 states and the District of Columbia that do not use execution as a means of punishment.
