"While the crime scene processing was under way in that room, we found some notes and some writings that indicated that this was a planned attack," UCF Police Chief Richard Beary told reporters.
Seevakumaran developed an outline for the attack, but that never came to fruition, thanks in part to the rapid response of law enforcement, Beary said.
Federal agents have joined the investigation, and the bombs were sent to an FBI lab to determine what materials were used.
Beary said police are still investigating to find out "what made him tick," but early indications were that Seevakumaran had very few friends and had anger issues.
"The way they handled it was disappointing because it started as a fire alarm," said dorm resident Antionette Thompson.
Thompson was among five dorm evacuees sitting together on a campus bench, some of them bundled up in a blanket, others still dressed in their pajamas.
Firearms are prohibited at UCF, which is home to about 59,000 students at its main Orlando campus and 10 regional facilities.
