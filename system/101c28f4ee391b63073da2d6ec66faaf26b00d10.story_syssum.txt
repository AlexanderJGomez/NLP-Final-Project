Those people who are up-in-arms that Woods has climbed back to his standing as the world's No.
But I never thought it was Tiger's job to teach my son how to be a responsible, loving husband or father.

No, sadly, it was the winning and the big money that kept Paterno and others safe.
For me, nothing is better than someone who can get back up and succeed after a bloody knockout.
