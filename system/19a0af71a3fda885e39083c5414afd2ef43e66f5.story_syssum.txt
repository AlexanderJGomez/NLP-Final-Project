(CNN) -- Hundred's of fans and former teammates of Robert Enke gathered to lay flowers and light candles outside of Hannover 96's Niedersachsen Stadion after the club's German goalkeeper was struck and killed by a train on Tuesday, in what police called an apparent suicide.
Enke captained Hannover 96, a team who currently lie tenth in Germany's Bundesliga top division,  and had been capped by his national side eight times after making his debut aged 29.
Enke had missed Germany's last four matches because of a bacterial infection, but had recently returned to action with Hannover.
"The leadership of the German national team never had any doubt that he was important for the team both as a goalkeeper and as a human being," the DFB statement said.
Fellow players said they believed that Enke had been suffering depression.
The coach of Germany's national team, Joachim Lowe, had been preparing his squad for their friendly game against Chile this weekend.
