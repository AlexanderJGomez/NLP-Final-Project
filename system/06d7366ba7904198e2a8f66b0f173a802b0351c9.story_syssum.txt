(CNN) -- Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris was rebounding Saturday after hundreds of flights were canceled because of a shortage of de-icing fluid during snow and ice that snarled air traffic across Europe, authorities said.
Some passengers and others were critical of what happened at de Gaulle, but officials blamed the situation largely on the weather.
Gatwick Airport and Heathrow Airports in London said airlines were operating, but some delays or cancellations were possible.
French authorities earlier Friday asked airlines to cancel half their morning flights to and from the airport because the de-icing fluid was running low.
Charles de Gaulle is the second busiest airport in Europe, after Heathrow in London.
