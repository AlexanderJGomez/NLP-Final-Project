Through a local newspaper column and his nonprofit, The Time Is Now To Help, Dimiceli assists about 500 people a year with food, rent, utilities and other necessities.
I want to cry thinking that CNN and people recognize the poverty that is out there so we can help even more people.
I thank God and CNN for telling the world: "Yes, something can be done.
By showing how we are coming together, networking with people to find solutions for helping them, I pray that other areas around the U.S. will come together with their local people to make a difference.
CNN is my hero for taking all of us to the forefront, recognizing that we are making a big difference in the world around us.
Every penny is going to help our fellow creations in dire need, and I'm going to do it as expeditiously as I can.
Dimiceli: Everything that I did to help others would not be possible if it wasn't for my mother.
I'm 60 now, and I'm going to keep that promise for as long as I can breathe.
