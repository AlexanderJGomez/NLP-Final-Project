The string octet, which is supporting the band for the entirety of the tour, is a smart addition to Death Cab's rich melodic sound, especially since they're sampling only lightly from their most recent album, "Codes and Keys," in favor of a more buffet-like approach to their indie-to-major catalog.
The seated, sold-out crowd was dotted with more tweens and retirees than your average club show, and the band leaned more toward buttoned-down professionalism than rock & roll abandon, affecting a sort of politely feverish "Ed Sullivan Show" image with their tight mannerisms and colorful stage lighting.
Back up went the teenagers and the tipsy, 30-something fan boys and girls, who were right to stay on their feet as Gibbard ended the main set a song later with the buoyant "Codes and Keys" closer, "Stay Young, Go Dancing."
An unusually vulnerable "I Will Follow You Into the Dark" highlighted the six-song appendage, contrasted by another one of the night's few moments of abandon, a cacophonous "Transatlanticism" that gave the sleepy show the slap it needed to continue on for another 20-plus dates.
