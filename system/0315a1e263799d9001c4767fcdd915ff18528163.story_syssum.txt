After working with thousands of men all around the world, I have found that the common issue holding men back with women is that "thing" on top of their shoulders.
Just because a woman is hot does not mean that her life is perfect.
It's simply one thing about a woman that she literally wears on her sleeve.
But after that, something interesting happens: A man's face shifts according to how he makes a woman feel.
Women do not sit around with their girlfriends and say "Oh, Marni, I can't wait to meet a lazy, unreliable jerk who treats me poorly and feeds on my insecurities."
Women want to be approached, as long as it's by the right person.
If you see a girl you like, stop, breathe and think to yourself, "She's adorable.
Yes, they're hot, yes other men may want them, but that does not mean that all self-respect gets thrown out the door.
Sitting on your couch watching "Law & Order" is not going to bring you results with women.
