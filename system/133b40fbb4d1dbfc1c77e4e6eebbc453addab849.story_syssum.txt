The rebels have agreed to release the President's chief of staff and withdraw their militias from key government institutions if officials take a significant step: rewriting parts of the country's constitution, according to a Yemeni official with access to a draft text of the peace deal.
Houthi rebels -- Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- abducted the President's chief of staff over the weekend, then took over the presidential palace in Sanaa on Tuesday.
And questions over who's in charge over the past few days have sparked concerns that a power vacuum could help terrorist groups get a stronger foothold.
Several of the constitutional changes sought by the Houthis would emphasize the characteristics of Yemen as a federal state and push for more inclusion of diverse groups.
The rebels would cooperate with the government so that the President and state institutions can return to their duties and would urge all state employees to return to their jobs.
In the past, timelines were not respected, who hope this time will be different," a member of the Houthi Political council said.
In September, they signed a ceasefire deal with the government, and Houthis have since installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions.
Two Houthi field commanders told CNN that rebels had seized control of a massive weapons depot belonging to the government brigade that provides presidential personal security.
The installation is not under control of the rebels, but they have it surrounded, the field commanders and two government officials said.
