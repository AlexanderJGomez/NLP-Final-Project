(CNN) -- A 17-year-old boy appeared in a California juvenile court on Tuesday in connection with a small fire that occurred during several wildfires last week in San Diego County, authorities said.
Serrato is the only person charged with arson in last week's wildfires, which at one point numbered about three dozen.
The Pulgas Fire on the Marine Corps base Camp Pendleton burned 14,416 acres and was 99% contained Tuesday afternoon, Cal Fire said.
The two fires and others on Camp Pendleton last week burned 21,900 acres, almost 18% of the base, the Marines said.
