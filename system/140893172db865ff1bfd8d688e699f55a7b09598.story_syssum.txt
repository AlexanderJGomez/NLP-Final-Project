When I took the subway home on Monday night, after watching news that three people died and more than 100 were injured in a terror attack in Boston, I looked around at crowds and fellow passengers in Atlanta with an unfair twinge of suspicion.
And just when it seemed like "terror" was a word that we could use with a sense of distance and irony -- and a concept we watched play out in films like "Zero Dark Thirty" and not in our communities -- our collective sense of security threatened to evaporate again, after two explosions hit the finish line of the Boston Marathon.
"I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say 'Look for the helpers.
They were marathoners who "kept running, all the way to Massachusetts General Hospital, to give blood" after the blasts went off.
Unsure of whether there would be another explosion, these strangers risked their lives to help other strangers, performing CPR, comforting those in shock, and carrying the wounded to the nearby medical tent."
"I saw at least six to seven people down next to me," he said.
Outside that northeastern city, they were technologists who scrambled to publish tools to help relatives find their loved ones and to help stranded visitors find a safe place to stay the night.
And in the hours that followed police and medical personnel from across the region have sent dozens, maybe even hundreds, of volunteers to help us here in Boston.
It was true in Norway, where people responded to a 2011 massacre by gathering around an Oslo courthouse to sing.
But as the "helpers" in the wake of the Boston bombing reminded me, we are more the same than different, and more good than evil.
