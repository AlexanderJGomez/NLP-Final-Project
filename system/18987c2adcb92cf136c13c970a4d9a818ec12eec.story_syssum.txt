Prolific television producer Glen A. Larson passed away on Friday at the age of 77 after a battle with cancer, his son James told CNN.
Larson loved action and science fiction, and "Battlestar Galactica" was a concept he considered for about 10 years before it finally hit the air in 1978.
Actor Edward James Olmos, who played Commander Adama in the new series, also paid his respects: "Glen Larson, we thank you for the ride, you are battlestar, we will miss you.
Without him there'd be no KITT & Michael."
