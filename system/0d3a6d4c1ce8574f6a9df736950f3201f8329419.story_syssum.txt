Chaifetz posted the recording online Monday, which has since led to disciplinary actions, including the removal of at least one teacher, school officials said.
"I want to assure our parents that the individuals who are heard on the recording raising their voices and inappropriately addressing children no longer work in the district and have not since shortly after we received the copy of the recording," she said.
Chaifetz -- who said he didn't think the disciplinary action went far enough -- posted a video on YouTube of himself denouncing the incident, interspersed with the recordings.
Chaifetz says he wants an apology from the teachers and claims one of them apparently has been transferred to a local high school in the same district.
