As these rivers of ice retreat back up the valleys they carved out, so scientists' knowledge of climate change advances, in turn helping us recognize the signs of a warming world.
Kaspar Meuli, Head of Communications at the Oeschger Center, told CNN what people can expect from the device.
The Jungfrau region is home to the upper and lower Grindelwald glaciers, which have retreated rapidly in recent years.
In the future, Meuli says the University hopes to produce features that can be used by teachers in preparation for taking classes to the glaciers.
