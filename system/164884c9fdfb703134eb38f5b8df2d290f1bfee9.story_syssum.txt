He came into the race a complete underdog, according to some NASCAR writers, and even into the last lap, it was anyone's guess who would take the checkered flag.
Bayne, less than a full day into his historic win in NASCAR's most prestigious race, has been thrust into sudden fame.
In only his second Sprint Cup race, the young driver spoke reverently of veteran drivers on the track who "took that leap of faith seeing our yellow rookie stripes on the back bumper, and still worked with us anyway."
He is also active in Back2Back Ministries, a Christian organization that works with orphaned children and needy people in Mexico, Nigeria and India.
He said Bayne is expected to get about one-third of that.
