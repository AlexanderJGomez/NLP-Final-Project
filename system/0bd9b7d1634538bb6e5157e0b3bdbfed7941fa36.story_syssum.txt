George Zinkhan, 57, is suspected of fatally shooting his wife and two other people last month outside a community theater in Athens, which is home to the University of Georgia.
The body was found "beneath the earth," Lumpkin said, without any clothes.
The victims all were associated with the Town and Gown Players, a theater group that was holding a reunion picnic at the time of the shootings.
Authorities put out bulletins across the nation for Zinkhan after the shootings and revealed that he had purchased a May 2 ticket in March to the Netherlands, where he owns a house.
