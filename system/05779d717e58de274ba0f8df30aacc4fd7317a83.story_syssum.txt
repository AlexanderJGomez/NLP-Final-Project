Merian C. Cooper's 1933 classic fantasy tale of a giant gorilla has become a musical reality at the Regent Theatre, in Melbourne, Australia -- thanks to a six-meter high robotic puppet, and the pioneering work of puppeteer Sonny Tilders.
The animatronics expert leads a 35-strong team at The Creature Technology Company in west Melbourne and has an impressive track record in both film and theater.
When the multi-million dollar project started five years ago, Tilders originally set out to create a fully animatronic creature but ended up combining old-fashioned puppetry with modern robotics.
Clad in black from head to toe, these shadowy figures called the "King's Men," work in tandem with three off-stage puppeteers -- the "voodoo" operators -- who control the mechanical functions inside Kong.
Around 300 meters of electrical wiring are crammed inside the puppet's steel and aluminum shell powering 16 microprocessors and 15 servo motors which move Kong's eyes, eyebrows and eyelids, nose, lips, jaw, neck and shoulders.
Overlaying the air bags are a series of sculptured muscle bags made from a stretchy nylon material that expands and contracts to mimic the sinewy movements of the real thing.
But the complexity of Kong surpassed anything they have previously built, leading to a few nerves as opening night approached.
I think you have to see inferior robotic incarnations to see quite how clever (Kong) is."
It's only a matter of time before audiences worldwide get their chance to feel the towering stage presence of Kong, said Tilders.
Obviously, we would love to go to Broadway because that's the natural home for the story."
