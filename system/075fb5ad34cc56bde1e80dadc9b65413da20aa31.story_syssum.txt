"I just saw an opportunity -- my mom is going through a divorce and I don't need this last name anymore," explained 30-year old entrepreneur Jason Sadler, who lives in Jacksonville, Florida.
Sadler says he wants to reinvest the money he makes into other "fun marketing things" and "give 10% of it to charity."
This is not Sadler's first attempt at a more creative -- if unorthodox -- moneymaking scheme.
I live in this kind of online marketing world and I'm very passionate about it.
There's been a lot of talk on the internet about giving me a dumb last name.
I have the last right of refusal."
