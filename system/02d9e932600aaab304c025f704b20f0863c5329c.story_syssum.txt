They are shocked and scared by the news headlines: some food produced in China is tainted with melamine.
"We will use our actions and high quality of our food products to win the trust and confidence of Chinese people and people around the world," he told reporters at the end of a two-day summit of Asian and European leaders in Beijing last weekend.
The state-run Nanfang Daily published an investigative story saying that adding melamine into animal feed has become an "open secret."
Even more shocking is the allegation that the melamine added is from industrial waste material.
Tests in Hong Kong last week showed eggs exported by a Chinese company are contaminated with excessive levels of melamine.
Small wonder egg sales at the Xinfadi, a wholesale market in Beijing, dropped by 10 percent this week, according to the state-run China Daily.
Ingesting melamine in large doses over an extended period of time could cause kidney stones and other illnesses, agriculture and health experts say.
Until the situation is resolved, worried grocery shoppers in Beijing say they'll just have to eat fewer eggs and more bean-products, like soybeans.
