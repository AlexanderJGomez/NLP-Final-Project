President Obama's decision to target militants from ISIS -- which is now calling itself the "Islamic State" or "IS" -- operating in Iraq comes as a huge relief to the Iranians.
The hawks in Tehran, however, remain reluctant to publicly admit to any shared interests with Washington.
On Monday, the moderate faction of President Rouhani took a step to formally spell out its backing for American airstrikes.
And given his stature inside the Iranian system his words must be seen as a peek into the internal policy debate in Tehran about the situation in Iraq and Iran's options.
They are also in agreement that Iraq above all needs a new political leadership and that Prime Minister Maliki has to go.
The Americans were quicker to recognize Maliki to be at the heart of Iraq's malaise but the Iranians have finally come around to the same conclusion.
And Maliki's woeful management of the Iraqi military's response to the newly declared "Islamic State" made the Iranians just wonder what he was good for.
As far as the U.S. role in combating the Islamic State is concerned, the Iranian debate is likely to remain split between the moderates and the hawks.
But all the recent trends suggest that the moderate viewpoint in Tehran has the upper hand on the policy question of Iraq and how Iran can best serve its interests.
