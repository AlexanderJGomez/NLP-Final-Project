The legislation was spearheaded by Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, whose own piloting incident led to increased scrutiny by the Federal Aviation Administration.
Supporters of the "Pilot's Bill of Rights" say the new measure passed by the House and Senate gives general aviation pilots the ability to fight charges levied against them by FAA officials.
Pilots have argued that current FAA medical forms are easily misunderstood, resulting in those who are under investigation being accused of falsifying the documents.
"This is a landmark bill for general aviation, and protecting GA pilots' freedom to fly," said Lorraine Howerton, Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association vice president of legislative affairs, said on the AOPA's website.
