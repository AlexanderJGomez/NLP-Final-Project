Those are two reasons, the Food and Drug Administration says, why it has launched a national education campaign aimed at preventing those between the ages of 12 and 17 from trying cigarettes or -- for those already experimenting -- from becoming regular smokers.
About nine of 10 regular smokers had their first cigarettes by the time they were 18, said FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg.
These new ads are the first of several planned education campaigns, but it's not the only effort.
RJ Reynolds, the second-largest tobacco company in the U.S., runs a youth tobacco prevention program called Right Decisions Right Now: Be Tobacco Free.
"Over the past 20 years, youth tobacco prevention efforts and programs have had a big impact on reducing teen smoking, now at a historic low, and we are actively working on ways to accelerate the decline in youth tobacco use."
"We will make an important contribution to reducing the toll of preventable death, disease and disability from cigarettes and tobacco use.
It costs the health care system over $289 billion and also lost productivity costs, according to a recent estimate.
So if we can reach them and stop them, we can prevent a life-long addiction and all of the concomitant disability and disease and early death."
