(EW.com) -- There are few better ways for an actor to show off his chops than by playing the clever trickster in a thriller (think of Daniel Craig's 007 at the poker table, or Matt Damon's Bourne leading his CIA overseers through the looking glass).
Only then do we learn that Frost is a rogue agent who ditched the CIA and has spent nine years trading secrets with America's enemies.
When thugs enter, yet somehow fail to find Frost tethered to a chair, he and Matt escape, gunning through the streets in a smash-and-grab car chase.
But compared with a superior potboiler like "Salt," which messed with your brain in entertainingly far-fetched ways, "Safe House" is action-movie porridge gussied up into a less-clever-than-it-seems mystery.
Which is why the trickiness of Washington's performance begins to ebb, replaced by something somber that might even look tragic if this movie were actually about anything.
