With Facebook hogging the spotlight last week and Google working to stay in the game with Google+, Microsoft has quietly launched So.cl, which it describes as a social-search tool to share information and meet people with common interests.
You can share, comment on or tag other people's posts.
It also lets them find other users with similar interests and build communities around specific goals, educational or otherwise.
On So.cl's FAQ page, Microsoft makes it clear that their new tool is designed as a layer on top of existing networks.
