It is a transition point for troops who have served overseas, soldiers who have seen the worst that war has to offer and are returning to life at home.
Lt. Gen. Russel Honore, who served at Fort Hood in the late 1990s, said the nearly eight years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq have created difficulties for the U.S. armed forces.
"One of the biggest things on re-entry that the Readiness Center does is to help those soldiers cope with being back home and dealing with the extremes of [post-traumatic stress disorder]," Honore said.
"Some of these soldiers have lost some of their closest friends, seen some of the horrific things associated with warfare including these roadside bombs," Honore said.
"It is well documented that participation in a major conflict ... has a way of leaving its mark on the psyche of our soldiers," the Web site reads.
The Army's 1st Cavalry Division and elements of the 4th Infantry Division, as well as the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment and the 13th Corps Support Command, are based at Fort Hood.
