Murray sat silently in front of the judge at Monday's court appearance, while Jackson's elderly parents watched from the second row.
Murray is charged with involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death, which the Los Angeles County coroner ruled was from an overdose of propofol, a powerful anesthesia used to put surgical patients to sleep.
When brother Jermaine Jackson left the last hearing in June, he indicated some of them were not satisfied with the case against Murray.
His lawyer said he has no California patients, although he continues to treat patients in Nevada and Texas.
