We started with the FIFA world ranking for each team going into the World Cup, starting with Spain ranked number one, all the way down to Australia at 62.
Next we added in each country's population size, since bigger countries have larger pools to draw potential soccer stars from.
It was the second-largest country in the tournament, ranked third in the world by FIFA, and with manager Luiz Felipe Scolari's $3.8 million salary putting him fourth.
It fared well enough in the group stages, but once things got serious, the hosts completely fell apart, conceding 10 goals in their last two matches and scoring only 1.
Yes, it was ranked fifth in the world going into the tournament, but it didn't shell out big money for a manager -- Alejandro Sabella was the 22nd-best paid coach -- and Argentina falls in the middle of the population table.
Ranked 10th in the world, with the second-best paid manager and and the 11th-largest population, we think it should have come fifth.
We say Italy should have come third, not 22nd, and Russia should have tied at sixth place with the United States.
Both have populations of about 11 million people, and the two nations paid their managers exactly the same salary.
Belgium did even better, coming sixth, nine places higher than our calculations suggested.
