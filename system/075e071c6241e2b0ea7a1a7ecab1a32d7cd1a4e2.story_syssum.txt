It is produced in the fertile high-altitude slopes in the south-west of the island that became known as "La Grande Commanderie" during the Crusades.
Equally struck by the intoxicating liquor was the French King Philippe Augustus who is said to have declared it to be "the Apostle of wines".
One distinguishing feature of commandaria is that after the grapes are picked, they are left in the sun for ten days, which increases the density of their sugars.
Dimitris, together with George Metochis, senior winemaker at KEO, oversee the vast operation where annually over 130,000 liters of wine are produced, largely for market within Cyprus, but also exported to Russia, Scandinavia, France, the United States and Australia.
Lefteris Mohianakis is respectful of commandaria's great history, but says that his "Anama Concept" wine takes inspiration from the past while still very much looking towards towards the future.
"I truly believe that terroir (the geology and climate of a place) is one of the most important things towards producing a high quality wine," he says.
"My mentality is that we are walking on the base of tradition, on the base of the things transported from generation to generation -- the tales, the feelings -- but the best thing we can do is to give the vine the opportunity to choose for itself what kind of product it wants to create.
I am just trying to give the vines the opportunity to express themselves through my wine."
