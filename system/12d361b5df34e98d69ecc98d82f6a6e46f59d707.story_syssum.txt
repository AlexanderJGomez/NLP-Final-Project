After the United Nations slapped tougher sanctions on North Korea after its third nuclear test in February this year, Pyongyang screamed in defiance.
"If you talk to officials at the border, there's no change," says Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, the North Asian head of the International Crisis Group.
"Their end goal might be similar in terms of denuclearization, but China is looking at preventing war on the peninsula, which would allow a pro-Western government right on its border," says Kleine-Ahlbrandt.
"The structure of the North Korean government is very similar to the Chinese government and, in a way, it's the pure Communist state.
But public opinion is shifting and China's new leadership is recognizing the need to re-evaluate how it manages its troublesome neighbor.
