Woolley, an aid worker, husband, and father of two boys, followed instructions on his cell phone to survive the January 12 earthquake in Haiti.
To stop the bleeding on his head, he firmly pressed a sock to it.
It warned him not to sleep.
With his injuries tended to, he wrote a note to his family in his journal: "I was in a big accident, an earthquake.
But even so he will always take care of you."
They were making a film about poverty in Haiti and had just gotten back to the hotel, heading to the elevator in the lobby.
I looked for someplace safe to jump to and there was no safe place."
"So I actually took some pictures and would look at the back of the lens of the camera and saw in one of those pictures the elevator that I ended up hobbling over to.
Woolley said his phone "was like a high-tech version of a Swiss Army knife that enabled me to treat my own injuries, track time, stay awake and stay alive."
"The scene outside was a lot more chaotic and less simple than I imagined in my head.
