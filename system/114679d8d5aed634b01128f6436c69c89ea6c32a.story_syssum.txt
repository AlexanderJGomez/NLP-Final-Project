New York (CNN) -- A blind man and his black Lab service dog fell onto subway tracks and escaped injury Tuesday after an alert Metropolitan Transportation Authority employee instructed them to duck ahead of an oncoming train.
The conductor applied the brakes when he noticed Williams on the tracks, but the train came to a stop only after one and a half cars went over the man and his dog.
Cynthia told NY1 that Williams fainted and fell over into the tracks but was expected to be fine.
Cynthia added that Williams' dog, who she identified as 10-year-old Orlando, was OK and going home with her.
