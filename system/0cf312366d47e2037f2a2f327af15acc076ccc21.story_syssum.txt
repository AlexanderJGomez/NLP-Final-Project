A passerby rushed across the street to bang on the door of a fire station, knowing that firefighters are trained to provide emergency medical help.
There was a firefighter that was actually standing against the fire apparatus," she told CNN affiliate WJLA.
"It's an outrage," Washington Mayor Vincent Gray said at a news conference.
He said he apologized to Marie Mills for "what appeared to be dereliction," DC news station WTTG reported.
The protocol is in question because, according to the Mills family, those who asked for help at the fire station were told to call 911.
The employee's first response should be "to ask a senior person, and we believe that was done," he said, according to WTTG.
There are no protocols that would prevent fire personnel from helping those in need, Quander told CNN Thursday.
This is why it is so troubling that we did not take the appropriate action in this case.
Also Thursday, a spokesman said that two employees of the D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department have been suspended with pay in the wake of the incident.
"I cannot say who they were because it is a personnel matter and an ongoing investigation, but I can tell you that neither of them was the probationary firefighter involved in the incident," said Keith St. Clair, with the office of the deputy mayor for public safety.
"We need to find out why it did occur and make sure it never happens again," said Ed Smith, president of the DC Fire Fighters Association, in a statement reported by WTTG.
