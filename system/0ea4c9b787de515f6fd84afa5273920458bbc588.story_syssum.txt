Power company E.ON is planning to build a new coal-fired power plant on the site, subject to approval by the British government later this year.
The carbon dioxide is then piped back into the earth to a depth of at least 800 meters -- deep enough for the pressure of the earth to keep it in a liquidized form where it stays for thousands, if not millions, of years.
"You need the pairing of a porous reservoir overlayed and sealed by a lid of impermeable mudstone or salt rock, which is even better.
The problem is that while the different processes needed to capture and store carbon dioxide have been around for years, no one has brought them together on a large enough scale to cope with the volume of emissions from a typical power plant.
"It's a very immature economic market," says Ian Phillips, director of infrastructure at CO2DeepStore, a UK-based company dedicated to the commercialization of carbon storage.
Energy companies will have to buy all their emissions permits, so from then on any company that stores some or all of its CO2 won't have to pay.
What they need to do is take some of that income and give a grant or subsidy to those first experimental power plants."
Friends of the Earth says it's happy for CCS technology to be tested as long as it doesn't divert attention and funds away from developing renewable energy.
"The risk of not doing it is that the world continues to put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels whether it's coal or gas or oil.
The consequences of not doing it are absolutely catastrophic to ocean ecosystems and to the climate system of the world as we know it."
