WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Obama on Monday gathered together every confirmed member of his Cabinet for the first time as president and challenged them to cut $100 million in the next 90 days.
The edict is part of Obama's "commitment to go line by line through the budget to cut spending" and "reform the government," a senior administration official said.
Obama made his savings request as the House of Representatives and Senate were returning from recess this week, ready to start reconciling their versions of the fiscal 2010 budget resolution.
"But [$100 million is] about the average amount we'll spend every single day just covering the interest on the stimulus package that we passed earlier this year."
"But taken together, they can make a difference, and they send a signal that we are serious about how government operates."
