Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan authorities have made more arrests in connection with the attack on the U.S. Consulate that left the U.S. ambassador and three others dead, the president of Libya's parliament said Sunday.
The senior Libyan government official said there is no evidence yet that the attack was planned or that al Qaeda was involved.
The United States has, however, deployed warships and surveillance drones in its hunt for the killers, and a contingent of 50 Marines has arrived to boost the security of Americans in Libya.
