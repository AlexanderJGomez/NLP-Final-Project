However, Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme is about to get her first taste of real freedom in more than three decades.
In a 1987 interview with CNN affiliate WCHS, Fromme, then housed in West Virginia, recalled the president "had his hands out and was waving ... and he looked like cardboard to me.
She said she knew Ford was in town and near her, "and I said, 'I gotta go and talk to him,' and then I thought, 'That's foolish.
She said it never occurred to her that she could wind up in prison.
"My argument to the jury was, if she wanted to kill him, she would have shot him," John Virga, a Sacramento attorney appointed to defend Fromme, told CNN on Tuesday.
The Bureau of Prisons would not say whether she changed her mind and requested a hearing, but the U.S. Parole Commission's Web site says that everyone who wishes to be considered for parole, except those committed under juvenile delinquency procedures, must complete a parole application.
She was found two days later, only a few miles from the prison.
At the time, prison officials said they were looking into rumors that Fromme escaped after hearing Manson was ill, according to news reports.
In the WCHS interview, Fromme said that Manson should not be incarcerated because "he didn't kill anybody.
And she wasn't, he said, recalling that Fromme was very cooperative during her trial and describing her as "a bright, intelligent young woman" from a middle-class family.
He's got more heart and spirit than anyone I've ever met."
She said then she didn't plan to seek a parole hearing: "The parole board does not hold my life in its hands.
"I wish her the best, and hope everything works out for her, and hope she stays out of trouble," he said.
She's been in prison a long time ... it was, in my mind, a tragedy that she wound up a disciple of Manson."
