She took on one new responsibility as well: driving another mother and her son to and from the Stanford hospital, where the son was undergoing treatment for lymphoma.
The day after that Thanksgiving dinner, my mom was diagnosed for the second time with acute myelogenus leukemia (AML), a cancer of the blood -- after eight years in remission.
But South Asian donors of Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Nepalese, Bhutanese, Maldivian or Sri Lankan descent are some of the least-represented groups in the National Marrow Donor Program.
Once we learned that Mom needed a transplant, her former students, friends, and colleagues -- even those she did not know personally -- started setting up bone marrow drives around the country.
So we were shocked when we got the heartbreaking news that half of the potential donors had refused to follow up.
Although we have not yet found a match for my mom, at least six of these people have proved to be potential matches for other people desperately needing a transplant.
There is a diversity of opinions about biological donation across cultures, with some more traditional ones considering the practice taboo.
This might be one reason why India, the world's second-largest nation, has a bone marrow registry of 39,000 people, according to DATRI, a nonprofit organization which drives and maintains registries worldwide.
Screening is a simple swab of the cheek, and if you are found to be a match, donation is usually a simple outpatient procedure called Peripheral Blood Stem Cell collection.
So I'll settle for challenging everyone who reads this to get on the Bone Marrow Registry.
