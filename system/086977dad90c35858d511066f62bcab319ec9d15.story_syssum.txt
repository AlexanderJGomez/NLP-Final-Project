Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- Family members of Meredith Kercher said Saturday they were satisfied with the verdict that found American Amanda Knox and her Italian ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, guilty of the fatal knifing of the British student.
Knox and Sollecito were found guilty of murder Friday after a lengthy, sensational trial.
The pair was accused of staging a theft to cover up the killing.
The inmates and the guards were all taking great care of her.
"We're all in shock; we're all heartened by the support" that she said residents of Perugia and other Italians had shown.
Sollecito's lawyer, Luca Maori, criticized his client's punishment -- less than the life sentence the prosecution requested but far short of exonerating Sollecito -- as making no sense.
People who disagree with the verdict should at least respect it, because so many professionals were involved in the investigation, Mignini said.
He told CNN the situation has been a trying experience, and Knox hardly slept Friday night after the verdict.
Jurors must submit an explanation of how they reached their decision to the judge within 90 days, and this "jury motivation" will be made public.
