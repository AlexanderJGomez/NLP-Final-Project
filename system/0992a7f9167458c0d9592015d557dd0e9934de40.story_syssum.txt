Iranian women demonstrate Saturday in front of the White House, where President Obama issued a statement.
No independent monitors were permitted for the election, and protests against the outcome grew in succeeding days.
Thousands of protesters took to the streets Saturday, even though the demonstrations were banned and police confronted them with clubs, tear gas and water cannons.
"It's not productive, given the history of U.S.-Iranian relations, to be seen as meddling, the U.S. president meddling in Iranian elections," Obama said this week.
Several diplomats told CNN that Iran is in "unchartered territory" and said this weekend's events could determine the fate of the regime.
