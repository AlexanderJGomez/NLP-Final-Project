(CNN) -- The International Committee of the Red Cross has been granted access to a detention facility in Syria for the first time since unrest broke out in the country, the committee's president said Monday after meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Syria has been engulfed in public protest for months, and the regime has been accused internationally of a crackdown on peaceful demonstrators.
The foreign minister "stressed that the public hospitals in Syria are constantly ready and provide the required medical services for all the citizens," the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported Monday.
On Sunday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said four people were killed in Idlib province and three others were killed in the village of Tahtaiya by security forces pursuing wanted activists.
A security patrol pursued the attackers and killed three of them, wounding a fourth and seizing explosives, guns and medical supplies from their stolen pickup, the news agency said.
The United Nations has reported more than 2,200 people killed in Syria since February, including more than 350 people since security forces stepped up operations against demonstrators during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
