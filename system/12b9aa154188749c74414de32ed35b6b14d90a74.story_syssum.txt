Opponents of President Barack Obama's plan, which makes sweeping changes to the nation's immigration system by use of executive order, focused their criticism on the legal case, saying Obama has overstepped the boundaries of his authority and is ignoring the will of the people.
"President Obama has once again put divisive and manipulative politics before the sober leadership and sound laws required of an exceptional nation," Bush said in a statement.
We must demonstrate to Americans we are the party that will tackle serious challenges and build broad-based consensus to achieve meaningful reforms for our citizens and our future."
"His actions are not only unconstitutional and in defiance of the American people who said they did not want amnesty in the 2014 elections, but they are also unfair to every immigrant who has come to our nation legally," Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas posted to his Facebook profile.
Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, the second-place finisher in the 2012 battle for the GOP presidential nod and a potential 2016 contender, called the executive order "just another in a long line of power-grabs by this administration.
The President's actions now make all of this harder and are unfair to people in our immigration system who are doing things the right way."
Louisiana Sen. David Vitter pledged on Twitter that he will do "everything I can" to stop Obama's move, "starting with removing any funding for amnesty."
Sadly, rather than trying to solve our country's immigration problems, the President's actions are intended to poison the legislative process at a time when he should be working to bring Americans together.
