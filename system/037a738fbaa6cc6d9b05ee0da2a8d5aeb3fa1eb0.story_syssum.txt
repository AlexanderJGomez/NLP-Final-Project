After nearly 40 years on the throne, King Juan Carlos I of Spain said Monday that he will be stepping down.
Spaniards generally hold King Juan Carlos, 76, in high regard for his service to the nation and his defense of democracy after the death of the dictator Francisco Franco in 1975.
Many consider the King's finest hour to be his decisive stand to halt a right-wing military coup in 1981, when he went on television to say that the monarchy would not tolerate attempts to interrupt democracy by force.
In Franco's Spain, he carried out military training and became the first Spanish officer to hold the rank of lieutenant in all three branches of the military.
On November 22, 1975 -- two days after Franco's death -- Juan Carlos was crowned king of Spain, restoring the monarchy after a 44-year interregnum.
The King had previously expressed his concern about the impact of the crisis on Spaniards and called on the nation to come together to get through the tough times.
There have been open calls for the King to abdicate in favor of Prince Felipe, who is seen as untouched by the scandals.
