Investigators found a calendar showing that the couple planned to sail to the Caribbean in November, federal prosecutor Michael Harvey told the court.
The two have the financial means to obtain false documents and flee to Cuba with their sailboat or through Mexico or Canada, he said.
A defense attorney urged the court to allow them to remain in their home, where they could visit with their children.
The State Department has not described what information the Myerses may have passed to their Cuban handlers, but said more information would come out after a full assessment.
A future trial date has not been scheduled.
