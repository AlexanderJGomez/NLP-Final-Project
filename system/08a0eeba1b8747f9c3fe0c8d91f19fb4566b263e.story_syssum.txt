Despite the city's low ranking, there are some in Hong Kong with a long-term strategy to import players and know-how from the world's best: embattled football-superpower Spain.
Ken Ng, head of Hong Kong Kitchee, one of the top local teams, has been working with former Spanish athletes for years to develop local players.
Ng brought two Spanish veterans to the Far East to help: Josep Gombau, a veteran of Barcelona youth football education and current Kitchee head coach, and retired La Liga player Roberto "Chino" Losada, also a former Kitchee player.
There, the players will compete in events like the Mediterranean International Cup, a top juvenile international tournament held in Catalonia.
"If things don't improve in my country, in Europe, I wouldn't have a problem [staying in Hong Kong]," Panera told CNN.
