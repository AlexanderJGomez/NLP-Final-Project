"We have a lot of support from sponsors, from different international and multinational companies that see it as an opportunity to offer their brands and their experiences as well and it makes it way more profitable," said owner of The Garden, Ismael Kassem.
At least five new drinking establishments have recently opened their doors in the city -- a sign the industry maybe slowly shaking off three years of despair.
The election of an Islamist President, Mohamed Morsi, in 2012 had the industry fearful for its survival.
"A lot of investors are looking at what is running and surviving the revolution, and economic prices and that is mainly food outlets, coffee shops and I would say eventually nightlife," Rizk said.
But this is Egypt, where political and economic chaos persist and neither Kassem nor Rizk take that for granted.
Both Kassem and Rizk hope it will pay out in dividends.
