As evacuees from last year's Fukushima nuclear disaster, Mikio and Hamako lost everything: their home, their jobs, and any hope for the future.
"If there was no nuclear accident, we wouldn't have gone through this terrible thing," he says.
The aim of his lawsuit, he says, is to push TEPCO and the Japanese government to stop treating the nuclear accident as if it's a natural disaster.
Watanabe says his wife began to worry incessantly about how to pay off their mortgage, made worse because they had nothing to fill their days as evacuees.
Watanabe went to bed with his wife, feeling happier and more comfortable than he had in many weeks.
"At 1 a.m., I woke up to use the restroom and when I went back to bed, she grabbed my arm and wouldn't let go.
Watanabe continued to weed around his house and went inside to take a shower.
He recalls being shocked and standing frozen but he also remembers trying to put out the fire with his hands.
But he will never forget the image of his wife's charred and stiff body, her legs and midriff still burning, and the flies beginning to gather around her open mouth.
I lost my wife in such a terrible way.
Their despair and their anger that they have no foreseeable future stands behind this case."
Due to the size of the affected area, TEPCO and the Japanese government are unable to estimate if and when residents will ever be able to return.
