"Police express concern over the video clip showing several plainclothes officers who are suspected of using excessive force," said a statement issued by the Hong Kong Information Services Department Wednesday morning.
The victim has been identified as Ken Tsang, a member of the Civic Party, who's also a social worker and a member of the 1,200 member election committee that choses Hong Kong's leader.
He said some people had accused Tsang of pouring water on police, but "whatever he was doing he was already arrested, his hands were cuffed and the proper procedure was to take him into custody and deal with him in accordance with the law."
The road runs past the central government offices, and is near the main Admiralty protest site, the epicenter of the weeks long standoff between protesters and police.
Authorities accused them of behaving "in a disorderly manner," throwing traffic cones, snatching police barriers and building road blocks.
"Protestors advancing against Police cordon line even with their arms raised is not a peaceful act," the statement said.
Since late September, protesters from a number of pro-democracy groups have been blocking major roads, demanding a greater say in who leads the Special Administrative Region of China.
Traffic in the other parts of the city has been clogged due to road closures, bus and tram cancellations and the need for cars to drive around the protest sites.
He added he would not submit to the protesters' demands that he resign, because his resignation "will not solve the problem."
The move was seen as a miscalculation and only served to garner support for the protesters, who accused the government of heavy handedness and of stifling free speech.
