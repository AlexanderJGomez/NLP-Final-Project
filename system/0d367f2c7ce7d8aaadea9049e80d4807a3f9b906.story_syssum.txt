(CNN) -- If you set your alarm this morning for quarter-past ungodly (California time) to catch the predawn announcement of the Oscars nominations, then we're in the same twisted little club.
This year for old times' sake we revived our game, only doing the best actor category because it's been an impossibly full year of great male lead performances that have stumped the prognosticators.
Today the results came in and we all tied with four corrects each, but with different names on our lists.
But did anyone ever imagine that betting against Mr. Oscars himself, Tom Hanks, could pay off?
My favorite year was 1978, the night Jane Fonda and Jon Voight took the best leads categories for "Coming Home."
As a professional plower of the fields of celebrity, with a license to fawn and gush (want to see my card?)
Not even the cruel realization that there are essentially two red carpets -- velvet stanchions separate the stars on one side from the rest of us attendees -- could squelch my blind and blinded-by-the-flashbulbs enthusiasm.
In poor Oscar's defense, for the past decade or so Hollywood's big night has had to suffer indignities that the Academy of Old couldn't have imagined: dwindling viewership, the cultural-relevance supremacy of TV over movies, an attention deficit that just can't sit still for the live-action shorts category, acting and directing victories basically pre-called by critics and Tweeters and bookies, James Franco.
Critics' awards, the People's Choice Awards, the Golden Globes, the SAG Awards â€” you can only cut to a reaction shot of Jennifer Lawrence so many times before it constitutes stalking.
Will I sound like I'm on the Academy's payroll if I argue that the Oscars really are a great national tradition?
Dutifully filling out the ballots at your friend's Oscars party even if the only movie you saw that year starred Adam Sandler.
