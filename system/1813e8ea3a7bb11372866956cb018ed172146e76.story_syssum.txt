The federal agency lifted its warning about tomatoes but left in place a warning about raw jalape√±o and serrano peppers, having previously said those foods also may be linked to the outbreak.
Many of the infected people were thought to have eaten tomatoes from farms in south Florida and parts of Mexico, but inspectors haven't found the outbreak strain on those farms, Acheson said, according to the AP.
Federal health investigators have visited farms in Florida, Texas and Mexico to try to determine the source of the outbreak, according to the CDC.
In most cases, an infected person will recover within a week without medicine simply by staying hydrated, doctors have said.
