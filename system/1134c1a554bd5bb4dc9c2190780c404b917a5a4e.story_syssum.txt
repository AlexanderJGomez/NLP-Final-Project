The mice are also threatening the native population of bunting, one of the world's largest finches, the RSPB said.
Adult Tristan albatross are threatened by longline fishing at sea, a practice in which boats put up numerous 100-meter long fishing lines baited with squid or fish.
Because of the impact from house mice, introduced to the island by sealers in the 18th and 19th centuries, conservation alliance BirdLife International earlier this year listed both the Tristan albatross and the Gough bunting as critically endangered -- the highest threat level before extinction.
"We've known for a long time that the mice were killing albatross chicks in huge numbers," said RSPB scientist Richard Cuthbert, who recently visited the island to assess the problem.
It said eradicating the mice from Gough Island would solve the primary conservation threat facing both bird species.
The RSPB said it had been working with New Zealand conservationists on a program to remove the smaller mice by dropping poisoned bait from helicopters.
The birds can fly thousands of miles without a pause, and their only need to touch land is to nest and raise their young, the RSPB says.
