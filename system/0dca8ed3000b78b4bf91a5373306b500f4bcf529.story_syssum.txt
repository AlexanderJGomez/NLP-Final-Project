A little girl, no taller than the weeds that surround her, stands in a field and picks petals from a delicate daisy.
The aim of the one-minute spot, widely known as the first political attack ad, was to frame Republican Barry Goldwater as a warmonger.
It aired only once, during an NBC broadcast of the film "David and Bathsheba," as part of the network's popular "Monday Night at the Movies."
But the advertising giant responsible for the Johnson ad, Doyle Dane Bernbach, understood what made people buy things -- and ideas.
"It was almost like a crusade not to have Goldwater become president," said Sidney Myers, the creative director at Dane Doyle Bernbach at the time who helped make the ad.
The firm was hired by the Democratic National Committee to work on a series of 27 anti-Goldwater ads, five of which focused on nuclear warfare.
Myers, now 82, said he was listening to soundtracks of children with sound engineer Tony Schwartz, another mastermind behind the Daisy ad, and they came across sound of a child counting from one to 10.
The Daisy ad was actually shot in a residential field in Manhattan, he said, adding that it took about two hours and 15 to 20 takes to get the shot they wanted from the little girl, child actress Monique Luiz.
When Luiz moved to Phoenix -- home of the Goldwater's department store -- about 20 years after the ad, she warily avoided the chain, worried she might be found out.
Luiz admitted she's not a fan of all the attention the ad has brought over the past 50 years, nor does she feel "completely proud" that the commercial set a precedent for what's become five decades of increasingly negative political ads.
