If  your ex's loved ones ask why you broke up, it's OK to admit he cheated on you, writer says.
Email his crappiest crap e-mail to Jezebel.com's Crap E-mail From A Dude and when they publish it, discreetly post the link as your GChat away message.
Especially if he's the one who caused the breakup, he probably doesn't have the cojones to ask for it back now.
...or lose that extra 10 lbs so you can fit into your sexy jeans again.
You might hear from his mom, sisters, or other family members you were close to after the breakup, especially if you dated for a long time.
And any mom or sister worth her salt will tear your ex a new one when they learn that's why he lost a great girl like you.
But kept posting stuff on your social networking sites on the regular.
Spend a few months feeling down.
Indulge in some therapy.
The next time you run into your ex, mention all the great things that have happened in your life since you broke up ... or just smile.
The Frisky: Happy to be single
