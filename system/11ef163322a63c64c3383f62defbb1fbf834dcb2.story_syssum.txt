Interim Superintendent Erroll B. Davis Jr. received school board approval to mandate ethics training for employees and provide remedial help to perhaps thousands of Atlanta Public Schools students who may have improperly advanced because of the cheating.
Nathan Deal said Tuesday in unveiling the results of a state investigation that confirmed widespread cheating in city schools dating as far back as 2001.
Davis told reporters he expects to move forward on the first personnel actions on Monday.
"We reaffirm Dr. Hall's position that she most definitely did not know of any widespread cheating on the CRCT (Criterion-Referenced Competency Tests) in 2009 or any other year," she said in a statement released through her attorney.
The state's report indicated there was a climate of cheating and performance-at-all-costs during Hall's tenure.
Investigators compared the results with test results from other Georgia schools and found that such patterns did not occur normally, Deal said.
NAPPS said authorities found no evidence of changed answers, test tampering or a cover-up at any of the eight schools in its cluster.
Administrators must ensure there are equal opportunities at all schools, she said, while parents must become more involved in their children's education -- both at school and home.
"Having good information to measure student progress is an absolute bedrock requirement in ensuring that schools are preparing our children for success."
