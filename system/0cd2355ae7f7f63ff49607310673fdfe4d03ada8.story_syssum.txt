(CNN) -- The federal agency that protects the nation's borders is doing a shoddy job protecting the nation's wallet, abusing an overtime fund to the tune of $8.7 million annually, according to a government watchdog.
In February of that year, a whistleblower alleged abuses at the Office of Border Patrol in Lynden, Washington.
The use of administrative overtime "functionally [extended] their daily shift by two hours each day, but are not the result of any unpredictable or compelling law enforcement need," Lerner wrote.
Citizenship and Immigration Services' Office of Security and Integrity in Washington.
House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul said the revelations the overtime allowance is meant for agents who work unique hours "often in pursuit of drug smugglers" and other people "who pose a threat" to the nation.
