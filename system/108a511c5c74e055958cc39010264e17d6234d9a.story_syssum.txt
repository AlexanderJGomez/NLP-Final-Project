Health care teams are now giving anti-rabies shots to three other patients who received organs from the same donor as the patient, the CDC said.
The Maryland recipient died February 27 at the VA Medical Center in Washington, and doctors at the CDC diagnosed rabies as the cause of death.
Dr. Matthew Kuehnert, director of the CDC's Office of Blood, Organ, and Other Tissue Safety, said the recipients' doctors were shocked to learn the donor's organs were tainted with rabies.
Organ donors are not routinely tested for rabies, even if they show the signs.
"What we need looking forward is a standardized approach when you have encephalitis of unknown cause so very important things like this aren't missed," he said.
Other patients waiting for organs such as hearts or livers might die quickly without a transplant -- and sometimes the only organ available is one where the patient died of encephalitis and no one knows why.
"Statistically it's quite likely the organ could be fine, but if it's not, everybody has trouble," she told CNN.
