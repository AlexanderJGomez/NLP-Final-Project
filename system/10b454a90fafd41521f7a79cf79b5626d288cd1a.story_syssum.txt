Vedad Ibisevic brought his homeland to within a goal of Argentina with a score in the 84th minute at Rio De Janeiro's Maracana Stadium, trickling a score past Argentine goaltender Sergio Romero.
It turns out the deciding goal was Argentina's second tally, by none other than Lionel Messi, arguably the world's greatest (and most scrutinized) player, who has a history of underperforming in the World Cup.
But entering this year's World Cup, much of the focus lay on Messi's lack of goal scoring in the 2010 tournament, which ended with a 4-0 Argentine loss to Germany in the quarterfinals.
Seferovic's 93rd minute goal was the latest anyone has ever scored in World Cup group play, according to ESPN.
"It was a dream end to the game for us and is very important for the morale of the team," he said.
The latter was the situation Sunday when France's second goal in a 3-0 win over Honduras barely leaked over the line.
Only one of the replays showed the ball likely over the line, but on the screen, FIFA's animated representation indicated it was a goal by a few inches.
While the number of goals per game had been trending down since the 1994 World Cup held in the United States, this tournament has seen an early explosion in the number of balls hitting the back of the net.
Ok, we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves; there are 52 matches left.
