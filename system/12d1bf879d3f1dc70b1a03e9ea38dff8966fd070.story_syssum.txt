The announcement that Universal Studios plans to donate a portion of the "Fast and Furious 6" DVD, Blu-ray and digital sales to Walker's charity, Reach Out WorldWide, is just the latest instance of the continued buzz that has surrounded the actor since he and a friend were killed in a car crash on Saturday.
"This is completely inconsistent with our brand values and the jars have since been removed," a spokesperson for the company said in a statement to the site Gossip Cop.
He said the family of the celeb plays a key factor in the discussion regarding the ethics of money making post a star's death.
Production of "Fast & Furious 7," which was filming in Atlanta at the time of Walker's death, has been halted.
The London Evening Standard reported on the outrage following those tweets with at least one Twitter user calling for the company's social media manager to be fired.
When Jezebel editor Erin Gloria Ryan tweeted (and later deleted) "Why couldn't it be Scott Walker :-( #wisconsintweets" referring to the Republican Wisconsin governor who this summer was criticized for an abortion law he signed, she was roundly slammed.
Such grief could easily calculate to robust sales for the DVD of what may become Walker's last "Fast & Furious" film if the studio decides to scrap the latest production, given the sensitivities of showing an actor who died in a car crash in a film about driving fast cars.
That could also mean a boost for Walker's charity, Reach Out Worldwide, which offers assistance around the world during disaster.
"The fan base is not going to go away just because a celebrity dies."
