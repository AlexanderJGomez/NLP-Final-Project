ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Dressed head to toe in black, designer Isaac Mizrahi is wearing an outfit that seems to contradict his personality -- and his usual fashion flair.
Despite the slightly audacious title, Mizrahi, who has won four awards from the Council of Fashion Designers of America, has earned the right to tell women how to dress.
CNN talked to Mizrahi about his love for theater, the most common fashion mistakes and why bad flowers are never OK.
And I think that these days, as a fashion designer, it's almost like you represent a political party or something.
Whatever it is, she knows that it just makes her life really easy so she associates with it, you know?
I design costumes constantly for theater and ballet and opera.
But when I get to work is when it changes up.
I feel like it really disrupts what I love doing most, which is this creation, you know what I mean?
I would say that's the most common style error I see is bad hair.
But I always think that women should be encouraged to spend a lot of money on their hair.
You do a line for Target that's ending this year.
I think people get lazy when it comes to being at home -- they leave things around.
You put the salt shakers in a cabinet, and the table looks so much better when it's plain.
Like at a dinner party, I prefer no flowers usually to the flowers that people have on the table.
I can't say about my personality, but I like to think that I'm very exposed to what's going on out there in the world culturally, and that's what influences my design.
Here's what the clothes look like; here's what you should be wearing.
I don't like to commit to one thing necessarily, but when I do commit to it, it's whole and complete.
