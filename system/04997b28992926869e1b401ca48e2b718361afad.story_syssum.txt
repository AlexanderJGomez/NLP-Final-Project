Richard Phillips reportedly offered himself as a hostage to the pirates during an attack Wednesday on the U.S.-flagged container ship Maersk Alabama in the Indian Ocean.
"For security reasons, the vessel will berth in a restricted area of the port and will not be accessible to the media.
The U.S. Navy -- which is in charge of the situation -- requested help from the FBI to resolve the standoff.
The probe will be led by the FBI's New York field office, which has responsibility for looking into cases involving U.S. citizens in the African region.
Earlier Saturday, pirates sailing a hijacked German cargo ship returned to port after failing to reach the area of the standoff with the Bainbridge, a local journalist told CNN.
The pirate crew had intended to help the pirates holding Phillips but turned back because of the U.S. naval presence, the journalist said.
The guided missile frigate USS Halyburton, with helicopter capabilities, has joined the Bainbridge in the area.
Attacks in the area have picked up so drastically in recent months that the Navy has to reposition some of its fleet to deal with the threats, he said.
"Well, we got the international news stories on television on the ship and everybody's concerned about the route that we were on because there was always the possibility that we would be approached by pirates," one male passenger said.
