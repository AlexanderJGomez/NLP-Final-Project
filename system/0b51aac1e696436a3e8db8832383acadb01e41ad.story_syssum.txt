(CNN) -- Mother Nature showed her extremes across the United States on Tuesday, with another day of dangerously hot temperatures broiling the Southwest while parts of the Northeast grapple with flooding from torrential storms.
That's dreadful news for much of California, Nevada and Arizona, states that have all seen temperatures top 120 degrees in the past few days.
Because heat stroke or heat exhaustion can strike within minutes, hundreds of Las Vegas residents have sought relief in a Salvation Army cooling shelter.
Showers and storms will stretch from Florida to New England through Thursday, dampening the Independence Day holiday, the National Weather Service said.
Thunderstorms also produced three small tornadoes in Connecticut and New Jersey on Monday, but there were no reported injuries, the weather service and local authorities said.
And the flooding could get worse -- cities from Georgia to New England could see 2 to 3 more inches of rain in the next few days.
