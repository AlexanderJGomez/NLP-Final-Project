Claudia Aderotimi, 20, died early Tuesday, shortly after receiving buttocks enhancements in a hotel room near Philadelphia International Airport, according to police.
Aderotimi and three other women had traveled from England to undergo the cosmetic procedure in Philadelphia, police said.
Last month, New York officials arrested a woman for allegedly illegally injecting liquid silicone as part an underground business she ran out of her home, according to the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office.
The women developed symptoms after injections for buttocks enhancement and received surgical and antibiotic treatment, according to the state health agency.
"In our cluster, these patients had to be hospitalized," she said, adding that injection procedures should be performed by licensed health providers.
