"The dining car developed axle problems that disabled the train 2 miles north of the Staples Mill Road Station in Richmond around 5:30 p.m. Sunday," said Amtrak spokeswoman Kimberly Woods, via e-mail.
"The train began a very slow move (at 3:45 a.m.) to a siding in Richmond and arrived to the station just after 6:30 a.m. and a replacement car was added," she said.
Passenger Kevin Smith was frustrated at how long it took Amtrak to solve the problem.
"A delay of this magnitude is considered rare and we understand the passengers' frustrations from last night's events," she said.
