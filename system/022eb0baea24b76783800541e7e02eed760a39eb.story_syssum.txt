The killing quickly triggered condemnations from Palestinian and Israeli leaders, as well as from the United States.
Israeli authorities are probing Wednesday's death, with police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld tweeting this effort will try to determine if it is a "criminal or nationalistic" act -- the latter term referring to a politically motivated act in retaliation for the Israeli  teens' killings.
This came hours after Netanyahu's office promised a speedy investigation to find "who is behind this despicable murder and the background to this act," according to a statement from his office.
Rosenfeld told the Jerusalem Post the teen had significant burn marks.
Yet Hussain Abu Khedair, the boy's father, blamed Israelis and vehemently denied reports that this may have been tied to any sort of family dispute.
"It is sickening to think of an innocent 17-year-old boy snatched off the streets and his life stolen from him and his family," said Secretary of State of John Kerry, who talked with Netanyahu by phone about the situation.
As news of the boy's death spread, public anger in Palestinian neighborhoods of Jerusalem rose to levels rarely, if ever, seen since the Second Intifada, or uprising, last decade.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society reported that more than 100 were injured, most of them in Shuafat, in the clashes.
But his father said Thursday he was still waiting to hear from Israeli authorities when the body would be handed over to the family.
Palestinian medical sources reported at least 10 injured, one of them seriously.
This action follows the abduction of Israeli teens Eyal Yifrach, Gilad Shaar and Naftali Frankel as they were on their way home from school June 13; the three were found dead on Monday in a West Bank field.
That is the secret of our strength."
