(EW.com) -- ABC entertainment president Paul Lee says he's going to take a look at the long-gestating Star Wars live-action TV series now that the Disney deal to acquire Lucasfilm is complete.
Even many working in Hollywood don't realize a live-action Star Wars TV series has been sitting on the shelf the past few years.
The president of one premium cable outlet told me last summer the project just didn't make any financial sense.
The Star Wars show was budgeted at more than $5 million per episode and Lucasfilm wanted to retain ownership.
Cautious brand managers are sometimes reluctant to have a live-action TV show on the air when producing live-action films â€” such as Warner Bros. putting the kibosh on any Batman TV projects while making Christopher Nolan's trilogy.
Sources say the live-action series centers on the story of rival families struggling over the control of the seedy underside of the Star Wars universe and the people who live within the subterranean level and air shafts of the metropolis planet Coruscant (the Empire's urban-sprawl-covered home planet).
Extensive art work including character designs, costume designs, and set designs were all developed by a top team of concept artists and designers who worked for more than a year on the third floor design studio at George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch's main house on the project.
In fact, sources say story materials and the designs for the TV project were used to help make the game.
