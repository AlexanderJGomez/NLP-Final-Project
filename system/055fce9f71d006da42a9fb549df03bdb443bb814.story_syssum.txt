An increase in handmade technology accessories and vintage patterns for clothes are popular, too, as art and craft enthusiasts find new ways to develop their creative talents.
"While we had never actively solicited artwork or crafts from fans, we were seeing so much incredible stuff posted across the web, and were inspired to build 'Coco MoCA - The Museum Of Conan Art' -- an internet gallery to celebrate these fantastic artists' talent," said John A.
"There is an added value for the buyer that comes from having a real interaction with the real human being that created each handmade object," said Etsy spokesperson, Adam Brown.
Etsy makes money by charging sellers a listing fee of 20 cents for each item and receives 3.5% commission on the price of each sale.
Consumers who can't get enough of these pop culture icons have plenty of artistic options to choose from this year, both online and at art and craft shows.
Crafters will be inspired throughout the year, according to Roselli, to make cases for items like smartphones, iPads and Kindles, to name a few.
In fashion, pleating, smocking and detailed embellishments in a style that mixes the 1940s and 1970s will be trendy for crafters throughout 2011.
Roselli says what's trending with indie clothes makers is an aged natural color like a dusty brown or grey, complemented by a bold, rich color like honeysuckle, plum, or yellow to brighten and modernize a garment or accessory.
