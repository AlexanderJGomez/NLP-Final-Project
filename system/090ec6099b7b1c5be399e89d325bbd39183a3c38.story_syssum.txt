Benghazi, Libya (CNN) -- Hip-hop artists don't often smile, so it was no surprise that Libyan rapper MC Swat scowled suspiciously when I first walked into his cramped, cigarette smoke-filled studio in a former government building in Benghazi.
The building's hallways are covered with art and anti-regime cartoons, and the rooms are often buzzing through the wee hours of the morning with dozens of young revolutionary artists at work.
On the third floor, the rock band Guys Underground practices its latest song dedicated to the revolution.
"It feels like we're touching freedom," said MC Swat, who often sleeps overnight in his studio.
You can see they have weapons, but they're fighting for our freedom.
