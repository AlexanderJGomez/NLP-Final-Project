The divers stopped searching months ago because of the winter and water conditions, and the South Korean ferry remains on the bottom of the sea floor.
"We, the families of the missing victims, are still living the day --  April 16, 2014," said Park, who is in poor health, but refusing treatment.
But families say the underlying problems that led to the sinking of the Sewol are far from resolved.
As the ferry tilted sideways, water seeped in and objects in the ship toppled over, injuring people and blocking their way out.
A government study on raising the ferry released last week identified a crane and floating dock as the safest way to look for the missing.
The process could take over a year and a half, and that it would cost the South Korean government anywhere from $91 million to $182 million.
The recovery efforts have also taken a deadly toll with a total of six deaths -- a diver searching the Sewol died in May, and in July, five people died after a helicopter carrying emergency workers involved in the operation crashed.
Its cargo wasn't secured properly, which threw the ship off balance as the containers tumbled and knocked the vessel off balance.
The sinking spurred a debate about the shortcomings of the government and what preventive measures should have been taken.
Sewol's captain, Lee Joon-seok, who was widely derided for jumping to safety, was sentenced to 36 years in prison for abandonment causing death and injury, and violating sea laws.
