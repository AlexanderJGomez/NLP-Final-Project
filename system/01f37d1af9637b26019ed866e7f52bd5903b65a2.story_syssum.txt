The Washington Post captured the reaction perfectly, writing that Macy had a "look on her face that has never been witnessed by anyone who is not a dad chaperoning a minivan full of teenagers at a One Direction concert."
And who else would she react that way to meeting?
I was excited because, I thought, she was saying hi to a lot of people.
And then, she came out and she is like, 'Hey you.'
I think Hillary Clinton is a a really good role model for girls of all ages and it [the reason she liked the attention] isn't just because it got a lot of cool places.
Macy: I like her because, like, she is running for president and a lot of people think that girls shouldn't be president because they are not as smart or they shouldn't have the same rights.
I knew that she was the first lady for a while.
And when I first went up to her, I said, 'Macy,' and she said that is one of her favorite names.
CNN: A local anchor in your hometown joked that you would be the first women president.
Macy: I would say that even if you are different or you are a different gender, it doesn't matter what you look like.
And one more thing: Make sure if Finn [her 12-year old brother] does give you the permission to use the photo, give him photo cred!
