ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Civilians continued to flee Pakistan's northwest in droves Monday as government troops prepared to engage Taliban militants in the crisis-hit Swat Valley.
Journalists have not been permitted to observe the offensive and the army has not shown bodies of the militants it says it has killed.
Vehicles are not allowed back into the region, which has led to a shortage for those trying to leave.
In other developments, a suicide car bomber attacked a Pakistani paramilitary checkpoint outside Peshawar on Monday, killing a Frontier Corps soldier and three civilians, said Ali Sher Khan, a Corps spokesman.
