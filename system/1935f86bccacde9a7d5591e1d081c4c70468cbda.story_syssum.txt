He is a suspect in the killings of each of the four women, who were found dead on Detroit's east side last December, a prosecutor said in court.
Detroit police Chief Ralph Godbee later explained that one reason murder charges haven't been filed is that, while all the bodies were found in his city, the women weren't necessarily killed there.
A lawyer for Backpage.com, Steve Suskin, said then that the company's website didn't necessarily have anything to do with the women or their deaths.
Around 6 a.m. Tuesday, authorities arrested Brown and "another black male, age 32" about 20 miles north of Detroit in Sterling Heights, Michigan, Detroit police said in a statement Saturday.
Landers' uncle, Leon Mims, said that he and other relatives hope that Brown's arrest will spur the investigation, including determining key details and whether others might have been involved.
