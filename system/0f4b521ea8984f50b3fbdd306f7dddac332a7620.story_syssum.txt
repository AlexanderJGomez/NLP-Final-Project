To find out more about himself and the family members who paved the way for his success, this hall-of-fame inductee followed his roots to Burnt Corn, Alabama, the town where his great-grandmother was born.
Genealogist Marjorie Sholes told Emmitt that "Puryear" was probably the name of a slave owner.
"African-Americans, at the end of the Civil War, sometimes picked the names of their last slave owner," she says.
To explore this theory, Emmitt traveled to Mecklenburg, Virginia, to learn more about a notorious slave trader who owned Mariah at some point in history.
"Maybe it is my destiny, and I've always believed I was a child of destiny, but, whew, this is ... it's making me a little bit nervous."
John helped him find a property deed stating that Mariah was transferred from Samuel to his son, Alexander.
"They treated my people like animals...but worse than animals."
I couldn't imagine them being passed down through slavery that way."
Emmitt says he felt the true power of his newfound knowledge while sitting on the porch of an old slave quarters in Clayborn, Alabama.
After learning what he could from dusty record books, Emmitt took the next step in his genealogical journey and had a DNA test.
Emmitt's journey has come to an end, but he encourages anyone who's curious about their roots to follow in his footsteps.
