Most of it is in a newly discovered magma reservoir, which the scientists featured in a study published on Thursday in the journal Science.
Yellowstone's ultimate heat source reaches down 440 to 1,800 miles beneath Earth's surface -- and may come from its molten core.
It is a three to nine miles under the surface of the Earth and is what fuels the geysers, steaming puddles and other hot attractions.
"The actual hazard is the same, but now we have a much better understanding of the complete crustal magma system," said researcher Robert B. Smith.
Its dust may have blocked sunlight around the world, chilling the air and dropping the Earth's climate into a frigid phase that garnered the year 1816 the "year without a summer," some climatologists believe.
The explosions have left deep scars, and park goers often become familiar with one -- the Yellowstone Caldera, which takes up much of the park and is lined by a roundish mountainous ridge.
Those were the two largest eruptions in North America in a few million years, the USGS said, and they each buried in ash more than a third of what is now the continental U.S.
Volcanic activity triggers 2,000 to 3,000 small earthquakes per year, and the shake and shock waves travel at different speeds through molten, hot and other rock.
But more recently in 2003, ground temperatures rose high enough to dry out geysers and boil the sap in some trees.
So, national park authorities closed Yellowstone to keep people from burning their feet -- or basting their tires on melting roads.
