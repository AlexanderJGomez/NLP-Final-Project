John Edward Jones, 26, of Stansbury Park was stuck in the Nutty Putty Cave, which sits west of Utah Lake near Cedar Valley, according to the sheriff's office of Utah County.
"During the course of that, they have a raising system to hold him in position, and one of the devices of that system failed, and Mr. Jones actually fell back to the area where he had been stuck for so long."
There are narrow areas of the cave where visitors have to crawl on their bellies to get through, according to the attraction's Web site.
Up to 5,000 people visit each year, the site said.
