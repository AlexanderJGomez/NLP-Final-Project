(CNN) -- People have called 911 to complain about lousy hamburgers and cold french fries, but what happened Sunday night in a Connecticut town may have set a new standard for misuse of emergency calls.
The Fairfield Police Department was not amused and took to its Facebook page to post a refresher course on using its emergency system.
911 should only be called for Life Threatening Emergencies ONLY.
Cablevision said it had restored service by 11 p.m. Sunday.
When a lack of cable TV is a reason to call 911, "I have to wonder what this world is coming to and if people truly understand the definition of emergency," read another comment.
That, plus the crickets and peepers, has turned this into a very good night indeed."
