But with expectations beyond high for Google to swoop in and save the day from Apple's unreliable, problematic maps app -- which replaced the existing Google Maps app in September with the rollout of the new iOS 6 software -- many just hoped Google's version would live up to promises of being a superior mapping platform for the iPhone.
Overall, users will have to choose to access it over Apple Maps which already comes on the platform.
The hits just kept on coming, too -- police in Australia recently issued a warning not to rely on Apple Maps since it was steering users to areas far from their destinations and in one case, misdirected a group of people who became stranded in dangerous terrain with no water.
A perk for both platforms: voice-assistant Siri can help users out with directions via Apple Maps, while Google's platform also features voice guided turn-by-turn navigation.
Users can select a home and work address within their profile to keep it on hand and quickly get directions.
Although Google Maps incorporates 2D and 3D views via Street View, as well as the rotating and tilting of maps with gestures inside the app, we still prefer Apple's design.
For example, Google has partnered with such as Yelp and Zagat to provide users with a full look at restaurant reviews, menus, photos and making reservations.
Public transit, street view and easy searching propel Google to a clear victory -- for now.
