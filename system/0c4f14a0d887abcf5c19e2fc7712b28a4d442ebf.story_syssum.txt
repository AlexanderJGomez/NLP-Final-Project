(CNN)Most airline pilots have an above average ability to compartmentalize personal problems.
However, sometimes during the course of an airline pilot's career, or anyone's career for that matter, stress issues may manifest as depression.
He reportedly was administered a series of injections to mitigate his problems, an absolute reflection on the serious nature of his illness.
Lubitz's girlfriend made her concerns public knowledge -- unfortunately after events took their course.
Participation among the members of my club uncovers the personalities and idiosyncrasies of each pilot.
Second, Lubitz had to compete successfully in a selection process just to have the opportunity to train through Lufthansa's flight program, a requirement of Germanwings employment.
Countries that don't have the luxury of selecting from a large pool of experienced pilots use this license.
As with all of the MPL programs, the training involves an intense period of airline-specific instruction.
Using both actual flight experience in a single-engine airplane and simulator time, the student receives about 250 hours of training.
Once the primary training in Arizona was complete, Lubitz would have returned to Germany and completed more specific schooling on the Airbus A320 he was about to fly.
Over the course of a career, an airline pilot spends thousands of hours sharing the confined space of the cockpit with colleagues.
Apparently as late as March 20, Lufthansa pilots had been on strike, one of the main disputes being an early retirement option and less desirable working conditions for new hires.
Perhaps enough of a disparity existed for Germanwings pilots such that medical leave benefits would not have covered Lubitz's absence.
Well, this is the primary purpose of accident investigation: Never allow the same tragedy to occur again.
