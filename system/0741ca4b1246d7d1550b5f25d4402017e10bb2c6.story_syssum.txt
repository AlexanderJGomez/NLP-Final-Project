Of the 3,000 or so exhibitors here at CES, nearly 500 reside in the iLounge pavilion, a section dedicated specifically to Apple-related products.
The biggest reason for this is, of course, Apple's dominating presence in the consumer electronic space.
"Accessory makers can reach virtually the entire installed base of iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch owners with two products, determined by the connector," the 30 pin or Lightning, said Charles Govin, an industry analyst with Forrester.
"Similarly, a case maker must create many SKUs for the Android market, but essentially only three (iPhone 3G, 4, and 5) for the entire iPhone market."
In the three years since the iLounge Pavilion launched, the space has quadrupled to 120,000 square feet, all but taking over an entire hall and pushing the automotive industry into another space.
Meng said that it doesn't matter that Apple isn't at CES with a booth or keynote, because CES is already the most successful and popular show for companies like his.
Just Mobile already has eight products in the Apple Store and uses CES to expand into the international market and meet clients.
It's just there prerogative to not exhibit and they've found it more cost effective to host their own events," CEA spokeswoman Danielle Cassagnol said.
"They've never keynoted or exhibited at CES, so them not being here isn't really a loss for us."
