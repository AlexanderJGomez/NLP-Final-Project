Africa is now the fastest growing continent in the world, according a recent report from the African Development Bank.
"It's easy to talk about giving back but when the opportunity presents itself -- such as IBM Research Africa that allows you to create innovations in science and technology to begin to make a proper impact in the lives of more than a billion people -- I don't know what more can stop anybody," says Stewart.
Stewart went on to work in IBM's Services Innovation Lab -- an international program where he was responsible for the technical strategy at eight global facilities.
"All innovators in the continent of Africa should be problem centric," he says.
"What problems are we trying to solve and ask yourself, at the end, 'who is going to use it?'
Similar hubs have also mushroomed across the continent in recent years -- from Nigeria to Tanzania and Egypt to Madagascar.
"There is a tremendous potential for skill of impact when you innovate."
