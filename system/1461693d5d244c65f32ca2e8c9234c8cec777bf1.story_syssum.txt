From declining fertility rates and a growing proportion of divorcees, to an increasing awareness of social issues and taboo medical conditions -- it is claimed that the colorful dramas are responsible for a wave of 'social merchandising' that has helped significantly alter Brazilian values over the years.
This drop is of a similar scale to that seen in China, where the government has played an extensive and controversial role in controlling population numbers.
Joseph Potter, a University of Texas sociologist who has studied the relationship between fertility and television in Brazil explains in a report: "It's not a literate society, it's not a place where there are books and newspapers outside the upper 10 percent -- and television fills that space."
Finding opportunities to insert health themes into novelas is described by some in the industry as 'social merchandising' and its effects are quantifiably real.
Globo executive Luis Erlanger says that one episode, which featured a young girl in tears as her head is shaved in preparation for chemotherapy, prompted 23,000 bone marrow donations in the month after it first aired.
