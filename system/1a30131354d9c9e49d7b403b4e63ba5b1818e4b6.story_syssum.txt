ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN)  -- A suspected U.S. missile from an unmanned drone killed three people Saturday in Pakistan's tribal region, according to a Pakistani military source and a North Waziristan official.
Pakistan has repeatedly blamed the United States and condemned the strikes, saying they cost lives, violate the nation's sovereignty and undermine public support for its counterterrorism efforts.
On November 20, the ministry lodged a protest with Patterson against a strike in the Bannu region of Pakistan's North West Frontier Province that left five dead and seven wounded and was deeper inside Pakistani territory than previous attacks.
The United States is the only country operating in the region known have the capability to launch missiles from drones, which are controlled remotely.
