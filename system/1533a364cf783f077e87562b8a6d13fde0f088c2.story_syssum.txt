Not surprisingly, Greenblatt was diplomatic about the reboot from Warner Bros. TV and David E. Kelley (after all, the uber-producer is also the man behind Harry's Law, which earned a second season pickup).
"We did what was best for the schedule," Greenblatt continued.
Did Warner Bros. TV make a mistake by releasing early pictures of Palicki in the costume?
All that engagment from people whether it was positive or negative was good.
So maybe Wonder Woman will live to fight another day on the small screen (assuming you want to see it).
