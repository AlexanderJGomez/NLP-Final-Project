Square, which enables the virtual exchange of cash and goods, is designed to "give time back to our sellers, give time back to our merchants, so they can really focus on building their business up," Dorsey told CNN.
"What I think is great about technology, and every technology that exists, [is that] it increases the number of people who can participate, in our case commerce," Dorsey said.
"If you're not solving for the entire experience, you are putting those seams in front of the customers -- and the customers see that.
However, Dorsey said Square is an "entirely new canvas," dealing as it does with commerce rather than communication.
