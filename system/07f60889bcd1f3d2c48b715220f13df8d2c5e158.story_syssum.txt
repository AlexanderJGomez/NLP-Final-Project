(CNN)There's an old saying which states the Cape Verde Islands are home to a greater number of musicians per square kilometer than any other country in the world.
"Besides fish, it is pretty common (for Cape Verde) to say 'our biggest richness is in music and culture,'" said Christine Semba of Womex, an international networking platform for the world music genre.
Other elements of the creative economy include handicrafts, fashion and visual arts to name but a few.
According to Harold Taveres, a liaison to the mayor of Praia involved with promoting the festival, "KJF has become one of the most spectacular events in Cape Verde.
Yet in order to take full advantage of this bustling scene the country's ministry of culture, alongside some enterprising private sector figures, thought a deeper relationship with the music business was required.
He hopes that by exposing musicians to a range of experienced industry professionals and top-level musicians, they will become equipped with the tools and ambition to take the music of Cape Verde across the globe.
"Economically it's beneficial for the country because the money we would have to spend on the market to give the country this exposure in the world would be too big," Da Silva said.
It must be noted, however, that few countries have the same natural resources for music as Cape Verde.
