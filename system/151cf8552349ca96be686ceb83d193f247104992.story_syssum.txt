The boy's father, Okee Wade, 37, who has a lengthy arrest record, pleaded guilty in New Jersey Thursday to a charge of second-degree racketeering in connection with an elaborate bank fraud scheme.
Under the plea agreement, prosecutors will recommend a sentence of five years in state prison, but the judge warned that he faces up to 20 years if he fails to turn himself in.
An adviser to Myls' mother, Ashlee Dobson, said the father is welcome at the service "as long as he doesn't come and start anything."
A prosecutor told the court last week that King also was being investigated on suspicion of murder and faced additional charges.
In a statement last week, King's attorney, Bryan Konoski, said: "My client is not charged with homicide at this time and she is presumed to be innocent of allegations against her.
King told police that Myls' father dropped the child off for her to watch December 17 and that she was the "child's primary and sole caretaker" until the time of his death, the complaint said.
"And god forbid when they happen, it is our job to learn from them and try to every time do better so we can reach more children."
