The first Iraq war combat veteran to serve in the U.S. Senate introduced legislation on Thursday aimed at reducing the number of military veterans who commit suicide.
"Returning home from combat does not erase what happened there, and yet red tape and government dysfunction have blocked access to the care that saves lives.
The Suicide Prevention for America's Veterans Act is collaboration between Walsh and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.
Many times, five years is just not long enough for veterans who are dealing with the stigma of mental health issues.
The legislation also seeks to improve the quality of mental health care providers by making their jobs more competitive with the private sector, O'Gorman said.
The legislation would also try to streamline the way the Pentagon and the VA prescribe medication.
The bill was introduced the same week that Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America held its annual Storm the Hill initiative.
But the senator stressed that it will cost far more in years to come if changes are not made soon to improve mental health care.
The Iraq war lasted from 2003 to 2010 and Afghanistan has been raging since soon after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks.
The nonprofit think-tank RAND Corporation estimates a third of veterans likely have TBI, PTSD or depression, which puts the overall number affected at around 600,000.
Steve Bullock named Walsh, his lieutenant governor, to serve the remainder of Sen. Max Baucus' term after he became U.S. ambassador to China.
Speaking about a warrior under his command who had been deployed three times whose wife was left to care for triplets, Walsh said he understood that families have been under extreme stress for years.
The relatives have made "enormous sacrifices," he said.
