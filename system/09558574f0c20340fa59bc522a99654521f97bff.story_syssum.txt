(CNN) -- Its record on dealing with racist abuse has been mixed and now Russia has been urged by a leading anti-apartheid activist to show a tougher approach to the issue ahead of hosting the 2018 World Cup.
Jordaan, who began to campaign against apartheid in the 1970s, argued there should be "no compromise" on the issue of racism in football.
Earlier in November, the head of FIFA's disciplinary committee Claudio Sulser insisted the world governing body would deal with any racism at the World Cup.
Russia's 2018 Local Organizing Committee was not immediately available for comment.
