White smoke billowed from a building in the compound while heavily armed British and Afghan forces cordoned off the area in the center of the capital, establishing a security perimeter around the buildings.
In the first attack, a militant drove a vehicle packed with explosives toward the Council's main security gate before detonating the device, according to Afghan police spokesman Hashamap Stanikzai.
The British Council is a British government-affiliated body that fosters cultural and academic exchanges in Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, an embassy spokesman said British government personnel are coordinating with Afghan authorities to secure the area.
