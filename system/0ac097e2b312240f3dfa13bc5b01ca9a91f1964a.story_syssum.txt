To the Frenchman, a federal Europe was the natural progression of the bloc's newfound stability.
Fast forward to the present day and, though the EU does have some shared organs of government, like a commission and parliament, it certainly isn't the set of "united states" Monnet hoped for.

The bloc's borders have doubled with its endless absorption of former communist countries, stretching the definition of Europe to its limits, making membership to this formerly elite club appear more like a handy foreign policy tool rather than a cherished vision.
