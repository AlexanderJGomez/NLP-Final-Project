Her new book of photographs and essays, "The Oldest Living Things in the World," came out on Earth Day, April 22.
Before I got the idea for "The Oldest Living Things," I was searching for something I could really sink my teeth into.
Examples of this include the map lichens in Greenland that grow only 1 centimeter every 100 years, and the spruce tree on the cover of the book, which, despite its spindly appearance, has been growing clonally for 9,950 years.
This is a tough question, as I think we should weigh the environmental impact of our travels against the potential for cultural and personal enrichment.
I urge everyone to travel responsibly, and remember the Girl Scout motto to always leave a place in better shape than when you found it!
There is so much to see, know and do in the world, and I hope that we can all get out there -- in our own ways -- and do some good.
