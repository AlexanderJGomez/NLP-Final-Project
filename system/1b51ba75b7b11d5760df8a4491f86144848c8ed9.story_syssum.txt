(CNN) -- The United Nations is withdrawing international staffers from Syria for the time being after shelling near their living quarters, a spokesman said Monday.
The United Nations remains active and committed to helping the Syrian sides in their search for a political solution," Nesirky said.
The move comes amid alarm about the presence of chemical weaponry in the country and the wounding of a top rebel.
The United States has designated the al-Nusra Front as a terrorist organization linked to al Qaeda, but some rebels say they don't have a problem fighting alongside them against Bashar al-Assad's forces.
They are 90% Syrians and the rest may be from other Muslim countries," the rebel leader said in the video.
"We hope that the other countries reconsider their policies toward Syria and understand that there is no need to worry about the rise of terror in Syria," he added.
Moaz al-Khatib, the Syrian opposition leader, will be addressing the Arab League summit in Qatar this week "on behalf of the Syrian people," he said on the opposition Syrian National Coalition's Facebook page.
"This decision represents an important asset for the Syrian revolution, and a major step on the road to achieve to its goals," the coalition said on its website.
Last week, a Syrian opposition alliance elected Ghassan Hitto, who has studied and lived in the United States, to be prime minister of the opposition's interim government.
