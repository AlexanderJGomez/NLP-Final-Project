But in his life, 50-year-old Walter Scott was also the father of four children and served in the Coast Guard before being honorably discharged.
Another family lawyer, Chris Stewart, acknowledged that Scott had been arrested previously for outstanding warrants for not paying child support, but Stewart said that had been Scott's lone issue with the law for the past 20 years.
According to a police report, Scott did not comply with an officer's demands and tried to grab Slager's stun gun.
Regardless of why Walter Scott ran, "running from an officer doesn't result in the death penalty," Stewart said.
The last time the family got together with Walter Scott was when the siblings threw a surprise wedding anniversary party for their parents.
