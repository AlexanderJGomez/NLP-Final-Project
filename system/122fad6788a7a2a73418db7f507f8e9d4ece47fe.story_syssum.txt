Newtown shooter Adam Lanza was an isolated young man with deteriorating mental health and a fascination for mass violence whose problems were not ignored but misunderstood and mistreated, according to a report released Friday by a Connecticut state agency.
Six educators and the shooter's mother were also killed in the tragedy that shook the nation to its core and spurred a national debate over gun violence and mental health.
Despite sharing her worries about her son's condition with friends, the report said it does not appear Lanza's mother, Nancy Lanza, communicated any concerns to mental health or medical professionals in her final months.
Lanza was completely integrated into the regular classroom in fourth grade, and by fifth grade, Lanza transferred into a new school, the Reed Intermediate School for grades five and six.
It noted, however, that "teachers may have limited training or expertise to identify or respond to a student who may be progressing academically but who is also exhibiting difficulties in social emotional development" and urged additional training.
The report singled out a period of homebound education during which Lanza was taken out of school during his eighth-grade year as an especially dangerous health care decision that contributed to his isolation and deterioration.
"While we describe the predisposing factors and compounding stresses in [Lanza's] life, we do not conclude that they add up to an inevitable arc leading to mass murder," the report concluded.
