The comparison between smartphone data usage on Verizon's network and iPhone data usage on AT&T's network is important to note, because iPhone users have typically been viewed as the heaviest data users in the entire mobile market.
The fact that Verizon is seeing a major uptick in data usage in the past six months, largely due to new Android smartphones, could be a key predictor of wireless data usage patterns going forward.
With more Android devices coming on the market in the next few months, it's likely that the volume of Android smartphones on Verizon's network will increase.
Even though fewer Verizon cell phone subscribers are using data services, individually, they are consuming roughly the same amount of data each month as the average AT&T customer.
And about 47 percent of their iPhone subscribers use between 200MB and 2GB of data with about 90 percent of those customers using less than 1GB of data per month.
More than 11 percent of Verizon Wireless smartphone users fall into this category, versus just 5.6 percent of iPhone users.
In an effort to keep iPhone data usage in check so it doesn't completely overwhelm its network, AT&T recently eliminated its all you-can-eat data plan.
Company executives emphasized that point at the launch of the new Motorola Droid X earlier this summer.
According to the Validas report, a little more than 4 percent of Verizon's smartphone users consume more than 2GB of data per month compared with only about 2.5 percent of AT&T's iPhone customers.
Sales have been strong, but the company has suffered from component shortages making the devices hard to get.
But even with faster network speeds in some markets, Sprint and T-Mobile still lack the comprehensive coverage that AT&T and Verizon offer.
"People who travel tend to be more mobile, and they also tend to be power users when it comes to mobile data," Finegold said.
