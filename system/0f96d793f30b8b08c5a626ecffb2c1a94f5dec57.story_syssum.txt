The FCC had imposed a $550,000 fine against CBS and its affiliates for airing the "wardrobe malfunction" incident involving Jackson and Justin Timberlake during the professional football championship game's halftime show.
A three-judge Philadelphia-based 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals panel last November agreed, finding for a second time the FCC had acted "arbitrarily and capriciously," since the commission did not give the media companies proper prior warning about subsequent changes in its enforcement policies.
Congress quickly reacted at the time to the visual shocker by increasing the limit on indecency fines tenfold, up to $325,000 per violation per network.
The FCC claimed the network had "alarm bells" something might have been up, suggesting Jackson and Timberlake may have planned ripping off the woman's bustier, exposing her breast for nine-sixteenths of a second.
The "wardrobe malfunction" case is FCC v. CBS Corp. (11-1240).
