(CNN) -- An atheist sign criticizing Christianity that was erected alongside a Nativity scene was taken from the Legislative Building in Olympia, Washington, on Friday and later found in a ditch.
"Religion is but myth and superstition that hardens hearts and enslaves minds," the sign from the Freedom From Religion Foundation says in part.
Before reports of the placard's recovery, she said a temporary sign with the same message would be placed in the building's Rotunda.
Gaylor said that police are checking security cameras pointed at the building's entrances and exits to see if they can see anyone stealing the sign.
Barker said the display is especially important given that 25 percent of Washington state residents are unaffiliated with religion or do not believe in God.
"Most people think December is for Christians and view our signs as an intrusion, when actually it's the other way around," he said.
The placard is often turned around so the message can't be seen, and one year, someone threw acid on it, forcing the group to encase it in Plexiglas.
That ad has caused the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority to field hundreds of complaints, the group said, but it has heard just as much positive feedback, said Fred Edwords, the association's spokesman.
But the Christian Coalition of America is urging members to oppose the advertisements.
"Although a number of humanists and atheists continue to attempt to rid God and Christmas from the public square, the American people are overwhelmingly opposed to such efforts," Roberta Combs, the group's president said in a press release.
"But that doesn't mean that as governor, I have the right to deny their ability to express their free speech."
"They are shooting themselves in the foot," said iReport contributor Rich Phillips, who describes himself as an atheist.
"On that Nativity scene, there is this threat of internal violence if we don't submit to that master.
