Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Allied forces suffered a day of heavy losses in Afghanistan Friday after a helicopter crash killed six U.S. Marines and an attack killed four French soldiers, prompting Paris to consider an early troop withdrawal.
Sarkozy will send French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet to Afghanistan, he said.
Friday's suspected shooter, who was a member of the Afghan National Army, has been apprehended, according to an ISAF statement.
"This was the latest attack by those sensible and zealous Afghans who have entered the enemy's army and it was also the best one so far as it killed more soldiers than any other such attacks before,' Mujahid said.
"Such tragic incidents are terrible and grab headlines, but they are isolated," he said.
Friday's shooting was the latest in a series of attacks on NATO forces by members of the Afghan army.
Many ISAF members are involved in missions to train and support Afghan forces as they prepare to take on greater security responsibilities.
