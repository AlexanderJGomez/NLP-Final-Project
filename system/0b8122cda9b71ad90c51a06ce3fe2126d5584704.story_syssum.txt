(CNN) -- He travels in private jets and is one of the world's highest-paid athletes, but Fernando Alonso's humble beginnings are never far away from his thoughts.
Talking to CNN at an exhibition of memorabilia in Madrid documenting his illustrious career, the 32-year-old reflects on his early days in Oviedo -- a city in northwest Spain, in the province of Asturias.
Alonso showed promise from a young age, but his mother and father made it clear that the priority wasn't landing trophies.
With his family's support, Alonso flourished -- becoming a megastar who last year was rated 19th in Forbes' top-earning athletes list on $30 million, and is considered F1's most marketable driver.
And maybe that was the nice thing about that period of my career when I was a go-kart driver.
In 1998, he was runner-up at the European karting championships and two years later finished fourth in Formula 3000.
"There was a panic moment because I did not know what the neutral button was, and I was trying to find it.
Despite not tallying a single point in 2001, Alonso caught the eye and soon moved to Renault, where in 2005 at the age of 24 he became F1's youngest world champion -- a record since beaten by Lewis Hamilton and reigning titleholder Sebastian Vettel.
He repeated as world champion to emulate the likes of Ayrton Senna -- his hero.
This season Alonso is joined at the Italian team's Maranello headquarters by Kimi Raikkonen -- the last driver to win the championship for the Scuderia back in 2007.
"I think he's very talented so that is a huge help and huge motivation for myself first and also for the team because the team knows it has to deliver a good car because Kimi will deliver a good result," Alonso says.
I am hungry for victories, hungry for success -- I will tell you that two championships are not enough."
