It's been more than three weeks since his wife, a flight attendant on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, disappeared along with 238 others when the jet vanished mid-flight.
Without her, Lee says he's lost his direction.
Dozens of anguished relatives Sunday demanded that Malaysian authorities provide them with evidence of the fate of their loved ones aboard the missing Boeing 777.
Lee said he hears from Malaysia Airlines just once or twice a day, by phone or text message.
"The airline management only call us or have some briefing with us, you know, and then they tell us the same thing again as what the press conference told," he complained.
The waiting for the families has not been easy.
He wants something to tell his daughter, when she asks what happened to her mother.
