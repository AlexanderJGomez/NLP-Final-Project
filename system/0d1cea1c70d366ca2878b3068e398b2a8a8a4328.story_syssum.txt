During the rule of the Khmer Rouge, Cambodia's lush countryside was transformed by slave labor, starvation, fear and execution.
Once a high school in the middle of Cambodia's bustling capital city, Tuol Sleng was transformed by the Khmer Rouge into a prison and torture center.
Other prisoners were held for days and weeks at a time, packed in larger rooms and forced to lay motionless on the floor side by side.
Him Huy says he was in charge of receiving prisoners, both at Tuol Sleng and when they arrived at Choeung Ek.
After all the prisoners were led in, a group of us helped to guard and lead the prisoners to the ditches, where another group were waiting to kill the prisoners."
Some witnesses accuse Him Huy of taking an active role in the horrors at Tuol Sleng, including executing prisoners and separating infants and children from their mothers and sending them to slaughter.
So if someone was assigned to spy, they spied; if they were assigned to guard, they guarded."
