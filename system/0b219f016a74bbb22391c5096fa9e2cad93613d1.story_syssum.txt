(CNN) -- A major earthquake struck off Japan's northeastern coast Sunday, prompting tsunami advisories that were later canceled, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) said.
Tsunami advisories were issued -- and then canceled --for the coastal regions of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima.
The tsunami swamped the plant and knocked out cooling systems that kept the three operating reactors from overheating, leading to the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl.
"These kinds of aftershocks are likely to occur for some time."
