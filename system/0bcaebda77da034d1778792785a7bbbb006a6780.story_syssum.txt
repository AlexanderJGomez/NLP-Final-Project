Washington (CNN) -- Finding al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and rolling back a resurgent Taliban are necessary steps toward winning the war in Afghanistan, the top U.S. commander there told a Senate committee Tuesday.
"To pursue our core goal of defeating al Qaeda and preventing their return to Afghanistan, we must disrupt and degrade the Taliban's capacity, deny their access to the Afghan population, and strengthen the Afghan security forces," he said.
In August, the general had cautioned that a failure to reverse Taliban gains within 12 months could make defeating the insurgents impossible.
And Eikenberry, whose leaked cables to Washington indicated that he opposed sending large numbers of troops to the conflict, told the Senate he is "100 percent" behind the new strategy "with the refinement of the mission."
Both Eikenberry and McChrystal went out of their way to minimize the differences in their views after reports of an Eikenberry cable advising the president that McChrystal's plans to send more troops would be ill advised because of a lack of confidence in the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai.
Earlier, in his opening remarks, the general had said, "The mission is not only important, it is also achievable.
McChrystal said that the influx of additional troops should bring "significant progress" in the war by next summer, and by next December he should be able to "lay out progress" and show evidence of success in a report he will present.
"I see confidently in the summer of 2011 that beginning the reduction of forces will be appropriate, the pace and scope of which needs to be conditions-based on how strong is insurgency at that point."
The Pentagon announced 1,500 more Marines would be deploying this month as part of the new strategy.
