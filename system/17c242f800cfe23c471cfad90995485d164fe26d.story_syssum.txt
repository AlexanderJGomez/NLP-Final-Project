I began thinking this was something others might be experiencing when a friend (and mom of two) sent me a few screen shots of her old college friends talking about their "perfect" children in their status updates.
But regardless of what gets posted, the purpose of the blog has always been to highlight modern parenting trends while having a laugh.
For a long time, the majority of submissions came from nonparents, often people who worked with kids, like nannies, baby sitters and teachers.
But aside from that, I consider "overshare" anything a person probably should have kept to herself.
I've also heard from parents who say they read the blog because it makes them feel better about their own parenting!
The mom blogger community has unleashed some fury against me and the site, but even in those cases, I think it was just one segment of that community.
I've rarely received hate mail, fortunately, and I get a lot of nice e-mails from parents.
After all, you're behind a computer or on your phone, and you're almost tricked into thinking that what you post can simply be erased later.
Some people will even make art prints with their placentas to frame and hang in their homes.
It also includes a glossary of words you might encounter in modern parenting culture (like birth art, dipe and Nevaeh), and there are helpful pointers, lists and a quiz to help you determine if you overshare.
I see it as a way to connect and share relevant information, and I don't think a child's poop texture is of any relevance to people other than a child's parents.
For instance, I recently received a series of submissions about a "dog mom" who celebrated her dog's birthday and documented the whole shebang on Facebook, "tagging" him in every photo.
