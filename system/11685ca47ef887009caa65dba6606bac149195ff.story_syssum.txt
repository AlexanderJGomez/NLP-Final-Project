CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Hey, I'm Carl Azuz, reporting from Washington, D.C. this week where -- get this -- it is actually hotter than it is 500 miles south in Atlanta, Georgia at CNN's world headquarters!
I'm joined by my CNN Newsource colleague Karen Caifa, who's going to talk to us about what to eat to stay cool on the inside while you seek shade on the outside.
CAIFA: When the weather is hot and sticky, the foods you love may not seem as appetizing.
SCRITCHFIELD: Some of the nutrients that you get in dairy foods, you can actually get in vegetables.
Some can have more than a day's worth of sugar in just one bottle.
CAIFA: And you want to be sure you're not taking in too much caffeine and things like soda and things like iced coffee, because when it's really hot outside and you're working and you're running around, your heart rate can start racing really fast.
You know, there's a lot of sugar and there's a lot of fat in some ice cream, so you don't want to eat ice cream 24/7, seven days of the week.
Thanks so much for being with us on CNN Student News.
