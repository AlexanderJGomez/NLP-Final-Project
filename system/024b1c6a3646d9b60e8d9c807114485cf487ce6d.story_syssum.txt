Earlier this month, the same jurors took less than two hours to decide that Arias was "exceptionally cruel" in 2008 when she stabbed ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander 29 times, slit his neck from ear to ear and shot him in the face.
After jurors told Stephens they were stuck on Wednesday, the judge encouraged them to listen to each other, pinpoint areas of agreement and disagreement and ask for further guidance if they need it.
A path of heartbreak, violence, lies and confessions has led Arias to the Phoenix courtroom where her life is now in a jury's hands.
"I believe death is the ultimate freedom, so I'd rather just have my freedom as soon as I can get it," she told KSAZ shortly after her conviction.
Her life seemed to pass before her, as she delivered a slideshow presentation -- mostly of family photos -- to the jury on Tuesday.
It started off with pictures of her as a toddler wearing pigtails and showed several images from holidays and vacations with family members.
Arias pledged to make herself useful to other prisoners and humanity by performing acts of charity from behind bars, if spared.
She noted she could bring "people together in a constructive and positive way" by participating in various programs, including prisoner literacy initiatives; by her "Survivor" T-shirts, which would benefit victims of domestic violence; and by donating her hair, so it could be used to make wigs for sick children.
And so when we talk about that, it matters that she was 27 years old and she had no criminal history," she said.
Prosecutor Juan Martinez said pointing to Arias' artwork as evidence that her life should be spared wasn't a valid defense.
If Arias is given a sentence of death, she would be the fourth woman on death row in the state of Arizona.
After her arrest, Arias told an elaborate lie about masked intruders breaking into Alexander's house and killing him before she narrowly escaped.
Relatives who spoke with police described her as mentally unstable.
