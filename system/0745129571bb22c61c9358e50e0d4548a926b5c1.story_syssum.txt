The attack took place off a popular beach west of Auckland on Wednesday afternoon, police said, as people gathered there to enjoy the summer sunshine.
Mose said he believed at least two other sharks had joined in the frenzy around the body after a few minutes.
Auckland Council said it expected the area to remain closed for the next few days.
Others worried about the risk of more attacks.
