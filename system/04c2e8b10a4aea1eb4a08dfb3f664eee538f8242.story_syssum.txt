Substitute Fernando Torres completed the most unlikely of wins when he scored on the break in injury time to guarantee Chelsea's place in the final of Europe's top club competition for the second time in the English side's history.
"It is an incredible achievement by this group of players," said Chelsea coach Robeto di Matteo, who took over in early March on an interim basis when Andre Villas Boas was sacked.
Having come away from the first leg ahead due to Didier Drogba's goal, Chelsea traveled to the Camp Nou knowing Barcelona had won their last 15 home matches in the Champions League.
A minute after Terry departed, Iniesta looked to have set Barcelona on their way to the final when he finished off a trademark passing move with a precise, low shot into the far corner from Messi's through ball.
Barcelona had their own defensive reorganization to carry out when Gerard Pique came off after 25 minutes with a head injury to be replaced by Dani Alves, and the hosts were wide open at the back as Ramires skipped on to Frank Lampard's pass and expertly lifted the ball over the stranded Victor Valdes.
It still seemed only a matter of time before Barcelona got the crucial goal but as the minutes ticked down amid increasing desperation among the home fans, it began to look like fate was on Chelsea's side.
