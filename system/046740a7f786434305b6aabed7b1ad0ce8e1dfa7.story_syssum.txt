President Obama, who has been in office for five months, has been treading a careful line on Iran, which has seen two weeks of street demonstrations following a disputed presidential election there.
Pro-government security forces have cracked down on the protests, with officials saying 17 people have died.
Obama said Tuesday that Iran's government must justify itself not in the eyes of the United States, but in the opinion of its own people.
Ahmadinejad said Thursday that even 5- and 6-year-olds would not allow insults to the Iranian nation, telling Obama: "We hope that you will avoid interfering in Iran's affairs and somehow express your regret so that the Iranian nation can become aware of your regret.
If there is real change, the Iranian nation will welcome it."
