(CNN) -- The Middle East might account for less than one tenth of global private jet sales, but the passengers flying on the region's luxury planes can be the most demanding in the world.
Later this month Lufthansa Technik is set to flight test its first steam shower aboard a Boeing 737 -- not an easy job given the hazard of creating pressure and heat within the cabin.
Together Saudi Arabia and the UAE account for around 70% of the private jet market in the Middle East and North Africa, according to Middle East Business Aviation Association, but there are some clouds on the horizon for the charter companies.
One of the biggest problems they face in the region is the "gray market" -- planes owned by private individuals who then rent them out without having to go through the same regulatory scrutiny (or expense) of the charter companies.
This is one of the reasons companies like Royal Jet and Saudia Private Aviation are keen to highlight the safety and security of their planes and the experience of their pilots, as well as the level of service.
