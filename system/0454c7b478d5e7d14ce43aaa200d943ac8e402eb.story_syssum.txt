PARIS, France (CNN) -- The backstage gossip at recent fashion shows wouldn't be complete without rampant speculation about who is likely to replace esteemed American Vogue Editor in Chief Anna Wintour.
She told CNN she hadn't been offered the job and even if she was she probably wouldn't take it.
The film is based on a book penned by a former assistant at American Vogue who has denied suggestions Wintour was the inspiration for the demanding and odious lead character.
The best-selling edition so far, in August 2003, featured French actress Sophie Marceau on the cover smoking a cigarette.
Its circulation of some 139,000 is dwarfed by the million plus readers of American Vogue.
"Of course I would consider it because it would be ridiculous not to consider such a huge position -- in terms of money and in terms of power," she said.
I think it's not for me."
