Stacks of letters from around the country piled high.
While most were collecting money to help the survivors of the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis, I wanted to send something equally crucial to their recovery: hope.
The most touching letters came from the Gulf Coast where I'd grown up.
There were times when we thought that we would never have a normal life again," wrote a grandmother from Ocean Springs, Mississippi, where a storm surge similar in height to the tsunami had decimated nearly every building near the beach.
I looked up and smiled because I learned that after a storm, there is sunshine.
I'd planned to send the letters straight to Japan, but an industrious woman in Atlanta, Georgia, offered to translate them since not all Japanese speak English.
"I have been extremely frustrated being so far away from home and not being able to do anything to help the survivors of the earthquake, other than just sending money," e-mailed Virginia volunteer Sachiko Ide.
Carl Williams, coordinator of JACL relief efforts, sent photos of a group of school children he encountered in Iwaki City on the four-month anniversary of the tsunami praying at the shoreline near the site of their destroyed school.
Encouraged by the letter he received from "Words of Hope," the owner changed his mind and decided to re-open his business.
"She said my letter made her very strong and smile," said Deborah Kamp Clifton.
