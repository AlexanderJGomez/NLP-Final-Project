"Rabobank has come to this decision following publication of the report from the American doping authority USADA last week," its statement said.
Rabobank -- a century-old business which began its involvement in professional cycling 17 years ago "full of conviction and with a clear mission" -- had previously seen cycling as a good fit with the company, its clients and its employees, it said.
But a long chain of accusations trailing Armstrong has begun to erode support even among those who have steadfastly backed him in the past.
On Wednesday, Armstrong walked away from the chairmanship of the cancer charity he founded 15 years ago, Livestrong, saying he wanted to spare it any negative effects from the controversy surrounding him.
The USADA report is part of its request to international cycling officials to strip Armstrong of his seven Tour de France titles.
