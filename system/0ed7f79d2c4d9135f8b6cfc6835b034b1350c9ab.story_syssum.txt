Savoie chose his words carefully, lest police Officer Toshihiro Tanaka cut short the rare interview Savoie was granted with CNN on Thursday.
"I want Americans to know what's happening to me," Savoie continued in Japanese.
They have charged Savoie, 38, a Tennessee native and naturalized Japanese citizen, with kidnapping his two children -- 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca -- as his estranged wife, Noriko, was walking them to school Monday in Yanagawa, a rural town in southern Japan.
He headed for the nearest U.S. consulate, in the city of Fukuoka, to try to obtain passports for the children, screaming at the guards to let him in the compound.
Japanese law, however, recognizes Noriko Savoie as the primary custodian, regardless of the U.S. court order.
Complicating the matter further is the fact that the couple is still considered married in Japan, because they never divorced there, police said Wednesday.
If a child in Japan is taken against the wishes of the recognized Japanese parent, the person who took the child is considered an abductor.
But most have not heard of the case, because it has not been reported in local newspapers or on television.
Savoie, a law student who already has a Ph.D. and a M.D., will spend 10 days in jail while Japanese prosecutors sort out the details of the case.
He glanced over at the police officer, then paused to regain composure.
Moments earlier, the interview had almost ended after Savoie blurted out in English: "I love you," a message intended for his current wife, Amy, in Nashville.
