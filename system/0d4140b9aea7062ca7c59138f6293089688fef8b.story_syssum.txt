That's when it kind of hit me that there was no place for women to go for a great blowout in a great space.
With over 2,000 stylists I can't do it myself anymore but I train a team that does it so I'll do a lot of demos for them too, which I love, to get my hands back in hair because I have such a strong passion for hair.
I've had stylists ask me if they should cover up their tattoos, and I was like noooo, we want to see them!
W: I get my kids off to school that's first and foremost, I'm usually at my office for a little while and I'm usually based in LA so I try to hit as many LA stores as I can.
I do work in the office a lot too because we have so much going on there but I really try to get out in the field and make surprise visits just so I can see what's going on, stay connected, get a blowout, whatever.
W: It's funny when we were coming up with the bar menu, it was so fun naming all the hairstyles after drinks and I thought how fun would it be to be sitting here and say I'll have the Manhattan or I'll have the Cosmo.
