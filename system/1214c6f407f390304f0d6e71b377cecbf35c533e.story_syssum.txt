(CNN) -- Allies of Philippines President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on Wednesday defeated an attempt by opposition leaders to impeach her on large-scale corruption charges -- the fourth such attempt in four years.
"I'm not saying that there is no substance (to the complaint), but it was insufficient," Deputy House Speaker Pablo Garcia told the committee before the vote.
During the vote count, Arroyo was tape-recorded talking to a senior election official, which opposition leaders charge is evidence she manipulated the outcome.
The opposition then tried to impeach Arroyo in 2006 and 2007 -- and Congress dismissed those attempts as well.
