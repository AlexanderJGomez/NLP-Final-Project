One of CNN's resident experts is producer Mohammed Tawfeeq, who was in Baghdad when President George W. Bush dodged a flying shoe at news conference in the U.S. Embassy in December 2008.
The act of throwing a shoe at someone or showing them your sole is "incredibly offensive" in the Middle East, he said.
"Throwing a shoe or hitting someone with a shoe or showing the bottom of your shoe when sitting with legs up on a chair and facing another person all are culturally unacceptable and are considered to be a grave insult and belittling to a person," Shirazi said.
"The head carries a more prestigious status in comparison to the feet, which in older times mostly remained bare."
