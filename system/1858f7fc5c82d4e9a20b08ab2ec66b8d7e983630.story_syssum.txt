(CNN) -- A former campaign staffer for San Diego Mayor Bob Filner became the second woman to publicly accuse him of sexual harassment, saying Tuesday that the then-congressman patted her "posterior" while at a fundraising event.
"I had to work and do my job in an atmosphere where women were viewed by Mayor Filner as sexual objects or stupid idiots," Jackson said.
At one point, she said, someone at the event told Filner that Fink had "worked her ass off" for him.
A few days later, KPBS reported, Filner mumbled "I'm sorry" but told her she didn't understand what happened.
But he has also acknowledged, "I need help," and added, "I'm clearly doing something wrong."
Filner "laughed it off," she said.
She said Filner challenged her to provide one example of improper behavior; when she brought up his comments about wearing underwear, "he had no comeback," she said.
