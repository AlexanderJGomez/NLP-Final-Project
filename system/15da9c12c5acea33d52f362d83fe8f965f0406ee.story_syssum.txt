Asked which school meals were their favorites, students at a public school in the New York borough of Queens don't say chicken fingers or meatballs.
The school of nearly 400 students, from pre-kindergarten to third grade, was founded five years ago on the principle that a healthy lifestyle leads to strong academic achievement.
Active Learning's student body may be more accustomed to vegetarian diets than most, with 85% of the students being Asian and another 10% Hispanic, said Margie Feinberg, spokeswoman for the New York Department of Education.
Other options might include roasted chickpeas, vegetarian chili and brown rice, or falafel, the city Department of Education said in a statement.
Following the announcement this week, Groff said he was welcomed into a PTA meeting with roaring applause.
He hired a school parent as a vegetarian chef to develop the menu and described his school as the vegetarian test kitchen for the city.
