Pakistani Taliban spokesman Azam Tariq told CNN by phone that only one Taliban fighter had been killed and three injured in that time.
It has prompted the exodus of tens of thousands of civilians, the U.N. refugee agency said.
"In some areas, people (including women) raised white flags; they were left off after search," Pakistan said in a statement.
The ground offensive in South Waziristan was launched Saturday morning after the military received clearance from the government, said Gen. Athar Abbas, the Pakistan military spokesman.
But the government doesn't want help from U.S. drones, he said.
When militants lay down their arms and surrender, "only then it will be accepted you are not fighting," he said.
The latest attack occurred Friday in the northern city of Peshawar, when a suicide car bomber detonated near a police station, killing 13 people -- most of them civilians.
On Thursday, U.S. President Barack Obama approved an additional $7.5 billion in assistance to Pakistan over the next five years.
