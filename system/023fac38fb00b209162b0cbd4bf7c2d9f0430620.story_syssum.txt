Obama touts that the stimulus bill will help create up to a half a million so-called "green" jobs in the field of alternative energy.
Noronha says AVA Solar needs two things: Government loans to expand its factory, and more government assistance to help power companies commit to building large solar power plants in the United States.
Without the stimulus, Noronha said, AVA Solar is on track to create 420 new jobs by the end of this year.
"What everybody needs is a little seed money because five years from now there's no question [that] solar has to replace the oil that we import," Noronha says.
"As a company we would very much like to have customers here in the U.S.," Noronha says.
"If you look at the vision of the president, you know he is looking out in the future and saying we've got to reduce our dependence on foreign oil," Noronha says.
