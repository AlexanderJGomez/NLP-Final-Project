Rick Remender: I had been writing Steve Rogers for a little bit; he's this kid raised in the Great Depression, and I wanted to explore that.
He'd have a more modern sensibility and be able to speak to an audience the way Steve Rogers wouldn't be able to, so we started building the story from there.
He wants to stand up and put himself between the forces of evil and corruption and things that would harm the everyday citizen.
Since he is incapable of serving as Captain America, he will be at the Avengers mansion at the command station.
If it helps one kid feel a part of something and makes them feel that they are reflected in their heroes ... that's a wonderful byproduct that will hopefully have more positive effects than just being an exciting superhero comic.
Remender: When I proposed it originally, it was seen as "You can't do it unless it's going to be a long-term change."
Hydra has already won before Sam realizes that they're up to something.
