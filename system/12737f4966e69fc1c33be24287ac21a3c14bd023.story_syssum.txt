The 19-year-old's family told CNN Tuesday that he had no ties with the Mossad, Israel's spy agency, and had, in fact, been recruited by ISIS.
His father tried to help him get home, sending him money and even enlisting the Red Cross.
A video posted Tuesday on ISIS-affiliated social media accounts shows a man who appears to be Musallam on his knees, wearing an orange jumpsuit.
The child steps in front of the man and raises what appears to be a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and shoots Musallam in the forehead.
But he refuses to show the video to his parents, who still can't believe their son is dead.
Musallam's family members said they believe he was coerced in the video, forced to lie about ties to Israeli intelligence.
The boy then stands over one of the bodies, fires two more times, and later raises his pistol high.
Human Rights Watch says ISIS and other extremist groups "have specifically recruited children through free schooling campaigns that include weapons training and have given them dangerous tasks, including suicide bombing missions."
