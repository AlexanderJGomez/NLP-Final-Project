Katherine Jackson watched from the front row as her lawyer questioned AEG Live Senior Vice President and General Counsel Shawn Trell about an e-mail exchange with his boss at parent company AEG.
Panish then showed jurors an e-mail Trell sent on January 28, 2009, to Ted Fikre, AEG's chief legal officer, letting him know he was about to go to Jackson's home for the signing of the contract for his "This Is It" concert tour.
Interesting for sure, but kind of creepy."
The e-mail exchange happened less than four hours before Trell and other AEG executives visited Jackson's Los Angeles home.
The coroner ruled that Jackson died from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol, which Murray told police he was using to treat the singer's insomnia.
Panish -- the Jackson family's lead lawyer -- questioned Trell Thursday about his previous testimony that there were no "red flags" to alert AEG executives about Jackson's declining health.
When Panish suggested Prince had not had "a very favorable experience" with AEG, Trell said he'd not spoken to him about it.
