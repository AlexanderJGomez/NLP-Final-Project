Washington (CNN) -- An Air Force officer who had been in charge of a military unit aimed at preventing sexual assaults made an initial court appearance Thursday on a sexual battery charge but did not enter a plea.
After taking the position with the sexual assault prevention unit in February, he underwent training aimed at preparing him for his duties, Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. John Dorrian said.
Commonwealth's Attorney Theo Stamos said that her office has "routinely prosecuted members of the military" and would do so in this instance as well.
President Barack Obama has said he will not tolerate such conduct and urged the Pentagon to step up its prevention efforts.
