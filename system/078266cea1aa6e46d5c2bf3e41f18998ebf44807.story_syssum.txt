"In recent days, it has become clear that our systems to identify and remove hate speech have failed to work as effectively as we would like, particularly around issues of gender-based hate," Marne Levine, a Facebook vice president in charge of public policy, wrote in a post on the site.
We have been working over the past several months to improve our systems to respond to reports of violations, but the guidelines used by these systems have failed to capture all the content that violates our standards.
"It is because Facebook has committed to having policies to address these issues that we felt it was necessary to take these actions and press for that commitment to fully recognize how the real world safety gap experienced by women globally is dynamically related to our online lives," author Soraya Chemaly, who helped spearhead the effort, said in a post on the group's site.
Such issues have come up repeatedly in the past, notably when Facebook users created fan pages celebrating accused Colorado theater shooter James Holmes or Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.
"These pages and images are approved by your moderators, while you regularly remove content such as pictures of women breastfeeding, women post-mastectomy and artistic representations of women's bodies," read the letter, signed by dozens of women's groups from around the world.
On Twitter, supporters posted violent images they said were originally shared on Facebook pages.
While many of the roughly 300 comments Wednesday morning thanked the site, others suggested it wasn't enough or speculated that it wouldn't have happened without pressure from advertisers.
"We need to make sure FB follows up on this."
