(CNN) -- Media magnate Rupert Murdoch will meet journalists at his News International subsidiary in London Friday, to take charge of the crisis surrounding the embattled Sun newspaper, with some speculating whether he will "sacrifice" UK staff to prevent the controversy from spilling across the Atlantic.
Such actions could put broadcast operations, the most profitable part of the News Corp. operations, in jeopardy, said Porter Bibb of Mediatech Capital Partners in New York.
"It's really ironic that the greatest threat to freedom of the press in Great Britain today, and around the world today perhaps, has come from Rupert Murdoch because of his excesses," said Carl Bernstein, the Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist who, along with Bob Woodward, broke the Watergate series of stories that eventually led to the resignation of U.S. President Richard Nixon.
The phone-hacking scandal prompted Murdoch's son, News Corp. executive James Murdoch, to shut down News of the World in July.
While Murdoch started in newspapers, the UK division of his News Corp. empire -- which includes movie studio 20th Century Fox, the Fox Broadcasting Company and Harper Collins Publishers -- is only a $1.6 billion slice of the $32 billion empire.
The arrests of journalists have spread alarm, and prompted an editorial by the Sun that police dawn raids against its journalists were part of a "witch-hunt" that had left Britain behind former Soviet states on press freedom.
"This is a system that Rupert Murdoch set up, these are his values that the Sun has practiced, let's not kid ourselves about it any more than the atmosphere in the Nixon White House was about his aids and underlings," Bernstein said.
You've got to destroy the competition," said Neil, who worked with Murdoch for 11 years.
But at the same time, these bums ought to be protected along with those who practice real journalism.
