(CNN) -- A politically active Marine who has questioned President Barack Obama's authority said Thursday that he is facing administrative discharge proceedings over his comments.
He later clarified to say he meant illegal orders, which he has explained as orders such as sending the military to Syria without congressional approval.
While the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects the free speech rights of ordinary citizens, a Defense Department rule prohibits service members from engaging in some forms of political activity.
The Facebook page notes that it does not represent and is not affiliated with the military or government.
"Like it or not Obama is the Commander in Chief and this Marines job is to protect him Right or wrong," another poster said.
Lakin argued that Obama was not born in the United States and therefore was not legally president, making his orders illegal.
