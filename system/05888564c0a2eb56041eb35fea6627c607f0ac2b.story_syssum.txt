World outrage grew Saturday as details emerged about an attack in the Syrian village of Houla, which left more than 90 people dead, including nearly three dozen children, according to the United Nations.
Observers confirmed the use of artillery and tank shells, Mood said.
Syrian state media reported the observers' visits Saturday to several towns and cities and blamed al Qaeda-linked groups for the deaths in Houla.
"We call on our fighters, the soldiers and the revolutionaries, to conduct organized and planned military strikes against Assad battalions and regime members," Brig.
"This barbaric act was preceded by the regime's mortar shelling in the town," the LCC said in a statement.
"This appalling and brutal crime involving indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force is a flagrant violation of international law and of the commitments of the Syrian government to cease the use of heavy weapons in population centers and violence in all its forms," the joint statement said.
"And the United States will work with the international community to intensify our pressure on (Syrian President Bashar al-Assad) and his cronies, whose rule by murder and fear must come to an end."
In a letter to the head of the U.N. Security Council, obtained by CNN, Ban said he is deeply concerned that the Syrian violence has not stopped despite the presence of the monitors and the agreement by both sides to a peace plan.
Meanwhile, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) said that "al-Qaeda-linked terrorist groups" massacred a couple and their six sons and a father and son in the rural village of al-Shumariyeh village in the Homs province.
The terror group also sabotaged the National Hospital in the area and attacked a law enforcement headquarters, SANA said.
