Tomioka, Japan (CNN) -- As we travel down the road toward the 20-kilometer (12-mile) exclusion zone, the entryway is blocked by half a dozen police officers and a large sign flashing red lights.
It's hard to imagine that many people once lived here, as we drive into the center of town.
Cars sit in a shopping center, seemingly waiting to have groceries loaded into them.
They stare at us, the visitors, and then return to grazing, as we drive off.
The surface reader begins to climb, as soon as we drive past the entryway, even though I haven't placed it next to a contaminated surface, which residents hope will be decontaminated within a few years.
Not a significant problem since we're in the exclusion zone for a short visit and wearing protective suits.
But the rest of Tomioka sits empty, of people, of progress and an apparent future.
