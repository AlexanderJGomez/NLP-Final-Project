Beijing (CNN) -- A day before the Nobel committee honors an imprisoned Chinese dissident with its peace prize, China ratched up the rhetoric calling the award "an interference" in its internal affairs.
Officials have repeatedly called Liu Xiaobo -- currently serving an 11-year sentence for "inciting subversion" -- a common criminal and the award a Western plot against China.
It is unclear, officially, how China's stance has affected nations who have said they are not attending the award ceremony.
The U.N. was not formally invited and usually does not attend the ceremony unless someone from the organization wins the award, the official said.
Labeed Abawi, Iraq's deputy foreign affairs minister, said officials had not yet decided if they would attend the ceremony.
