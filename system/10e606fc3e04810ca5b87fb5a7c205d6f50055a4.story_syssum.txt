Morales made the remarks in a speech in a remote part of Bolivia, carried on national television and radio stations.
He would not say how many agents are in Bolivia for security reasons but said it was not a significant presence.
The violence broke out in September as Morales, the nation's first Indian president, battled an autonomy movement in the natural gas-rich eastern departments of Santa Cruz, Pando, Beni and Tarija.
In late October, Bolivia's Congress approved an agreement between the government and opposition leaders to hold a referendum on a constitution that would grant more power to the nation's Indian majority, according to the Bolivian Information Agency, or ABI, the state news agency.
