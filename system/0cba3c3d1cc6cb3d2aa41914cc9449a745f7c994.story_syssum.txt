"Moving on from the Army has been a really tough decision," he said in a statement released Tuesday.
The younger son of Prince Charles and Princess Diana seemed to thrive in a military setting.
He'll spend the last two months of his operational service attached to Australian Defence Force units in Darwin, Perth and Sydney.
He helped spearhead and continues to champion the Invictus Games, a competition for former military personnel who have been wounded in the line of duty.
And he will undertake an official Royal tour of New Zealand in May, after his service with the Australian Defence Force is complete.
The next steps would be staff college and desk jobs and that's not for him.
