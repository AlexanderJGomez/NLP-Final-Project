(CNN)Feidin Santana, the man who recorded a South Carolina police officer fatally shooting a fleeing, unarmed man, told CNN on Thursday night he was told by another cop to stop using his phone to capture the incident.
Santana said when he first came on the scene while walking to his job he saw Slager on top of Scott, who was on the ground.
Neither the struggle nor the use of a Taser was captured on video, because Santana had yet to begin recording.
When Santana's video begins, Scott starts running away from the officer, with Scott's back to Slager.
Scott's mother, Judy Scott, told Cooper this week that she would want to thank Santana for coming forward.
Judy Scott said she couldn't watch the whole recording.
But ... if I wouldn't show my face, everybody over there knows, including the police, who I am," Santana said.
In the last half of the video, a second officer appears to examine Scott with gloved hands.
