The study found that approximately 8% of third-grade students had at some point in their lives engaged in non-suicidal self-injury.
First, I am surprised that, before this study, most people assumed that children wouldn't engage in a behavior that is so common in teenagers and young adults.
This leads directly to the second thing that surprises me: that children below the age of puberty are considerably less likely to deliberately harm themselves than are adolescents or young adults.
This finding is consistent with a lot of literature showing that children have far lower rates of mood, anxiety and psychotic disorders than adults do.
I could fill pages with various theories, but I can't give a one- or two-sentence answer that encapsulates this unquestionable truth.
This is more often the case with women and usually involves cutting the skin, although I've treated patients over the years who were addicted to other types of self-damaging behavior, such as hitting themselves in the face or inserting sharp objects into various bodily orifices.
You'd think that people who recurrently injured themselves would be at increased risk of committing suicide, but this is far from clear.
On the other hand, most completed suicides occur in men, and the risk rises sharply with age.
Our growing understanding of this fact has led to a proposal by the American Psychiatric Association that non-suicidal self-injury be given its own diagnostic category in the next edition of the DSM, which is the "bible of psychiatric diagnoses" in the U.S.
Although the last thing psychiatry needs in general is another diagnostic category, the upside of this proposal is that it makes official something many patients have been trying to tell us for years: that their apparent suicidal behavior is not really motivated by an urge to kill themselves.
