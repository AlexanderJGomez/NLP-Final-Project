The results of the assessment were revealed in court Monday when the Olympic sprinter's trial resumed after a monthlong break for the evaluation.
The state says Pistorius argued with Steenkamp before killing her.
But Masipa ordered the evaluation, saying the defense's act of putting a psychiatrist on the stand had raised the question of the athlete's mental health.
Versfeld described the limitations of Pistorius' mobility, based on his examination of the athlete and Pistorius' own description.
He said he had been too scared to turn the lights on.
"The moment there is light available, he will be able to use his vision to balance," Versfeld said, agreeing that if Pistorius had known the objects in his room, that would also have helped protect him from falling.
If she does not believe the athlete thought there was an intruder, she will find him guilty of murder and sentence him to at least 15 years in prison and possibly life.
A verdict of culpable homicide would leave the sentence at Masipa's discretion.
