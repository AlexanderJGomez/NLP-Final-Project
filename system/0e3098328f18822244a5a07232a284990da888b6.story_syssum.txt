The Serbia international has ruptured cruciate ligaments in his knee, and manager Alex Ferguson said the 30-year-old will see a specialist on Monday to reveal the full extent of the injury.
"He'll see a specialist on Monday to work out the progress of when he has the operation," confirmed Ferguson.
Vidic is part of a growing injury list at Old Trafford, with Mexico striker Javier Hernandez also sidelined after damaging an ankle during last week's 1-0 win over Aston Villa.
However, Bulgarian striker Dimitar Berbatov could return for Saturday's clash with Mick McCarthy's 16th-placed Wolves.
