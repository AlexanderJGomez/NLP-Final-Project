London, England (CNN) -- Police in London have reached a settlement with the family of Jean Charles de Menezes, whom officers shot dead in 2005, mistaking him for a suicide bomber.
They also found that de Menezes did not advance toward armed officers on the subway train, which would have given them a reason to shoot.
They returned an open verdict in the case, meaning the jury was unable to establish a cause of death.
Officers staking out a home in south London saw and followed de Menezes, 27, believing he was one of the suspects.
The shooting was one of several issues that led to the resignation last year of Police Commissioner Ian Blair.
