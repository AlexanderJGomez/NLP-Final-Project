We learned that in high school, "for no reason whatever," as his father put it, Alex always wore white T-shirts and blue jeans, and that one day some 400 to 500 kids from the school wore the same outfit, declaring an unofficial "Alex Teves Day."
Teves had something to say to the news media, too, something impossible to ignore: "And if we don't stop talking about the gunman -- so somebody took a gun and went in and shot a 6-year-old girl?
What we're going to say is: A coward walked into a movie theater and started shooting people.
The mass killings certainly dominated the news, quickly becoming one of the biggest stories of 2012.
James Holmes' face, meanwhile, made it to a number of front pages in the wake of the massacre, as shown in Newseum's Today's Front Page feature, but not as often or as large as you might think.
Nor do we have an idea if some sort of media blackout about them would have any effect in preventing this type of incident from occurring again.
I just search for "people running on baseball fields" on Google and up popped recent incidents in 10 cities, all recorded on cell phones, as well as two websites that collects such videos.
And to the extent that it can address such big questions, news organizations should make the necessary inquiries -- dig into the suspect's past, find indicators of questionable behavior, look for signs of terrifying intent.
In the chance that being on television and across the front pages could be a draw to killers, the news media must err on the side of caution in its coverage.
Still, when something like this happens, we are, as a society, like a tribe discussing the events around the campfire.
Here, too, we have questions: Who is this killer?
