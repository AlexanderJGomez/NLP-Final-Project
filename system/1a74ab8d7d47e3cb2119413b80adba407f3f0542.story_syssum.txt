Over the last week, thousands seeking free medical care have turned up at the mobile health care clinic set up by Remote Area Medical, a non-profit organization founded by Brock.
Remote Area Medical, better known as RAM, is a volunteer organization that brings free medical, dental and vision care to people around the world.
On the final day of the Los Angeles operation, Brock said crowds were still gathering with the hope of receiving care.
That includes the extraction of nearly 1,800 bad teeth and the production of 1,090 pairs of new eyeglasses.
The organization has been besieged for requests from a number of metro areas, including Detroit, Seattle, Miami and Atlanta, Brock said.
Unfortunately, he said, other states don't have similar provisions, making it difficult for RAM to recruit enough local volunteers to be able to deal with the demand if they were to set up in areas like New York or Washington.
But it's a rewarding experience for volunteers when they get to see how much their efforts have been appreciated, he said.
