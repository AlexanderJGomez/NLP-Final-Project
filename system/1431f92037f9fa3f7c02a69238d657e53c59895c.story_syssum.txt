San Francisco (CNN) -- When Microsoft released the first Xbox nearly a decade ago, analysts considered the then-money-losing endeavor to be a sort of Trojan horse into the living room: a bid to become the home's central media hub.
Video Unlimited will deploy a new patented search interface that works well with the arrow buttons on remote controls, which typically don't have keyboards, and the system suggests results as the user types -- much like Google's predictive search results.
For now, the PlayStation Network Store will continue to offer the same programming that Video Unlimited has, to cater to customers familiar with buying media through the existing store.
The redesigned video service will be coming to Sony set-top boxes and Bravia TVs in the next few months, Aragon said.
In the interview, Aragon boasted that Sony has added 3 million accounts and usage has increased by more than 10% since the outage.
Even with more TV sets bundling Internet capabilities, the market for set-top boxes is expected to grow 14% this year to 21 million devices shipped, according to market research firm In-Stat.
Microsoft plans to launch new video-on-demand and live TV services for Xbox in partnership with dozens of media companies, he said.
While Sony is optimizing its platform for existing remotes with the unique search feature, Microsoft is promoting the Kinect, with its microphone and camera for motion sensing, as the peripheral for navigating video content.
Sony favors a la carte over "the Netflix model," Aragon said, because it can offer new films close to when they are released on Blu-ray.
Subscriptions are thriving, evidenced by Netflix's success and by Amazon.com's partnership with 20th Century Fox, announced Monday, for the Instant Videos service.
But if their gaming consoles were truly home-entertainment Trojan horses, the clock is ticking for them to spring their surprise.
