These rumors may have been spawned by glimpses of as-yet unfinished prototypes which may never come to market; they could be complete fiction.
The interesting thing about all these rumors is that each one suggests Apple is more concerned than ever about competing with Android devices, many of which feature huge screens, massive cameras and physical keyboards already.
Now, the iPhone 5 is rumored to have a camera between 8 megapixels (competitive with current Android phones) and 12 megapixels (blowing most current Android models out of the water and likely keeping pace with future Androids, too).
But the enterprise isn't a market Apple has typically courted in the past; to do so now, we suspect they'd have to have a virtual keyboard option alongside a physical keyboard option -- an extremely atypical move for the company.
