Cairo (CNN) -- Nine people died over two days in clashes between Egyptian police and protesters amid reports of inadequate security at a soccer match that devolved into a riot in which 79 fans were killed, officials said Friday.
In the Sumoha neighborhood of Alexandria, thousands of protesters clashed with police, throwing Molotov cocktails and rocks and setting tires afire, said Tamer Mohamed, an activist who witnessed events there.
Police fired tear gas into the crowds and warning shots into the air, he said.
Among the people arrested in Cairo were 12 Syrians, said Maj. Karim El-Fouli with the Egyptian police.
Outside the police station, about 100 other Syrians demanded their countrymen's release.
The statement continued, "The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has always reiterated to the military forces that peaceful protests are a right to all people to state their demands."
In the aftermath, horrified fans questioned why police had not stopped the Al-Masry fans from rushing the visitors' stands, why exits were barred and how fans were able to take weapons into the stadium.
"I'm sure there are some hidden hands behind this, but we cannot really see, or we cannot really confirm, who is behind all that."
"There were organized groups in the crowds that purposely provoked the police all through the match and escalated the violence and stormed onto the field after the final whistle," he said.
Egypt's fledgling parliament erupted in anger over the national tragedy Thursday, with the debate growing so heated that the body's speaker ordered a live broadcast of the session cut off.
The governor and the chief of security, along with the head of the Port Said football federation, the stadium manager and the riot police chief, have all been banned from travel until the investigation is completed.
