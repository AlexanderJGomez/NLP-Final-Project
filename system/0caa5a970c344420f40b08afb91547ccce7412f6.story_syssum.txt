(CNN) -- A jet lagged Serena Williams skipped any New Year celebrations for a good night's sleep after starting her 2014 WTA campaign in Brisbane Tuesday with a win over Andrea Petkovic.
But she quickly recovered and also made inroads on the Petkovic service, as well as sending down 11 aces of her own.
Williams will next play ninth seed Dominika Cibulkova, who had to battle for two hours 14 minutes to beat 43-year-old Japanese veteran Kimiko Date-Krumm, 6-3 1-6 6-3.
Despite her desire for some shut eye, Williams will be hoping to have got back to more regular sleep patterns after only flying into Australia Saturday ahead of the tournament.
In other matches Tuesday, fourth seed Jelena Jankovic beat Elina Svitolina, 6-1 6-3 and Kanepi saw off eighth seed Carla Suarez Navarro 6-2 6-2.
