With the sound of waves playing in the background and the sand-like mound of salt underfoot, the place could easily be mistaken for an exotic snow beach.
The treatment is widely used in Eastern Europe and Russia, where people with chronic breathing disorders often spend two to three hours per day in underground salt grottos.
In 2006, the New England Journal of Medicine published a study on patients with cystic fibrosis who used this kind of saline therapy for 48 weeks.
Familiar with such treatments in her hometown, Sofia Benke from Hungary was therefore surprised when she moved to the UK two years ago and discovered there were no salt caves in the country.
I had heard so many stories of how salt caves had treated friends' problems, so I decided to open one in London," the 30-year-old told CNN.
Ideally, treatment lasts one to two weeks and patients need to be in the cave for one to two hours every day, Benke says.
Dr Elaine Vickers of Asthma UK, said: "It's currently impossible for us to say whether or not salt caves are beneficial for people with asthma.
The reason for this is because their symptoms were no longer present after undergoing salt therapy, she said.
