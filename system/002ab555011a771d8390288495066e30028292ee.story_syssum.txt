(InStyle.com) -- Singer Carrie Underwood dishes on dieting, beauty and fashion.
Somebody, somewhere, will catch you, even if it's a fan at the grocery store.
I count calories, fat and fiber--which is important in making you feel fuller faster--and protein, especially when I'm working out.
Oh, jeez, I'm thinking about it now...
I like the elliptical machine or swimming if I'm in a hotel with a decent pool and there aren't too many people there.
Plus, I get a decent cardio workout every night onstage.
I don't do smelly soaps or wear perfume, so lotion is kind of my perfume.
It's got a little shimmer in it.
So I'll put something shimmery on top.
But it all comes together.
I tend to go after bigger, flowy tops or dresses.
