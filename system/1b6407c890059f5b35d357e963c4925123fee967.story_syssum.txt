The space agency scrubbed Thursday morning's test launch in Florida after a series of delays, the last of which happened because some liquid-oxygen fuel and drain valves failed to open during the countdown, NASA said.
The first delay involved a boat that came too close to the launch area; more delays came because of wind gusts.
When it becomes fully operational, Orion's crew module will be able to carry four people on a 21-day mission into deep space or six astronauts for shorter missions.
By comparison, the Apollo crew modules held three astronauts and were in space for six to 12 days.
Once in orbit, Orion should send back some amazing pictures of Earth, NASA said.
A Tyrannosaurus rex fossil from the Denver Science Museum will be on board and lockers will be filled with flags, coins, patches, poetry and music.
