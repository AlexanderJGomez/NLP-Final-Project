But the full story of Thursday's gruesome beheading at an Oklahoma food processing plant -- especially why it happened -- is still waiting to be told.
And there are questions about 30-year-old Alton Alexander Nolen, the man who authorities say attacked them both and might have gone after more people if not for the company's CEO, also an off-duty reserve sheriff's deputy, who confronted and shot him twice.
Lewis also said there may be other information about Nolen's past, that he could not reveal, that might help explain the incident, and that the FBI had been called in to dig deeper into Nolen's background.
Some citizens stood outside watching, putting their arms around each other and trying to make sense of the horror the day before.
It starts with a man yelling out, "Shut the doors," before calmly turning his attention to a 911 dispatcher.
Not according to Lewis, who said the suspect used a knife -- which, otherwise, would be used in the processing of produce at the plant -- to randomly inflict bloodshed.
There's no indication that the suspect, Nolen, was armed with anything other than a knife.
Mark Vaughan -- who besides being his company's CEO has been a reserve deputy with the Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office since June 2010 -- "didn't hesitate" after learning that there was a killer on the loose, Sheriff John Whetsel said in a statement.
And they've threatened more to come, especially if the United States and its allies continue to launch airstrikes at the group in Iraq and Syria.
As of Friday, all U.S. law enforcement officials said was that there are no indications linking the Moore attack to terrorism.
