Defense attorneys and prosecutors are in a pitched battle over whether a jury should be able to hear them during his ongoing murder trial in its eighth full week of testimony.
Singleton and Jenkins both face charges of their own stemming from Lloyd's killing.
In calls between Singleton and Wallace -- after he was arrested but before she was jailed on the contempt charge -- prosecutors contend she is passing on information from Wallace to Hernandez.
Hernandez's fiancée, Jenkins, has pleaded not guilty to lying before a grand jury.
Court documents state all jailhouse calls are recorded, and detainees are notified by signs and recorded messages that their phone conversations are being monitored.
I'll never go against the grain, you hear me?"
I love that ...
And I'll let her know that you know."
On August 3, 2013, Jenkins tells her fiancé Hernandez that his cousin Singleton has been jailed for refusing to testify at a grand jury in his case.
The longest she'll do is like probably less than a month ... until the grand jury is don(e), investigation, do you know what I mean?"
Jenkins: "... Why do I have to keep being the one to do that?
And I ain't even telling my own girl, nobody.
On Wednesday, Judge Susan Garsh will hear arguments and then decide whether the state can admit the jailhouse calls as evidence or if they will be barred.
