(CNN) -- Maurice Sendak, author of the classic children's book "Where the Wild Things Are," has died, a spokeswoman for HarperCollins Publishers said Tuesday.
It tells the story of a boy named Max who dresses in a white wolf costume and escapes his life at home by sailing to a remote land, where he discovers wild things who roar their terrible roars and gnash their terrible teeth.
"Where the Wild Things Are" won the Caldecott Medal in 1964, considered the most prestigious award for illustrated children's books.
His books became children's classics, but in an interview with The Atlantic last year, Sendak said he didn't set out to be known as a writer for children.
I always know that my work is deemed suitable -- more suitable -- for children.
"Children can distort, and play with figures and ideas, with a fluidity that strains us -- which we grow out of," he said.
