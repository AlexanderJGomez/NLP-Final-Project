Travelers who want more than "Basic Economy" will pay more -- Delta's not saying yet how much more -- although that's already the reality for many travelers.
Note the options on the other end of the seating spectrum: The first-class cabin will be split into "First Class" for domestic routes and "Delta One" for long-haul international and certain cross-country domestic flights.
The "Basic Economy" bare-bones coach fares will be available on domestic routes, and they're already available in some areas where Delta competes with deep discounter Spirit Airlines.
The "Delta Comfort+" coach fare on all flights will include priority boarding and dedicated overhead bin space, alcoholic drinks, premium snacks, premium entertainment, up to 4 more inches of legroom and quilted seat covers.
And who will guard that dedicated overhead bin space for "Delta Comfort+" travelers, Hobica asks.
"For some people, that might not be a big deal, but for a frequent flier who studies seat maps to choose the best seat on the plane, that's a deal-breaker for me.
That pricing structure seems Spirit-esque."
