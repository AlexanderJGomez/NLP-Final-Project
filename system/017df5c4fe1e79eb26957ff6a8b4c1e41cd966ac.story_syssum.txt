But Thom Filicia, host of the Style Network's "Dress My Nest," author of "Thom Filicia Style" and former cast member of "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy," insists that it can be done.
CNN recently asked the design guru about decorating on a budget and helpful tips to make your home look its best.
Make sure that the things you love to look at, you're seeing.
Pick a color that has life and personality.
Filicia: I like to keep things clean and straightforward.
Those things start to add layers to the room and make it a little more acoustical.
Also, I think that color definitely adds a lot of warmth to spaces.
Filicia: The first thing you want to really focus on is a great sofa, because it is really the anchor for the room.
Filicia: Yup, I have a book out right now, which is called "Thom Filicia Style," and it's a great book.
Filicia: It's very easy to use eco-friendly cleaning supplies, environmentally friendly lighting throughout your house using low wattage or eco-friendly bulbs.
