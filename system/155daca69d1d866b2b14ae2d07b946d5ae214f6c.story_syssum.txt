Los Angeles (CNN) -- Green Day canceled the rest of its North American club tour dates for this year and has postponed all January and February shows to give lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong more time to deal with substance abuse issues, the rock band said Monday.
The 21-city tour that was scheduled to start on January 7 in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and conclude on February 8 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas will be rescheduled, the group's announcement said.
"You've got to be ... kidding me," said Armstrong, noting his longevity on the music scene and disparaging teen pop sensation Justin Bieber, who was not among the festival performers.
The band later issued an apology, telling fans "that our set was not cut short by Clear Channel and to apologize to those we offended at the iHeartRadio Festival in Las Vegas."
Armstrong was rushed to a hospital in Italy in September "due to illness," Dirnt said then in a video posted on the band's website.
