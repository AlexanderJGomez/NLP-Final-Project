(CNN) -- River waters spread over highways and farms, towns and parks in Washington on Thursday, shutting down traffic on a 20-mile stretch of heavily traveled Interstate 5 between Seattle and Oregon and threatening the federal roadway north of Seattle.
North of Seattle, a levee failure in Arlington brought the Stillaguamish River up to the edges of I-5, which remained open although some access ramps were closed, transportation officials said.
The rainfall swept across virtually all of the state, but its biggest effects occurred along the western half of Puget Sound, Calkins said.
"It's a situation you don't realize you are going to be in; it's always someone else," she said from the shelter at the Sunrise Baptist Church in Puyallup, a few miles east of Tacoma.
Cutter is one of 40,000 western Washington state residents in at least 19 communities whom authorities asked to leave their homes Thursday amid heavy flooding along the region's rivers and streams.
"The larger issue is, as people go to their homes, they may be walking through floodwater that is contaminated by sewage," he said.
