WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The director of Federal Emergency Management Agency on Sunday defended giving away an estimated $85 million in hurricane relief supplies, blaming Louisiana officials for turning down the stockpiles.
Paulison told CNN's "Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer" his agency distributed more than 90,000 "living kits" to people in Louisiana whose homes were destroyed or damaged by Katrina.
After CNN reported on the giveaway, Louisiana officials asked that the supplies be redirected to the state, which originally passed on them.
"It didn't make any sense for FEMA to sit on this much stuff and supplies we normally don't even keep.
McIntyre said FEMA's storage costs were running more than $1 million a year, and that GSA officials wanted to tear down the Fort Worth, Texas, warehouses in which the stockpiles were being kept.
