Nochebuena is a Latino celebration of Christmas Eve, and it's a big night for us.
I'm flying not to Havana but to Miami, where my grandparents and other relatives came years after Fidel Castro took over Cuba, when it became clear there would be no free speech for anyone but him.
Both their home and all of their things would be confiscated by the government on the day they departed.
When we land Tuesday in Miami, my mother and uncle will meet us at the airport and rush us to Havana Harry's or some coffee stand where I can get a real Cuban coffee -- none of this Starbucks silliness.
I've never seen where she went to high school after they moved to Havana or the beaches where she swam in the summertime and where one friend dangling his foot over a pier lost it to a shark.
I will get my favorite Materva soda, too sweet for me now but still worth the memory.
My definition of beauty isn't blond hair or blue eyes or any classic American stereotype.
My mother was taught to drive by the drivers at the tobacco trucking company where my grandfather worked, and it's why she still drives a car like she means business.
But I am tired of the ads for religious charity trips to Cuba and all-inclusive beach resorts where tourists get pampered while my people, once removed, depend on charity for the most basic medical supplies.
I want to put those hints together, fill in the gaps and see for the first time, where I am from.
