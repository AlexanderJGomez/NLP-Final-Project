It was a reflex honed by the constant daily pressures of being an immigrant in a country where the language and the culture were alien.
This trend came to a sickening halt this week when the Senate sought to extend critical protections to immigrant and Native American women, as well as LGBT people.
More often than not, their abusers saw no punishment, but victims faced losing jobs, homes, marriages and custody of their children.
That led the Senate to pass an expanded version of the reauthorized bill -- one that extends protections to populations that remain vulnerable.
Undocumented women in the United States risk being held hostage by abusive spouses who lord citizenship over them as a means of control.
It seems that sanctioning an underclass of women who live in fear is a small price to pay for approval ratings at home.
In the past couple of months, Americans lent their voices to the global chorus of horror as a young Indian woman died from internal injuries after being gang raped, and we shook our collective heads self-righteously when a Pakistani girl was shot by the Taliban simply for wanting an education.
Aside from the moral repugnance of this, the actions of this minority make our great nation a hypocrite in the eyes of so many around the world who have looked to us to be beacons of democracy and equal rights.
