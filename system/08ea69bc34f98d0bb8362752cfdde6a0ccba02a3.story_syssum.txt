One of Schettino's lawyers, Salvatore Parascandola, said the defense team was "optimistic" that he would be freed from house arrest.
He is not going to escape or to repeat the crime," Parascandola said.
There isn't anything I can say, as I was convinced that passing within .28 of a mile there wouldn't be any problem."
"... We had more or less the speed needed to reach Savona on time."
"The shallows were there, but it wasn't signaled by the instruments that I had, and I went through ... in order to follow what the managers wanted."
The man behind the steering wheel, Jacob Rusli Bin, told investigators that after the ship struck the rocks, Schettino cursed and said he had not seen them, La Repubblica reported.
In the transcript, Schettino also described the chaos, saying that he helped passengers onto lifeboats and that some became stuck because of the angle of the listing ship.
However, in the wiretapped conversation, Schettino told the friend, "When I understood that the ship was tilting, I decided to leave, and left," according to Corriere della Sera.
A captain's leaving the ship with passengers still aboard is difficult to defend, said Italian criminal defense attorney Ugo Meucci, who does not represent Schettino.
