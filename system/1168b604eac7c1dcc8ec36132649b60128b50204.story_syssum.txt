A new document by Iran's supreme leader calling for the elimination of Israel shows that world powers must not rush into a deal on the country's nuclear program despite an upcoming deadline, Israel's Prime Minister said Monday.
But in the meantime, "armed resistance is the cure," he says, calling for the West Bank to be "armed like Gaza."
On Sunday, the government in the West Bank accused Hamas of bombing its leaders' homes.
It says the "proper way of eliminating Israel" is for "all the original people of Palestine including Muslims, Christians and Jews wherever they are, whether inside Palestine, in refugee camps in other countries or just anywhere else, take part in a public and organized referendum."
It's unclear who Khamenei thinks the "original people of Palestine" are, given that the region's history dates back thousands of years and includes countless waves of immigration and exile.
"There is some deconflicting, in the sense that since they have some troops or militias they control in and around Baghdad," Obama told CBS' "Face the Nation" on Sunday.
"We still have big differences with Iran's behavior vis-a-vis our allies, them poking and prodding at -- and creating unrest and sponsoring terrorism in the region, around the world, their anti-Israeli rhetoric and behavior," Obama added.
"Like all close friends, we talk honestly with one another.
"The question now is: Are we going to be able to close this final gap, so that they can re-enter the international community, sanctions can be slowly reduced, and we have verifiable, lock-tight assurances that they can't develop a nuclear weapon?
We may not be able to get there."
