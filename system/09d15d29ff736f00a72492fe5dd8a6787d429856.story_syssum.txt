(CNN) -- In his first executive order as Illinois governor, Pat Quinn established Friday the Illinois Reform Commission as an official state body under the governor's office.
The commission, led by former U.S. Attorney Patrick Collins, is an independent body that aims to evaluate existing Illinois law and practices in government, according to its Web site.
A second vote, to prevent him from holding future state office, also passed unanimously.
Federal authorities allege, among other things, that he was trying to sell or trade the Senate seat that became vacant after Barack Obama was elected president.
