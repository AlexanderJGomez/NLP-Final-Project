The discovery of 100 new plants, 28 fish, 18 reptiles, 14 amphibians, two mammals and one bird species highlights the extent of the biodiversity in the region, said Barney Long, head of the WWF's Asian Species Conservation program.
With 16 global ecoregions -- areas defined by their shared ecological features and animal communities -- the Greater Mekong has more protected spaces than anywhere else on mainland Asia, according to the WWF.
Scientists believe the high number of species unique to the island might be due to the long separation of the island from continental Vietnam, the report says.
"As we become familiar with more species in the region, our understanding of climate change and how it impacts these new species is changing," she said.
Already, Chungyalpa said, the area has been affected by an increase in tropical storms off the coast, which brings in more seawater and changes the flooding patterns in the delta.
The WWF says it supports the idea of an agreement among the Mekong countries on how to respond to infrastructure development and climate change in terms of protecting its natural resources and people.
It's such an immediate issue for us and it's going to change everything in this region if we don't address it."
