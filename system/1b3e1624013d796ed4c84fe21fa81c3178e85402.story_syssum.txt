Legislation to allow same-sex marriage in England and Wales won passage Tuesday in the House of  Commons.
The amendment, which was put forward by MP Tim Loughton, proposed extending civil partnerships to heterosexual couples as well as same-sex couples.
Minister for Women and Equalities Maria Miller, the sponsor of the same-sex marriage bill, argued that this would result in significant expense and delay, thus derailing the whole bill.
In an effort to dampen the flames, Cameron sent an e-mail late Monday to party supporters, according to UK media reports, saying he was proud of their work and would "never have around me those who sneered" at them.
The step made France the ninth country in Europe to allow same-sex marriage.
A Brazilian court this week issued a directive removing a barrier that had limited same-sex marriage, but no bill has made it through Congress.
On the other side, many states have specific laws blocking same-sex couples from legally marrying.
