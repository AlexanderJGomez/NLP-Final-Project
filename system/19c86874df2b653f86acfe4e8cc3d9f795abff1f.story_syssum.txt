One day this past March, without warning, the government took his house away, even though he and his wife, Markella, have never been charged with a crime or accused of any wrongdoing.
A month-and-a-half later police came back -- this time to seize their house, forcing the Sourvelises and their children out on the street that day.
Authorities came with the electric company in tow to turn off the power and even began locking the doors with screws, the Sourvelises say.
"It discourages crime and it takes the ill-gotten gains away from the bad people."
Unlike criminal forfeiture, the civil law allows authorities to seize property without the owner ever being convicted or even charged.
In Pennsylvania, the City of Brotherly Love is far and away the most aggressive in the state when it comes to people's property.
The Pennsylvania Attorney General's office says about $7 million went straight to the salaries for the Philadelphia District Attorney's office and the police department in just three years.
The DA's office also says it works directly with citizens, the police, government agencies, and community groups in an effort to abate or close drug properties.
The Sourvelises say they had to go to a courtroom and fight to get their home back where, instead of facing a judge, they faced a prosecutor from the DA's office.
After eight days of sleeping on a family member's couch, the Sourvelises were let back into their house, but only on the guarantee they would ban their son from the house -- a heartbreaking decision, they say.
The Philadelphia District Attorney's office told CNN it strictly follows the state law in an effort to crack down on drug abuse.
