McCain responded by tossing out the name of a dear old friend and colleague, the very man who would be nominated to that post by a Democrat and frequent McCain target 13 years later.
But when the Senate Armed Services Committee meets on Thursday to discuss the nomination, McCain will be one of Hagel's biggest skeptics.
"His life has been committed to something larger than he is," Hagel said after McCain suspended his campaign effort to make way for an ascendent George W. Bush.
Back in the Senate, the long-time friends and combat veterans both voiced early concerns about the handling of the Iraq war.
The two traveled together on a Middle East Senate trip Obama used to beef up his foreign policy chops, and Hagel was never seen on McCain's iconic Straight Talk Express campaign bus.
But citing their long friendship, McCain said he would not oppose Hagel before the hearing.
