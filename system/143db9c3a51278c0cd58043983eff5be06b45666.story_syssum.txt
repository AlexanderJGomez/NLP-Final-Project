(CNN) -- The man Chilean authorities accuse of sparking a wildfire that has consumed more than 31,000 acres of a national park said Sunday that he is innocent.
Zinger is accused of lighting a fire in a prohibited area of the protected Torres del Paine National Park in southern Chile, regional prosecutor Juan Agustin Melendez said.
Authorities will be looking into what caused the wildfire for months, Melendez said.
Hundreds of firefighters are battling the blaze, but authorities have said they don't know when the fire will be under control.
