(CNN)Jeb Bush will make his first scheduled appearance this year to the critically important state of Iowa next month for the Iowa Agriculture Summit in Des Moines on March 7.
The former Florida governor makes his first major public address Wednesday since announcing in December he was actively exploring a presidential bid, though he hasn't officially announced a campaign.
He was a frequent punching bag for some of the speakers — Donald Trump said to big applause: "The last thing we need is another Bush" — and the former governor's push for Common Core education standards was an even bigger target that day.
The Hawkeye State is already seeing a range of potential candidates making stops in the state.
