But officials in Aberdeen, Maryland, say they are still looking for motives in the case and haven't found evidence of ransom demands for Violet Ripken, the mother of one of baseball's most celebrated players.
"At this time I can say we know of no ransom demand," Aberdeen Police Chief Henry Trabert told reporters.
The official was not aware of any attempt to ask anyone for a ransom, but said the suspect did take Mrs. Ripken's credit cards and it appears he has used them at several places.
"This has been a very trying time for our family, but we are grateful and relieved that mom is back with us, safe and healthy," the statement said.
He holds the Major League Baseball record for playing in the most consecutive games -- 2,632 from 1982 to 1998.
