He said earlier in a statement that he was sorry for the trouble he has caused, said New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly.
Police found human remains in Aron's freezer and a trash bin which they believe are those of the boy, who went missing Monday afternoon.
Kelly said detectives found the remains in a freezer in Aron's third-floor attic apartment and in a trash bin more than two miles away, wrapped in a black plastic garbage bag inside a suitcase.
Surveillance video showed Aron entering a dentist's office Monday while Kletzky waited for him across the street for seven minutes, Kelly said.
Inside the refrigerator was a cutting board with three blood-spattered carving knives, Kelly said.
"We're all in shock," said state Assemblyman Dov Hikind of the people in his district.
After Kletzky went missing Monday, residents joined with local and federal authorities in a massive search effort.
