NASA's Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite is scheduled to drop its Centaur upper-stage rocket on the lunar surface at 7:31 a.m.
Four minutes later, the LCROSS will follow through the debris plume, collecting and relaying data back to Earth before crashing into the Cabeus crater near the moon's south pole.
"We expect the debris plumes to be visible through midsized backyard telescopes -- 10 inches and larger," said Brian Day at NASA's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, California.
Ames will host "Impact Night," an event with music and food starting Thursday evening before a live transmission of the lunar impact will be shown around 4:30 a.m. PT Friday.
The impacts will not be visible to the naked eye or through binoculars.
The two main components of the LCROSS mission are the shepherding spacecraft and the Centaur upper stage rocket.
NASA has said it believes water on the moon could be a valuable resource in the agency's quest to explore the solar system.
The observatory is in Fremont Peak State Park, which is on a list of California parks that could close because of recent budget cuts.
Samuels said he hopes Friday's event triggers more interest in astronomy, particularly among young children, and possibly help the park to stay open.
He said he's arranged for a school bus to pick up the kids early Friday and take the class to the Powell Observatory in Louisburg, Kansas.
"We're not in Florida, we're not in Texas, we're not in Silicon Valley -- it's not something they're used to seeing.
