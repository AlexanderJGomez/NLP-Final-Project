A 34-year-old man being sought in a woman's death has been arrested in connection with the killings of two homeless men who were shot three days apart while both were sleeping on sidewalks, Atlanta police said Friday.
"We are actively working with multiple agencies at this time and cannot provide any further information that may jeopardize ongoing investigations," Ross said.
A lot of our shootings involve someone making good on an old debt or some kind of revenge factor," Atlanta police Detective David Quinn told reporters earlier this week.
Less than three days later, Tommy Mims, 64, didn't show up as normal at a recycling center where he took cans and other scrap metals to sell.
The rounds used in both shootings are fairly distinctive: .45-caliber bullets that, according to Quinn, haven't been made since 2010.
"These guns have a capacity of five or six rounds," Quinn said.
