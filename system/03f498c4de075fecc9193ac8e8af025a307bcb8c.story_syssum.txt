Dr. Seuss' widow, Audrey Geisel, accepted his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2004.
It's often questioned whether that was Seuss' intent in the first place, but when he was still alive, he threatened to sue an anti-abortion group unless they removed his words from their letterhead.
Karl ZoBell, the attorney for Dr. Seuss' interests and for his widow, Audrey Geisel, says that she doesn't like people to "hijack Dr. Seuss characters or material to front their own points of view."
Bennett Cerf, Dr. Seuss' editor, bet him that he couldn't write a book using 50 words or less.
Not one to back down from a challenge, Mr. Geisel started writing and came up with "Green Eggs and Ham" -- which uses exactly 50 words.
In 1974, he sent a copy of Marvin K. Mooney to his friend Art Buchwald at the Washington Post.
In it, he crossed out "Marvin K. Mooney" and replaced it with "Richard M. Nixon," which Buchwald reprinted in its entirety.
Eventually, Yertle notices the moon and is furious that anything dare be higher than himself, and is about ready to call for more turtles when Mack burps.
Dr. Seuss actually said Yertle was a representation of Hitler.
"The Butter Battle Book" is one I had never heard of, perhaps with good reason: it was pulled from the shelves of libraries for a while because of the reference to the Cold War and the arms race.
The book concludes with each side ready to drop their ultimate bombs on each other, but the reader doesn't know how it actually turns out.
If you're wondering why they sound a bit different, it's because the sound people went back to the Grinch's parts and removed all of the high tones in Karloff's voice.
He received no credit on screen, so Dr. Seuss wrote to columnists in every major U.S. newspaper to tell them exactly who had sung the song.
