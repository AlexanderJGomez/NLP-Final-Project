Zari is the first woman to run for Pakistan's parliament from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, the restive region that has become a hotbed of the Taliban.
When election day comes in May, Zari hopes to win one of the 60 seats set aside for women in the 342-seat National Assembly.
That's a dangerous position in a region where the Taliban shot and grievously wounded a 15-year-old girl who pushed for sending girls to school.
"I am now 38 years old, and I do not want any other little girls to be kept from going to school just because society doesn't think it is right or proper."
"I have promised her that I will do whatever she wants me to do in support of her."
