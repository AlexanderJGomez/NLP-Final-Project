(CNN)Searchers have found the tail section of AirAsia Flight QZ8501 in the murky depths of the Java Sea, raising hopes that the plane's black boxes and the precious information they hold might soon be recovered.
That's assuming the flight recorders didn't come loose as the plane went down and hit the water.
The data recorder provides a wide range of valuable information about what the plane was doing, from its air speed to the position of the landing gear.
Soelistyo said Wednesday that divers were preparing to go back underwater in the same area, which is in one of the priority zones where search efforts have been focused.
Searchers have been scouring the choppy waters of the Java Sea for remains from the commercial jet since it lost contact, with 162 people on board.
Search teams had located several large pieces of wreckage believed to be from the plane but none of them as significant as the tail.
The vast majority of the people on the plane were Indonesian.
