(CNN) -- Fourteen months after she was left paralyzed by a pool mishap at her bachelorette party, Rachelle Friedman is having the wedding of her dreams Friday -- and then some.
"I can't compare our relationship to anyone else," she said.
Afterward, the group went to her best friend's home, where they started playing around near the pool.
Friedman, who suffered a spinal cord injury and paralysis from the chest down, has remained close to the friend through the trauma each suffered.
They were concerned that she may not qualify for Medicaid if she married, but they since learned she was ineligible.
"It blew me away, how upbeat and positive she is," said Donne Kerestic, CEO of 1-800-Registry, based in Nevada.
Friedman, who likes country music, is excited about having a band and deejay at the reception, planned at a large barn.
The recreation management major plays wheelchair "quad rugby" for the Raleigh Sidewinders and has spoken at several venues, including an adaptive sports and wellness day, where people with disabilities were exposed to sports like kayaking, basketball and rugby.
The accident introduced them to new friends and brought their families closer together.
Excited about being able to lie on the beach in Fiji, Friedman also anticipates three weeks of treatment at Project Walk, a facility in Carlsbad, California, that helps people with spinal cord injuries.
The nonprofit center's aim is helping patients improve their function below their injury level, build strength and find hope, said Eric Harness, head of research and development.
"It's so awesome that they give to live as husband and wife, like everyone should, with or without a disability," Carol Friedman said.
