Los Angeles (CNN) -- Conrad Murray, who literally sang his innocence in a jail cell interview with CNN in April, has given his first interviews since spending two years in jail for the death of Michael Jackson.
The cardiologist said he found Jackson to be "in crisis at the end of his life, filled with panic and misery" as he prepared for his comeback concerts in 2009.
Because I did nothing wrong, and all I tried to do was to help a friend who I encountered in a devastated state.
In the streets, he envied all the lucky boys, but goodness knows, he didn't want a lot.
As I grew up, my heart has been whole and my heart says to help, and all I do is to give.
A jury concluded after a two-month trial in 2011 that Murray's negligence led to Jackson's death from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol.
His appeal of the conviction is still pending in a California court.
