Just two days after the accident, he was found dead after apparently hanging himself using a belt from a tree in the city of Jindo.
There were no pallbearers carrying the coffin -- only a quick walking procession of his family members and what appeared to be about a hundred others dressed in black following the car through the parking lot.
The whole walk took less than five minutes before the mourners got in and drove in a line of cars headed to the crematorium.
Over 300 students from the school and their teachers were aboard the ferry.
He said he could not live not knowing where his students are.
People who wish to say farewell visit a funeral room and pay their respects to the deceased one's family.
Another student, Kim Hyun Soo, also a freshman, said she felt it was too harsh for Kang to be blamed for what happened on the ferry.
Messages of sympathy and grief have been outpouring on social media.
"We are so sorry..." tweeted Kim Min Hyuk, a senior at the high school, who tweeted the name of the vice principal along with the names of other dead teachers from the ferry tragedy.
The hearse carrying his coffin traveled a few miles east and pulled into Danwon High School, circling the campus for one last time -- signifying Kang's last visit to his school.
