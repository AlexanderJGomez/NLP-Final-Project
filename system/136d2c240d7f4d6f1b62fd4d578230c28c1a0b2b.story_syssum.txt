Over the course of the day, there were more than 71.7 million election related posts and comments on Facebook in the United States and 88.7 million around the world.
Obama was mentioned 10 million times on Facebook during Election Day.
In just one hour, from 11 p.m. to 12 a.m., he was mentioned 4.1 million times on Facebook -- more than Romney's 4 million total for the entire day.
Unpolitic.me will not only block the offending posts, it will replace them with the ultimate bipartisian animal, cats.
