London (CNN) -- European leaders recently thrashed out a deal aimed at ending months of uncertainty over the future of the euro and resolving an escalating debt crisis that has pushed several economies to the brink of collapse.
• The legal framework will see those signed up to the deal effectively hand more sovereign powers over to centralized European control.
• Voting rules in the European Stability Mechanism will be changed to allow emergency decisions to be passed with an 85% qualified majority -- an attempt to move away from the deadlock that has stymied earlier bailouts.
The ESM will get €700 billion in funds paid in by eurozone countries relative to the size of their economies.
It will likely come from the banks' reserve funds, although the details are not yet agreed.
Some European Union nations have balked at ceding further powers to EU authorities and have threatened to walk away.
All 17 eurozone nations and six other EU states outside the euro area have signed up.
Ireland has decided to hold a referendum on the fiscal pact because under the Irish constitution the people have to vote to ratify any significant transfer of sovereignty to Europe.
With Britain forcing the treaty to operate outside EU mechanisms, there could be an appetite among the rest of Europe to cold shoulder the UK and concentrate resources within their new club.
Ideally, everyone will stick to the new rules, and those countries that require emergency bailouts will be granted them, allowing the European Union to slowly put its debt problems behind it.
This could lead to an evaporation of investor confidence, the collapse of debt-exposed banks, an emptying of government coffers, a nosedive by share markets, and bleak prospects for the euro.
