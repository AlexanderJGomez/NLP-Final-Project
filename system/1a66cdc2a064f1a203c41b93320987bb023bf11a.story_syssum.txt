The world's second-largest supplier of network gear by revenue has shifted the focus of expansion away from the US over the past year.
Despite its success in other markets, including the UK, Huawei has struggled in the US for years because of concerns among politicians and security officials about the military background of its founder Ren Zhengfei, a former People's Liberation Army officer.
It hired a number of senior executives from ailing rivals such as Nortel and Motorola, in an effort to build a big research and development presence.
But October's congressional report made it even more difficult for the company to do business in the US, Huawei executives say.
William Xu, the unit's chief executive, said its goal of generating $15bn in revenues from the business by 2017 -- a target set just last year -- was "too optimistic".
