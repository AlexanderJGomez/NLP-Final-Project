"Puss in Boots" cost $130 million to produce, and it earned Dreamworks' third-worst debut for a computer animated film, beating only "Flushed Away" and "Antz," which started with $18.8 million and $17.2 million, respectively.
The 3-D "Shrek"-spinoff, cost as much as Dreamworks' "Megamind," which opened in early November 2010, but that film began with $46 million, and it played well through the Thanksgiving season on its way to a $148.4 million total.
That debut is less than Timberlake's last film, "Friends with Benefits," which began with $18.6 million on its way to $55.8 million, as well as Seyfried's recent "Red Riding Hood," which debuted with $14 million on its way to $37.6 million.
The $24 million production has now earned $38.5 million after 17 days in theaters, and it will pass the total of Julianne Hough's first feature film, "Burlesque" ($39.4 million), sometime this week.
The disappointing opening fell in line with Depp's other substance abuse picture, 1998â€²s "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas," which debuted to $3.3 million and earned $10.7 million total.
Talk about a bad hangover...
