Two decades after he first entered the season's third major event, the 42-year-old made history as he triumphed by three shots from Americans Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson in its 140th staging at Royal St. George's in England.
Clarke became the third player from Northern Ireland to win a major title in the past 13 months, following Rory McIlroy's U.S. Open triumph last month and Graeme McDowell's success at the same tournament last year.
Clarke has twice won World Golf Championship events, in 2003 and 2003, while he has finished second on the European Tour's money list three times.
It was his worst score in four rounds at the links course, which has been buffeted by the weather this week, as he took home the $1.45 million first prize to the cheers of the crowd in Sandwich.
First-round leader Thomas Bjorn, whose father died in May, finished fourth on 279 after the 40-year-old Dane closed with 71.
England's Tom Lewis was the top amateur, with the 20-year-old tied for 30th as he fell away after sharing the early lead with Bjorn following his opening 65.
