No premiere date has been announced, but NBC has said Leno's exit and Fallon's debut will coincide with the Winter Olympics coverage in 2014.
Meyers, 39, would be the fourth comedian to host "Late Night" since it went on the air in 1982, starting with David Letterman and followed by Conan O'Brien and Fallon.
"I only have to work for Lorne for five more years before I pay him back for the time I totaled his car," Meyers said in the NBC news release.
"12:30 on NBC has long been incredible real estate.Â  I hope I can do it justice."
