The One is a top-notch, beautifully designed handset packed with the best specs and a ton of compelling features.
Although the phone carries the branding established last year with the One X, One S, and other HTC phones, the One amounts to a reboot of the company's vision for Android.
The result is a slick, clean user interface, full of artful icons that match the flat, understated look Google has been trying to push with its own stock version of Android.
And there's a focus in the new Sense on making things that users commonly do easier and more intuitive — such as sifting through social media and news apps, or snapping photos and video.
While it's easy to see the chamfered edges found on the One and think of the iPhone 5, the One is far from a copycat product.
While the One won't replace your Jambox anytime soon, its onboard speakers sound immensely better than anything we've heard from a phone.
The One will also sports a beefed up camera, with a ton of photo and video features — which are so plentiful we've written a separate story focusing on the One's camera.
Just tap the tile in your feed and you're taken to a view that shows the story and its accompanying artwork in a presentation that makes reading clean and easy — again, very much like Flipboard, Pocket, Pulse and other "read it later" services.
If you want to get to a traditional Android homescreen view — with apps, widgets and folders of apps — just swipe in from the right on BlinkFeed and Android as you know it will appear.
So [BlinkFeed] really is geared around that recognition of how people are actually using their phones."
All too often, a great phone, like last year's One X, was confined to a limited audience due to carriers wanting exclusive rights to phones.
