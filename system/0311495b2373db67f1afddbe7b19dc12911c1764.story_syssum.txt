Despite larger postseason umpiring crews that include two extra umps in the outfield, it feels like an inordinate number of calls have gone the wrong way.
A National Football League ref can make anywhere from $25,000 to $70,000 a season, although since most of the games are on Sundays, they can also have other jobs during the week.
Officials in other sports pull down more loot, but they have much more grueling schedules...
Each ump gets a $340 per diem to cover hotel and food, and when they fly, it's always first class.
They also get four weeks of paid vacation during the regular season.
There are some nice fringe benefits, too; when referee Tim Donaghy admitted to helping gamblers fix games, the NBA asked that he repay other benefits he'd pulled in over the course of his 13-year career, including $750 worth of sneakers and $4500 worth of free tickets.
• Walt Coleman is infamous in Oakland for being the ref in the "Tuck Rule Game," but he's also a fifth-generation dairy farmer who once held the position of president of the Arkansas Dairy Products Association.
Prior to becoming a referee, he was better known as Dr. Walt Anderson, a dentist.
• Bill Leavy is similarly tough; he spent 27 years as a police officer and firefighter in San Jose.
He's a trial lawyer in the Arizona firm Jones, Skelton, and Hochuli, which employs over 80 attorneys.
Hochuli started as a Pop Warner ref in the early 1970s; he was a law school student who needed a little extra pocket cash.
In a recent op-ed in The New York Times, former baseball commissioner Fay Vincent cited the paltry salaries for minor-league umps: just $9500 for a five-month season for junior umpires, and only $20,000 a season for guys who have risen all the way to Triple A ball.
