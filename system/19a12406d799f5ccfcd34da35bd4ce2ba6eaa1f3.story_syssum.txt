Carrey spoke with CNN's Larry King about his life on and off the screen.
... [But] you know, "Meet the Parents" was something that I was developing.
Carrey: It's a gentleman by the name of Carl Allen, who has kind of stopped living.
...  And he makes a covenant with this man that he will say yes to everything no matter how ridiculous it is.
It's like, you know, there's so many people, man.
I feel so lucky to be given all of these opportunities, to be able to do a movie like "Ace Ventura" and then do "The Truman Show" and "Eternal Sunshine," and to be able to do the "Yes Man," which is flat-out comedy and that has a little something to think about.
Carrey: It's funny how that happens when you're in a place that's really wonderful.
It was one of those times when you don't have to be anywhere but where you are.
And I just stood there in the middle of the room and kind of had that feeling like I was everything I felt.
She was brilliant, but that wasn't the choice I would make.
You're just lucky while it's there, you know.
I love Jenny very much, and we have a great relationship.
I really don't, at this point of my life, feel like I need to have the approval of someone in the collar or a judge to tell us that our relationship is sacred.
You never get to see what the problem is, because everything is just kind of OK. And so, you don't deal.
It's a wonderful thing.
Carrey: Yes.
