These are the words of retired U.S. Army Commander Lt. General Russel L. Honore at a recent speaking event on leadership in the 21st century.
My wife, who is a fifth-grade school teacher in Fulton County, Georgia, received word that her school was shutting down because of the inclement weather.
And I soon discovered that skills honed over years in the newsroom, were my best tools for assisting my wife and children.
Midnight approached and my wife told me she hadn't been able to move the car at all since 10 p.m.
I called Georgia State Patrol and explained to them that my wife and kids were stranded in a vehicle among hundreds of other vehicles.
I stayed in touch with my wife a minimum of once per hour and at times twice per hour.
My wife later told me she cried only once, around 5 a.m., not knowing when she was going to be able to get the children home.
She imagined having to wait for days, maybe until the snow and ice melted.
"I didn't let the girls see me cry," she said.
I thought about Gen. Honore, who I have come to admire even more since hearing him talk about leadership and life lessons.
She said she didn't think I could get to her.
Taking me in his four-wheel -drive truck, Rucker expertly traversed the thick ice on bridges passing hundreds of stranded vehicles along the way.
I moved my wife's car into the median and left it there not knowing or caring when the traffic would start to move.
I was leading my family home.
