I had a slight fear this day would come, because only a couple of days earlier, I had a strange call from a friend asking me what I would do if we were visited by the police or some type of investigation team.
We were shown how it worked and some of us had a chance to do some math testing.
For the first time in my life, I saw something that made me imagine what I wanted to do when I grew up.
For the next couple of years I built a friendship with a group of people who had interests similar to mine -- some closer than others.
We ended up getting into about a dozen computer systems -- from the Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York to a major international bank system in Los Angeles to the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, one of only two U.S. laboratories dedicated to nuclear weapons research.
We would share information with each other about any particularly interesting system we connected to and, when we got together for Explorers, we'd talk about exploring, not harming systems.
After about a year of back and forth with the FBI, three of us were eventually charged under a federal provision against harassing phone calls, which carried a maximum of six months in prison and a $500 fine each.
The judge agreed to a plea deal with a stipulation that I could not own a modem during the time I remained on probation.
Today, more than 30 years later, I'm still fascinated by computers: I'm employed as a network engineer and, at home, I tinker around on about half a dozen computers.
We could have caused some damage to these companies and many were surprised that we just looked around and played games.
