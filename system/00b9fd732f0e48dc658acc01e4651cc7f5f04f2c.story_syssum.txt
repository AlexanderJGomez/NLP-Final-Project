(CNN) -- Jeff Yeager says the economic downturn is an opportunity for people to simplify their lives and be content with less.
And that's really what I write about is, maybe there's a silver lining to this economic downturn.
Maybe we can simplify our lives, be content with less and actually enjoy life more.
I do wonder, though, as you've gone through this process, if you will, if you become the ultimate cheapskate, are you noticing now a lot more people kind of joining your club?
You know, in this economy, we hear a lot of stories about how to get more stuff for 20 percent less.
All right, so let's get to these five things, because that's what everybody really wants to hear about.
Yeager: If these things apply to your family.
First thing you say, give up your cell phone.
I've got to push back for a second, because a lot of people will tell you you can be happier with a cell phone because you're out of the office and you're with your family more, still able to still do business.
There's an interesting article in the recent Christian Science Monitor that shows the actual cost of using a cell phone could be more than $3 a minute by time you factor in unused minutes and so on.
The Auto Club says it costs about, on average, $1 a mile to drive a car by the time you factor in the cost of the car, depreciation and so on.
You can cut that by 80 percent by cooking those same meals at home and you know, maybe recapture some family time around the dinner table.
Yeager: We're too busy to cook because we're too busy earning the money to spend it by dining out.
Certainly most of us have more than enough stuff in our closet that we could go six months, even a year without buying new clothes.
Yeager: And again, less than 2 percent of the clothes we throw away are worn out.
Back in my days, lots of people, including myself, lived at home when we went to college.
Therefore, we didn't take out any college student loans.
