In China there is little understanding of American society, or its politics.
As for the candidates, people know Obama as a personality, but few could tell you what his government has accomplished in the last four years -- and Mitt Romney remains a complete unknown.
By not tackling these controversial topics, the candidates are protecting a strategic partnership with China at the expense of essential human values and beliefs.
The campaigns are mere showcases, extravagant yet empty -- and the time, money and energy spent on the grand spectacle could have been used to solve specific problems for Americans.
I don't think people like the way the debates and elections are designed, but at least they're an outlet for people to make a stand.
There is no consensus on recognized elders, no clear set of values, no independent state military, no full citizenship, no international respect, no transparency for leaders' whereabouts, no clear borders, no equal access to defense attorneys, no proper administration of justice, no taxpayer rights... As a country, China is missing all the qualities it needs to call itself a country.
But while China desires to understand the world, it fails to accept its universal values.
That sort of censorship wouldn't happen in the U.S. -- but even though America's government allows its critics to speak out, it is difficult to create any real impact in a country where a vast number of voices are at risk of being drowned out by others.
But as the world's two great superpowers, the upcoming U.S. election and Chinese leadership reshuffle demonstrate two different extremes in handling shifts in political power.
