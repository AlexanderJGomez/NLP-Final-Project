Yet despite our struggles, my family never lost hope that life would get better for us.
Now before you dismiss the notion that a chain restaurant could somehow be a beacon of light, you have to understand that in my neighborhood, if your family went to Red Lobster for dinner, that meant you were really doing something.
"Our industry is in a period of significant change,with relatively low levels of consumer demand in each of the past several years for restaurants generally, and for casual dining in particular," said Clarence Otis, the CEO of Darden, the parent company of Red Lobster, Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse, among others.
But for black households like the one I grew up in, income fell by nearly 11%, more than twice the rate of Latino homes and three times that of whites.
But it's a mistake to blame the erosion of buying power and the decline of middle-class touchstones like Red Lobster or JCPenney on just the Great Recession.
That small uptick may not seem like much until you factor in three years ago, wages increased 1.8%, and the CPI was up 3.5%.
Luxuries like going out to eat, which has slowed considerably since 2010.
I'm no economist, but I doubt that the struggles of the working class and the struggles of a restaurant that depends on the working class for business are just a coincidence.
