Regardless of how much you shower, Naya Rivera is the gift that keeps giving to celebrity watchers like ourselves.
"I feel like showering more than once a day or every day is such a white people thing."
Rivera apologized for any offense she caused the next day on "The View."
Rivera became something of a sexy lesbian icon for her generation when Santana, her character on Glee, finally came out about her relationship with fellow student Brittany (played by Heather Morris).
Even though she's newly married (to a man), we're happy she understands the compliment.
It's all female best friends for Rivera and all male best friends for her new husband, Rivera told members of the "The View" in November.
"I feel like you're playing with fire and opening up the floodgates here, and you're having issues in your marriage, but someone is going to talk to the opposite sex to get advice or whatever and you should be talking to your partner," she said.
