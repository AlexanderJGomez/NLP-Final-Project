The agency is not doing a formal investigation, TSA spokesman Sterling Payne told CNN, but it is gathering information to determine if one is needed.
Roll Call had a report in its gossip column earlier this week, based on an unnamed eyewitness, that Vitter arrived at the airport 20 minutes before his United Airlines flight was scheduled to depart.
"I did have a conversation with an airline employee, but it was certainly not like this silly gossip column made it out to be."
CNN's Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.
