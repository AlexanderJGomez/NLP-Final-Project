(CNN) -- CNN and the Cartoon Network's presentation of the AC360Â° special feature, "The Bully Effect," spotlight a serious issue affecting children across our nation.

Faced with the possibility of such far reaching consequences, it is more important than ever that we put a stop to the intimidation of our youth.
I applaud those who are already working to make schools a place where all children can achieve their full potential without fear of being bullied, and I urge my colleagues in Congress to work with me in passing the Safe Schools Improvement Act.
