"I urge you, in a country where there's still a lot of rage, never respond by rage, respond through reason and you will have gotten not just a degree, but an education," says Jansen, looking into the eyes of his students.
"The way out of poverty is through learning and those basic values I have carried with me throughout my leadership," says Jansen, who is not only an academic but has a wider audience as author, newspaper columnist and the president of the South African Institute of Race Relations.
"It's odd for me because it's like we don't get it that in a modern interconnected economy you better be up there playing with the best," he says.
A firm believer of the society's responsibility to insist on a qualitative education system, Jansen,  a Fulbright scholar, assumed his current role at the University of the Free State in 2009 after the institution faced controversy over racism and racial integration.
Jansen was roundly criticized for that gesture, which only served to contribute to his reputation for being outspoken.
