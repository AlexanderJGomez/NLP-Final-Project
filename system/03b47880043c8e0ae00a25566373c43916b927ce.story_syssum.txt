Sure, there was the possibility of syndication, but there weren't cable channels that ran "Law & Order" marathons.
Consider how the world has changed since 1988, the last time the Writers Guild went on strike.
Now Bruce, and the rest of us, are staring at 500 channels and countless media permutations.
"Once another medium, particularly cable, gets a chance to draw viewers away, they don't come back, and that wasn't the case in 1988," TV historian Tim Brooks told the trade publication Multichannel News.
"Traditional media needs the exposure on the talk shows, but what they really need is to go where the audience is migrating to, and that is the Internet," Jerry Del Colliano, a University of Southern California music-industry professor, told The Associated Press.)
Robert Thompson, the Syracuse University pop culture expert, doubts things will come to that: "When you think about the shows we loved best ... they were told by brilliant writers," he told Multichannel News.
But the earlier strike -- which began March 7 of that year, lasted 22 weeks, postponed the beginning of the 1988-89 TV season and cost an estimated $500 million -- gave rise to a group of low-budgeted shows, including "America's Most Wanted," "Cops" and "America's Favorite Home Videos," which became the forerunners of the reality show trend.
They're generally inexpensive to produce -- and, as many writers noticed during the reality craze earlier this decade, they don't need writers.
