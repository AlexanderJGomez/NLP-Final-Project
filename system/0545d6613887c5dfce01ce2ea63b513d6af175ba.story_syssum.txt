It's not like Jon Stewart intentionally wanted us to become more Muslim.
There he encountered a woman opposed to the mosque who told him that, "one in five Muslims were terrorists."
When Aasif asked how it could be more so, one person responded with, "What if they had a terrorist uncle who lived in the basement with a goat?"
