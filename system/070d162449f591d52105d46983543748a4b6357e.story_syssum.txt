Nude photographs of Pakistani actress Veena Malik, published in the December issue of the Indian edition of the men's magazine FHM prompted Malik to threaten a lawsuit.
In a legal notice served to the magazine, Malik contends that it was Sharma's idea for her to wear the painted on ISI tattoo; she was told t would be good for her image.
Bilawala didn't dispute the ISI print on Malik's left upper arm but said numerous organizations worldwide used the same acronym.
Malik said she never agreed to pose nude, the prospect of which sparked outrage in her homeland.
"If I had posed nude for the magazine, I would be the first to admit it.
She triggered uproar two years ago when she claimed that her former boyfriend, Pakistani cricketer Mohammed Asif, was involved in spot-fixing international matches.
