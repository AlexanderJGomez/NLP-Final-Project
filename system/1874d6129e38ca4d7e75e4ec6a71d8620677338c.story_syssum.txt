In Miami, basketball star Dwyane Wade tied the knot with actress Gabrielle Union on Saturday, the same weekend that Ashlee Simpson -- the musical younger sister of Jessica Simpson -- reportedly wed Diana Ross' actor son Evan in Connecticut, and Donnie Wahlberg said "I do" to Jenny McCarthy.
She later posted a photo of the newly bound Wade-Union family, which includes Wade's nephew and his two sons from his prior marriage.
Not to be outdone, Miami Heat star Wade, 32, was heavily involved in the wedding planning, including securing his look for the evening.
According to People magazine, the ceremony was attended by close friends and family, including Simpson's sister, Jessica, and Simpson's 5-year-old son Bronx Mowgli, whose father is her ex-husband Pete Wentz.
It was on the ABC talk show that McCarthy, 41, announced her engagement to Wahlberg, 45, in April.
