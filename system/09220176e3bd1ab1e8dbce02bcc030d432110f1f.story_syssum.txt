If "French chic" has become synonymous with the elegance, grace and style of its country's powerhouse fashion labels and catwalk shows, this weekend that glamor will be out in force on a very different type of track -- the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.
Such was the clampdown on decorum at this year's Royal Ascot, organizers went to the extent of publishing style guides for race-goers.
Set on the picturesque Longchamp racecourse in Paris, "the Arc," as it is known, prides itself on being Europe's most prestigious -- and richest -- horse race.
Each year the grandstands fill with the "crème de la crème" of European society, with Monaco's Princess Charlotte Casiraghi, the daughter of Princess Caroline, and Spanish model Irene Salvador some of the glamorous guests in 2011.
Yet despite this emphasis on prestige, the Arc also remains one of Europe's most accessible races for the average punter, with general admission to Sunday's headline event costing just €8 ($10.4).
But its chances now look unlikely after drawing the far outside stall 18, where just one horse has won in the 92-year history of the race.
Whatever the outcome, one thing is for sure, the French crowd will be celebrating in style.
