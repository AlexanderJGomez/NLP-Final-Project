Galligan, the former Army lawyer who has been the lead attorney for Hasan since nearly the beginning of the case, was not present at Hasan's arraignment Wednesday at Fort Hood.
Galligan had fought the Department of Defense for months to make sure his client gets a fair trial.
"I have consistently argued that Major Hasan has not been treated fairly.
However, Major Hasan fully understands that I stand ready and anxious to resume an active role."
When a person faces a possible death penalty under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the law prohibits a guilty plea.
Witnesses at a preliminary hearing have identified Hasan as the man who walked calmly through a medical building on the country's largest military base, shooting and frequently reloading his handgun as he shouted "Allah Akbar," which means "God is great" in Arabic.
Hasan was shot by Fort Hood police officers and has been paralyzed from the center of his chest down since the attack.
He took it off during the hearing and put it back on just before wheeling himself out of the courtroom.
