A 100- to 150-foot section of levee gave way outside West Alton, Missouri, Tuesday near the point where the Missouri River joins the Mississippi, St. Charles County's emergency management office reported.
The area is home to a nearly 1,000-megawatt coal-burning power plant, and officials were hauling truckloads of stone and heavy earth-moving equipment to the site in an attempt to prevent the levee from failing.
On Monday emergency teams rushed to get hundreds of people to safety, after a levee breach on the Missouri River near West Alton.
The Mississippi had been running so low that the Corps feared it would have to close the waterway to barge traffic.
