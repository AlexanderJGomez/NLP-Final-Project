(CNN) -- While he's enormously concerned about what secrets self-avowed NSA leaker Edward Snowden may yet spill, President Barack Obama said Thursday he's not going to take extraordinary measures to capture him.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said Tuesday his country would consider a formal request for political asylum from Snowden -- which it hadn't then received -- and Foreign Minister Elias Jaua reiterated that position Thursday.
Snowden has sought asylum there, the same country that has already agreed to shelter WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, albeit at its embassy in London.
The programs in question aren't free-trade agreements but U.S. laws that don't require Ecuadorian consent, so Alvarado's declaration may have little more than a symbolic effect.
The head of the Ecuadorian Business Committee said he's worried that "very important" commerce between the two nations could be negatively impacted as a result of this tiff.
While he has applied to Ecuador for asylum, that request has not yet been "dealt with" because Snowden is not in the country, Ecuadorian Political Affairs Secretary Betty Tola told reporters.
Alexander pointed to 54 related cases that Congress was informed about, of which 50 led to arrests or detentions.
"These leaks have inflamed and sensationalized, for ignoble purposes, the work that (the) intelligence community does lawfully, over strict oversight and compliance."
Commenting on New York Times reporting based on leaks related to confidential surveillance programs involving Iran, the poster compared the newspaper to WikiLeaks -- which enraged U.S. officials by disclosing thousands of confidential diplomatic cables.
Ars Techica said it could not be certain the poster was Snowden, but information revealed in the posts matches biographical information he has since publicly revealed.
