Paviglianiti says she feared how her boss would react to her pregnancy and wanted to wait a few months to tell him.
Due to the tough economy, Paviglianiti says she needed this specific bartending job and feared she'd soon be out of work.
"Maybe they don't go there because the bartender is pregnant and doesn't look sexy."
In this case, that means Paviglianiti would have had to be hired as a "model and a bartender" and get a written agreement to this -- as is done in the casino industry, Bond said on HLN Prime News with Mike Galanos.
"Ms. Paviglianiti was not terminated from her employment, she presently is on maternity leave and she has the right to return to work upon the conclusion of her leave."
