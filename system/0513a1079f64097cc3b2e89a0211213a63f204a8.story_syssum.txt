(CNN)  -- "LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean" holds fast to the pirate code with great humor and animation, appeal for all ages and massive replayability after the main story mode is complete.
Players can use up to eight different characters on each level during story mode, but that can lead to a crowded screen.
Ellison said the settings are as iconic as they could be and the team tried to put the LEGO spin on the movies.
The game play is all about exploring the vast scenes in each level.
Since the scenes are so big, it would be easy to get lost or frustrated without those helpers.
The humor from the movies really shines in LEGO form, which uses its blocky medium to put interesting spins on the tale.
"We will have some of the same locations but none of the dialogue (LEGO characters do not speak, only grunt).
As in other LEGO video games, two people in the same room can drop in and out as separate characters and solve all the puzzles.
My co-op player and I found it confusing and, at times, frustrating to figure out where we needed to go or what we needed to do unless we were on the same screen.
Finding all the collectibles and solving all the brain teasers will keep play going for many hours after the story mode is complete.
The game is also available for the Nintendo 3DS, but there are only 16 levels, and you can use only one character during each level.
Overall, the game is lots of fun despite some playability glitches.
This review was done playing on the Xbox 360 in story mode, co-op mode and free play.
