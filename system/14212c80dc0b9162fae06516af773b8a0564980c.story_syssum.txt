Asked whether he fears that a victory by the PRI in next year's presidential elections may bring back a corrupt relationship with organized crime, Calderon, a member of the PAN, conceded that is one of his fears.
"I don't consider it an appropriate statement for a head of state," said the former Tlaxcala governor.
The controversy, which started Sunday with the publication of the president's comments, prompted Mexican Interior Minister Jose Francisco Blake Mora to make a public appearance Monday to clarify the issue in front of the Mexican media.
In a way, they (government officials) would tell them (organized crime): 'You cross through here and you through there; but don't touch these places," Rizzo said.
Blake Mora pointed out that there are numerous Mexican public officials in prison, convicted of serving the interests of organized crime.
"That's why we're working on a new dynamic, a new platform which will strengthen the institutions of our country," he said.
