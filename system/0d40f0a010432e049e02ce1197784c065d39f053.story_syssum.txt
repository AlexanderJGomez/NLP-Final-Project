After a shooting, reporters rush to find people who can talk about the accused.
Such has not been the case so far with Evan Ebel, 28, the man suspected of killing Colorado prison chief Tom Clements last week.
"From the beginning, his son just seemed to have this bad streak, a streak of cruelty, and anger," Colorado Gov.
"I could see him, he'd be running out on the front lawn to come out to a car with his friends and he would have screaming, obscenity-laced arguments with them sometimes," she said.
As a teenager, Ebel was sent to a boot-camp-type program in Samoa, where according to one person who knew him there, almost everyone avoided him.
Police have also said there is a "strong connection" between the killings of Clements and that of Nathan Collin Leon, a pizza delivery driver who was found dead in suburban Golden, Colorado.
Mangue writes about her children on a blog she originally started in memory of her 16-year-old daughter, who died in a car accident in 2004.
Mangue and Ebel's father kept in close contact, sending letters, cards and visiting their son when they could.
Once, after a sleepover at a friend's house, he brought home a small gray kitten named Sparkles.
"As determined the media is in trying to pick apart our son, Evan for a good story, they will never succeed, he is out of their reach.
That time was hard for Ebel, Frey said, and it may have made things worse.
He never liked being told what to do and his time in isolation really only compacted that," Frey said.
