After laying low, Ryan swept into the budget battle crippling Washington with a plan to break the stalemate that has resulted in a government shutdown and no agreement so far on avoiding a possible U.S. debt default.
That enabled House Republicans to propose an approach on Friday on the fiscal impasse that still hasn't met President Barack Obama's chief requirements, but hasn't scotched negotiations, either.
He might be the person in the Republican Party to do it.
Ryan and Obama, on the other hand, have a completely different relationship.
While they spent months criticizing and deriding each other on the campaign trail, the mantra of politics is not personal seems to be true with these two.
What's more, a White House official told CNN that the President viewed Ryan's op-ed as an opening and provided an opportunity for negotiations to open the government and lift the ceiling to take place.
CNN's Gloria Borger put it this way: Ryan and President Obama have a "preexisting condition."
It was the first time Obama and Ryan had sat down together since the presidential race.
Ryan introduced himself as "a ranking member of the Budget Committee," indicating he wasn't sure the president knew who he was.
While they have been on different sides of nearly every debate, their relationship is not broken.
