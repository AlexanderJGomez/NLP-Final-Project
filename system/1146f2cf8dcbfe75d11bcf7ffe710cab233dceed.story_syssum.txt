Since leaving the State Department in 2013, Hillary Clinton has headlined six events in Canada and organizers in the country announced two more appearances in two different provinces on Monday.
With the addition of these appearances, Clinton has now headlined events in six of Canada's ten provinces (the country also has three territories).
"I do believe that both Canada and the United States can become even richer, more prosperous, but also more environmentally sustainable by having a broad engagement over energy and climate and not focusing everything on this one decision," Clinton said.
Obviously, if Clinton runs for president in 2016, she will not be able to take money from Canadians or win a non-existent Canadian primary.
