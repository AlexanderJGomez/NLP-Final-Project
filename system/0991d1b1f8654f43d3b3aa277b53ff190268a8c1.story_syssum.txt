Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Members of Latin America's largest guerrilla group declared Thursday they will ask for an immediate cease fire when they meet with Colombian government negotiators for peace talks next month.
"We no longer have any captives," Jaramillo said before asserting that kidnappings by criminal and paramilitary organizations are often blamed on the FARC.
Jaramillo said a cease fire would be proposed as soon as negotiators meet next month, but the FARC is prepared to continue fighting.
As part of a road map for a possible peace deal, the FARC has said the government will need to enact land reform for peasant farmers, help coca growers plant other crops and reintegrate thousands of FARC soldiers into Colombian society.
FARC negotiators refused to say at the news conference whether Trinidad's inclusion is symbolic or if his release is an initial demand to the Colombian government.
