(CNN) -- The family of the man authorities say was dismembered by a Canadian porn actor called for the suspect's quick extradition Tuesday and expressed hope that their "devastating situation" could become something positive.
The family traveled from a village in China last week to reclaim their son's remains -- parts of which had been mailed to the headquarters of Canada's Conservative and Liberal parties and to two schools in Vancouver, on the Pacific coast.
"We are calling for the extradition of the murder suspect back to Canada as soon as possible in order to bring justice and peace to our family, the Chinese community and the whole society," they said.
German authorities nabbed him June 4 in Berlin, where they said he had been spotted browsing online articles about himself at an Internet cafe.
