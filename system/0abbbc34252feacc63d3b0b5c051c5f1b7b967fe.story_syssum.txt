A couple from Georgia was traveling to a Craigslist transaction last month when they left their suburban Atlanta home in hopes of buying a 1966 Ford Mustang.
In a separate incident Friday, two men in Georgia met a seller to purchase a dog.
Remember this is a business transaction, so never reveal Social Security numbers, home or business addresses or banking information.
Use an anonymous email address to communicate with the buyer or seller.
Most cell phone and landline carriers offer this by dialing *67 before making the outgoing call.
Use a cashier's check instead and make it a non-negotiable term of the transaction.
Conduct these transactions at a banking facility so a banking professional can confirm the funds have been delivered successfully.
Find a neutral site to meet -- never at your or someone else's home.
Most police departments will be happy to accommodate you, and they are open 24/7.
