A video installation, called "A Letter Can Always Reach Its Destination," featuring people reading from scam emails, is one of the five winning pieces of the Abraaj Capital Art Prize unveiled at Art Dubai this week.
The winners were announced last October, and the artists had five months to work on their pieces.
"You can read a kind of history of the world over the last 10 years in a different way through these emails.
A more personal piece comes from the Palestinian artist Taysir Batniji, who produced "To My Brother, which he describes as a tribute to his brother Mayssara, killed by an Israeli sniper during the First Intifada in 1987.
Lebanese artist Raed Yassin combines his take on his country's civil war with the ancient tradition of recording military victories on vases.
The two remaining prize winners also give a modern twist to historical events or art forms.
The scene shown is taken from a painting by the French painter Jean Fouquet featuring Pope Urban II delivering a speech, which is thought to have led to the launch of the First Crusade one year later, in 1096.
"The works all refer to history and how we are living in a moment when the models we are used to are coming apart, from the Arab Spring, to financial crisis in Europe and America to the Occupy Movements," she said.
"Now in Dubai there's an art scene that's maturing so these political and critical artworks can be appreciated in a place like this," added Muller.
