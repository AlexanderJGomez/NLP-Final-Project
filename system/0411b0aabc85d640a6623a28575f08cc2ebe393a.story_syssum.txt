Stuck in a foot of snow on a road somewhere outside Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, the couple from Wisconsin pulled all the clothes out of their suitcases and wore them, trying to keep warm in their car with temperatures dipping below zero.
Their route took them on Beartooth Highway, but they said they didn't see any signs warning that the road was closed.
Meanwhile, Troy Barnett, who owns the K Bar Z Guest Ranch near Cody, Wyoming, heard about the missing couple when his wife spotted it on Facebook Sunday night.
Monday morning, Barnett got out the snowmobile he hadn't used since last fall, made sure it was in running order, loaded it into his pickup truck and set out to look for the Wathkes.
Inside the car, the couple heard something.
"I asked if everyone was okay and if they need medical attention and if they were warm enough."
Barnett said it's not the first time he's helped someone in that area.
"It's really rural up here, we're just up in the mountains."
