Hong Kong (CNN) -- Nestled within Hong Kong's dense skyscraper jungle, a $640,000 property sits among some of the world's most expensive commercial and residential spaces.
Described in local media as "the tycoon of parking spaces," he is effusive when talking about this particular "priceless" gem.
"You can go straight to the office and the elevator.
According to the latest Parking Rate Survey by Colliers International, the global property services firm, this city has the most exorbitant monthly parking fees in the Asia-Pacific.
The reason for Hong Kong's pricey parking rates is rooted in governmental curbs on the city's residential market, said Buggle Lau, chief analyst at Midland Realty, one of the city's largest real estate companies.
The regulations have produced desired results, said Lau, leading to a 31% fall in home sale transactions over the past 23 months.
"If you look at this year's (total sales) number, it's the highest in the past ten years or so," Lau said.
The second thing is commercial, which is about 2% to 2.5%, and then residential which is about 3%.
If Hong Kong's economy stalls the first thing people will get rid of will be their cars.
