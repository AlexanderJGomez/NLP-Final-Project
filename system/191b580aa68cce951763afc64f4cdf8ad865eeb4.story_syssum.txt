Washington (CNN) -- After weeks of military analysts examining the latest North Korean rocket before and after its failed launch, the focus now has turned to a truck.
The U.N. Security Council committee that monitors implementation of the sanctions on North Korea is investigating, the official said.
Or China may have sold the truck to North Korea in the years before the sanctions were in place.
Few experts are willing to say what was seen in the parade was real, "I think you create parade missiles for public display that don't have all the external equipment that's on them versus the real flight vehicles."
Lt. Gen. Patrick O'Reilly told a congressional committee earlier this week, "Our experience has been you need a lot of testing and flight testing in order to validate and have reliance in the capability.
And their progress has not been made apparent in this latest flight test."
