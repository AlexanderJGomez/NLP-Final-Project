(CNN) -- It has been five years since Mohammad Z. left Syria to train as a doctor in Detroit.
"I can't tell you how many wonderful Syrians I have met here who've devoted their money and time to see a democratic, free Syria," said Mohammed, whose last name is being withheld by CNN to protect his brother and parents in Syria.
"These are people who've been exposed to the American culture and brought up in an environment -- even in Syria -- where there was Internet and dishes and satellites and they can see how the rest of the world lives," said Naser Danan, a Cleveland-based doctor with the Syrian Expatriates Organization.
While the expat group has members in other Arab countries and in Europe, Danan estimated that a majority of the 600 or so members are young doctors in the United States -- ironic, because al-Assad himself has a medical degree.
A few expatriates in the United States are part of the Syrian National Council, the group that many Syrians consider to be the official political opposition.
In Detroit, Mohammad said he was going to anti-al-Assad rallies even before the Syrian secret police, the Mukhabarhat, arrested his brother who was protesting in Syria.
But as soon as he was freed, he returned to protesting.
"It's an epic, a human epic that's being written by the Syrian people."
