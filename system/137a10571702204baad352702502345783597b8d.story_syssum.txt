For much of the past decade, Iran's nuclear weapons development program has been one of the top national security concerns for the United States.
For this reason, I have pressed for ever-tightening sanctions to isolate Iran from the global economy and have supported a policy that leaves all options on the table, including military force.
In the meantime, there have been calls for the Senate to continue work on a new round of sanctions that was passed by the House with my support earlier this year.
President Barack Obama and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry have asked for more time to test Iran's willingness to enter into a tough and verifiable process of ending its nuclear weapons program, and I think we should give it to them.
The Iranians must be made to understand that if they walk away or cheat, the sanctions will be tightened to the point of strangulation -- and the international community must be prepared to make good on that threat.
Even if Rouhani was serious about his intentions, there is no guarantee that Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, would bless any agreement with the international community that forces Iran to verifiably foreswear development of the bomb.
But neither should the administration be prevented from testing whether it can obtain a good deal that advances our security interests and those of our allies.
