The American veterinarian from Oregon spent the day in a prison in the small Southeast Asian nation of East Timor.
Addison shares a cell with two other women and has received treatment for an abscess at the prison clinic, her mother said.
At that point, the police surrounded the car and arrested all three of them."
"The person who picked up the package, he told the police and he testified before the judge that he didn't know my daughter," Kero said.
But the terms of Addison's release prevented her from leaving East Timor while the investigation into the case continued.
"We consider this to be a violation of human rights," Remedios said, but he warned that under East Timor's criminal procedure law, an individual can be held in detention for up to a year while there is an ongoing investigation.
The U.S. government is seeking "a fair and expeditious resolution to this case in accordance with Timorese law," the State Department official said.
The staff of Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon have been "working with the State Department and her family to get this resolved as quickly as possible," said Hank Stern, a spokesman for the senator.
Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley's office is also working with the family, he said.
