Monae insists that her real identity is Cindi Mayweather, an android traveling through space and time to escape destruction ordered because she fell in love with a human, a fatal infraction of robots' rules.
"I believe she's going to be a household name in the next year or two," said Trinidad, a self-described "champion of the underdog" who is credited with giving Jill Scott and Gnarls Barkley early radio airplay.
Monae delivered a sweet version of Nat King Cole's "Smile" while standing atop a barstool.
She jumped head-first into the audience, "crowd surfing" the unlikely mosh pit in UCLA's Royce Hall.
"She was just kind of like bored with everything else going on, and she wanted to transcend it and tell a story," he said.
Monae will inevitably capture the world's attention because she is "outshining a lot of what's happening in the mainstream," Trinidad said.
Her tour stops next month include at least six shows in the northeastern United States, opening for Gwen Stefani's reunited rock group No Doubt.
