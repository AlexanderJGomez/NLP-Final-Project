Andrew McCormick, 56, has been charged with involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, statutory sexual assault, sexual assault, endangering the welfare of a child, corrupting the morals of a minor, indecent assault and indecent exposure in connection with the alleged 1997 incident, Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams announced Tuesday.
After the incident happened, the defendant tried to ensure that the victim would not tell anyone about the abuse by telling the boy, "Masturbation is a sin, homosexuality is a sin, premarital sex is a sin and lying is a sin," Williams said.
In December of 2011 the man reported the alleged incident to the police department's Special Victims Unit after seeing news coverage of the sexual abuse scandals at Penn State and the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, said Police Capt.
A 2011 grand jury report led the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office to criminally charge four Philadelphia priests and a parochial school teacher with raping and assaulting boys in their care, while Monsignor William Lynn was accused of allowing the abusive priests to have access to children.
As a result of the administrative leave, McCormick has not been permitted to exercise his public ministry, administer any of the sacraments, or present himself publicly as a priest, according to the Archdiocese of Philadelphia.
McCormick is scheduled for a preliminary hearing on August 17.
