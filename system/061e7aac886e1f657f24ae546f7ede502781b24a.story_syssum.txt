Think of Zite, the free personalized iPad magazine that launched today, as the Genius playlist or Pandora of news discovery -- but with one noticeable advantage: Zite is smarter, at least for now.
Link a Twitter account or Google Reader, and Zite will analyze (not simply display) your feeds to create a magazine tailored to your interests.
Did I enjoy straight-news items or editorials?
"It's a combination of semantic- and statistically based machine learning," says CEO Ali Davar, of Zite's content algorithm, the technology of which has been in development for years.
Users can tell Zite whether they enjoyed a particular article, whether they liked a particular source, or whether they want more news on a particular topic area.
Users can select these topics on their own, but Zite is best at autosuggesting them--after playing with the app for a week, Zite began featuring "Graphic Design & Typography" as one of my top news sections.
According to the Vancouver-based company, Zite is the first iPad news reader "to go beyond manual customization."
So, for example, your technology section and someone else's will look very different based on your behavior -- rather than being the same generic thing that everyone else is seeing."
But when it comes to "personalized" content discovery, Zite follows in the same impressive footsteps as Pandora and Netflix -- and certainly gives Flipboard a run for its money.
