(CNN) -- While Spain wallows in the doldrums of economic despondency and political turmoil, with youth unemployment at eye-watering levels and Catalan separatists threatening to tear away at the country's seams, there is one place where its stock has never been higher.
As the youngest champion in the history of top-level motorcycling, known by his Catalan fans as "the Thunder from Cervera," he has a vividly bright future.
"I remember one of his last races in the old 125 class, in Portugal," he said.
The Spaniard's smiling demeanor has not only won him fans off the track, it also appears to have helped guide him through the stresses of the MotoGP season.
Although the other guys are walking to and from their motorhome and the box, in between the two they have their sunglasses and their headphones on and are not talking to anybody.
"Mother nature didn't gift Lorenzo the way she gifted Marquez," Poncharal said.
"The most important thing is to be a very good rider," he said.
"To join one of the best teams, with what looks like the best bike this year -- and with Lorenzo and Pedrosa both injuring themselves and missing a race early in the year -- for him to then get the confidence of actually learning how to win, and getting a couple of wins under his belt, all those factors put into the pot have just made him so confident in what he's doing," he said.
This enables him to better gauge what both the front and the rear of the bike are doing, providing a "fourth wheel" to help him get around faster.
"I used to get my elbow down with qualifying tires, and that's what it's all about really -- it's the tire technology, Bridgestone have obviously developed a tire with the edge grip now that enables the bike to lean over that far, and also enable you to lean off the bike that much with the confidence that the grip is there," he said.
