Beijing (CNN) -- Dozens of Chinese workers angry over a pay dispute have held their U.S. boss hostage for five days, the American businessman said.
The incident started when the company laid off about 30 workers in its injection molding division.
But workers who spoke to CNN from behind the factory gates gave an entirely different account.
U.S. embassy officials in Beijing met with Starnes on Monday and confirmed he is safe and is close to reaching an agreement, spokesman Nolan Barkhouse said.
Starnes said the employees haven't caused any physical harm but have disrupted his sleep by banging on doors and windows.
