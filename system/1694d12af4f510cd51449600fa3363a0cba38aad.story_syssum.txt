But folks in Mingo County are about to get a whole lot closer to Crum, who was appointed sheriff Thursday by the county's commissioners.
"She's always seemed like a strong person too."
"They have been a pillar in the community and done everything that they felt was the right thing to do, and we feel this is the right thing for us to do," Baisden said about Crum's appointment.
"We have the full support of the sheriff's department, right down to every man that we spoke to as a deputy, and their support for this is overwhelming.
Baisden said he met with Crum earlier in the day, and that she was understandably emotional.
Photographs of the new sheriff on her Facebook page show a woman with an easy smile.
It's small town U.S.A., and it will help us overcome the void that's in our hearts," he said.
