"Women here were empowered a long time ago, but haven't had a chance to tell our story," said Ghubash.
In searching for a home for the museum, Ghubash turned down a free site in Dubai's official heritage district for an old house in the historic Gold Souk neighborhood she grew up in.
The museum contains a room dedicated to the Emirati woman poet Ousha Bint Khalifa -- known as the Girl of Arabia, a gallery devoted to temporary art exhibitions, a collection of Arabian fragrances and oils, traditional jewelery and a women's study center.
Ghubash, 56, has undertaken the museum project while taking a sabbatical from a career that led to her being listed 36th on Arabian Business magazine's "100 Most Powerful Arab Women" in 2011.
She also founded the Arab Network of Women in Science and Technology, and served as its president for four years.
Having achieved her goal in opening the museum, Ghubash is not content to rest and revel in the glory.
