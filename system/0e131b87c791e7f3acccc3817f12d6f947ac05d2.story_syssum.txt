Flier's client was facing up to a year in jail and the attorney was prepared to offer closing arguments in the case on Wednesday.
Prosecutors do not identify those who makes claims of domestic violence, and the parties involved have made no public statement, Mateljan said.
But after interviewing Hanks in jury selection, Flier decided he was a good fit for the final slot on the jury.
If the case hadn't ended in a plea, Flier said he doesn't know how Hanks would have voted.
So he never disclosed what that justice was headed for, the defense or the prosecution."
