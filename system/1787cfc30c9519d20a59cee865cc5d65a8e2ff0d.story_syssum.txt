The likes of Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) and Domino's pizza are opening up in African growth markets from Nigeria to Angola to give consumers a taste of U.S. cuisine.
And with growing political and economic stability, Western fast food brands are approaching the region with a renewed sense of optimism, according to Schulze.
With two stores already, Domino's is planning to launch three more African branches by the end of this year.
However, the cost of Western fast food brands in many parts of Africa relative to wages remains high, excluding many people, who simply cannot afford it.
On average, the region is set to grow at more than 5% between 2013-15 as millions of new consumers emerge from poverty and commodity prices continue to rise, according to data from the World Bank.
