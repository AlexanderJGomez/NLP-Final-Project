It produced something resembling a plan for ISIS, and some palliatives for the next possible crisis in Eastern Europe by beefing up security in Poland and the Baltic States.
Ukrainian President Poroshenko's speech to Congress in September was interrupted by applause 40 times, but his barbed remark that Ukraine "cannot win a war with blankets" only produced $53 million in non-lethal aid.
And Russia's entire modus operandi, of which its current actions in Ukraine are only the most visible part, is not only a challenge to the European order, but a challenge that is dangerously exploiting the many existing problems within the EU.
So, here is a list of reasons to be concerned.
Ukrainian voters in the October elections showed a strong desire to get back to the original story.
Russia has been creating an alternative media space in the Baltic States for years.
The Russian economy was already flat-lining even before the oil price started heading south.
None of the scenarios look good: if Putin rides out the pain and the Russian economy really crashes; if the pain leads to internal crisis in Russia; or if EU soft-liners water down sanctions before they have their full effect.
Russia is actually keen on Serbia joining the EU, in order to have another client state on the inside.
If sanctions stay at the current level, Russia will really feel the pain in six months.
