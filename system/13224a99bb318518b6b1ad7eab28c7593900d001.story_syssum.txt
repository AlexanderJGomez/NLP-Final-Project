Greece called for the immediate arrest of the ship's captain, but organizers on the ship insisted they no longer had a captain.
The Greek Coast Guard issued a statement saying, "The Tahrir tried to leave the port of Agios Nikolaos in Crete without permission.
It is not clear if this will be extended to other passengers on board.
The Tahrir is one of 10 ships trying to head to Gaza despite Israel's maritime blockade.
Last week, the Greek Coast Guard intercepted a U.S. ship in the flotilla, the Audacity of Hope, about 10 minutes after it left Perama, triggering an hours-long standoff.
But Chief Palestinian Negotiator Saeb Erakat said Sunday that funneling food, cement and other goods via other means, such as Greek ships, missed the point, which he said is to "immediately lift, not ease" Israel's maritime blockade of Gaza.
The territory is run by Hamas, which has carried out dozens of terrorist attacks and is listed by the United States as a terrorist organization.
The Quartet added that it "strongly urges all those wishing to deliver goods to the people of Gaza to do so through established channels, so that their cargo can be inspected and transferred via established land crossings."
"We invite them to focus on resolving the root cause of the conflict, which is the occupation, rather than seeking ways to manage its destructive symptoms."
