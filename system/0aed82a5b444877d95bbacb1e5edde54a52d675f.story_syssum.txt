(CNN) -- Besides charting the nature of space and time and penning the bestseller "A Brief History of Time," Stephen Hawking has another distinction: He beat the life-expectancy odds for people with ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
The British physicist also embodies the idea of empowering people with ALS to live life to the fullest, said Dr. Lucie Bruijn, scientific director for the ALS Association, in an e-mail.
The disease causes the death of motor neurons, meaning the brain loses its ability to control muscle movement.
He has participated in some of the organization's high-profile events, said Mel Barry, communications manager at the MND Association.
Barry said she knows of a man in Ireland who has lived with the disease for 30 years -- but only about 5 percent of people with ALS live longer than 10 years.
"It slowly takes over your entire muscle structure and eventually your limbs are affected, your speech may or may not be affected.
Loss of voice is another potential symptom, but some people are able to speak until they die, Barry said.
Drugs in these trials include lithium, ceftriaxone, and memantine, according to the ALS Association.
An FDA-approved drug called riluzole has been shown to prolong survival for some ALS patients, but extends the life span by only three to six months, Barry said.
Stem cell therapy may hold promise for the disease, but the general perception is that research into it is not sufficiently advanced, according to the MND Association.
