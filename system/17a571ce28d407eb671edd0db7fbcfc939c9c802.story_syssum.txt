(CNN) -- On Sunday, the live Web broadcast of perhaps the world's most prestigious science fiction awards ended up in the Twilight Zone.
Ustream says automated software designed to detect the unauthorized posting of copyrighted material was triggered when, before Gaiman's speech, the ceremony showed clips of "The Doctor's Wife," an episode of the popular sci-fi series "Doctor Who," that Gaiman penned.
The Hugo Awards had permission to air the clips but apparently had not notified Ustream.
Perhaps as a boon to disappointed fans, Gaiman, a prolific Twitter user with more than 1.7 million followers, shared a link Monday to his video acceptance speech from when he won the SFX Award for screenwriting in February.
