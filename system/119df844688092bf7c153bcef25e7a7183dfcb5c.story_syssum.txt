The unrest comes after a string of self-immolations by Tibetan protesters in recent months and with the approach of the anniversary of an uprising against Chinese rule, which has been a flash point in the past.
"We are seriously concerned by reports of violence continuing, heightened tensions in the Tibetan area of China, including reports that security forces in Sichuan Province have been opening fire on protesters, killing some and injuring others," Victoria Nuland, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, said Tuesday.
Citing witnesses, rights groups like Free Tibet and the International Campaign for Tibet say that thousands of Tibetans had marched on government offices before the police opened fire into the unarmed crowd, killing two or three protesters and injuring dozens.
There was no immediate reaction from the Chinese authorities on the reports of violence in Seda.
"Silence from the world community sends a clear message to China that its repressive and violent measures to handle tensions in Tibetan areas are acceptable."
