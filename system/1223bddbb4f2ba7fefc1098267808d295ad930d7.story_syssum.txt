Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan, whose career has been derailed by drunken driving convictions, probation violations and a shoplifting charge, admitted in an interview with talk show host Jay Leno to "poor decisions in the past" -- but predicted an Oscar is in her future.
Lohan, 24, said she's been cast to play mobster John "Junior" Gotti's wife in a movie, but a 120-day jail sentence and several months of community service for a probation violation threatens to keep her out of the movie.
Lohan said she was "kind of numb" when Sautner sentenced her to 120 days in jail and 480 hours of community service.
"Being young and being in a position that I was in, you don't really take the time to appreciate what you have, and it's all kind of a whirlwind and people make decisions for you," she said.
"Hopefully, sitting here after winning an Oscar," Lohan said.
