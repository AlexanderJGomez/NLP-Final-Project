Their faces offer a stark contrast: She looks away, concerned and distraught while he stares at the camera with an inquisitive gaze, trying to make sense of it all.
Founder Sara Khazem has learned that these young photographers' own lives are not that different from the children they photograph.
While growing up in Beirut, she would see street children cleaning the windshield of her parents' car and would wonder, "Why am I so different from them?"
For many of these children, this is their first time even holding a camera.
Khazem decided to conduct her first workshop in Egypt where, according to a report from the International Organization for Migration in Cairo, there are an estimated 2 million children living on the streets.
Worldwide, exact statistics are difficult to come by, but the United Nations has estimated the number of street children in the tens of millions -- perhaps around 100 million.
At the conclusion of the workshop, a gallery of the children's work is set up to display their once-hidden talents.
They return to their shelters and caregivers with their shiny new cameras in hand to continue learning about their craft.
Last March Khazem conducted her sixth workshop -- this time in Marrakesh, Morocco -- working with another nongovernmental organization like her own that helps underprivileged children.
"They have also gained self-confidence as the gallery provides a space for them to be acknowledged by the audience for their artistic talent."
