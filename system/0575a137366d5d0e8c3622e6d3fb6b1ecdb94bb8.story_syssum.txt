(CNN) -- To control costs and increase flexibility, more and more U.S. mobile users are choosing no-contract plans (month-to-month or prepaid) for cell phone service.
AT&T Gophone received the overall worst customer satisfaction rating this year, with poor to middling marks in all categories.
Powers reports that this year, about half of of all no-contract customers have month-to-month plans, rather than prepaid ones.
Powers: "Monthly non-contract customers spend an average of $32 less per month than do customers with contracts.
For example, MetroPCS currently offers a no-contract Huawei Ascend touchscreen phone running Android 2.1 for $129 after a $50 instant discount and $30 mail-in rebate; the month-to-month plan cost is $50.
Right now, the major U.S. wireless carriers are making considerable revenue off of smartphone customers under two-year contracts.
