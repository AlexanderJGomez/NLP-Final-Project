"It is an accusation that does not seem very true, because my son was never involved in any terrorist acts," father Juan Jose Pimentel, 51, told CNN en Espa√±ol Tuesday.
Juan Jose Pimentel said his son converted to Islam five years ago, but never appeared to be an extremist.
He allegedly told police he was an hour away from completing his first bomb when he was arrested, according to the complaint.
Jose Pimentel, also known as Muhammad Yusuf, according to the criminal complaint, had a "very active and very public online profile," prosecutors said.
Jose Pimentel's attorney, Joseph Zablocki, said Monday that the case against his client is nowhere near as strong as authorities say.
