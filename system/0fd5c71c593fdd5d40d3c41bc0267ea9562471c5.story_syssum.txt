In his second debate with Mitt Romney, the president delivered a comeback performance that will stand as a model for future debaters of how to right a listing ship.
Obama's arguments were not always as succinctly stated as they needed to be, and he too often strayed far from the topic at hand.
At times Romney seemed taken aback by this fresh incarnation of the debater he had bested two weeks ago.
The thing that really gets Romney exercised in these debates is when he thinks he's not getting his due, which means he wastes far too much time demanding another minute or the final say or a chance to go back to something from a previous answer.
This became apparent every time Romney began a response with "I appreciate that" or "that's an important question," words that signaled his discomfort with many of the topics the voters wanted to discuss, like equal pay for women, banning assault weapons or immigration.
After the president brought up his rival's overseas investments, Romney cited Obama's own holdings: "Have you looked at your pension?"
The governor's response might have been written by the staff of "Saturday Night Live:" "President Bush and I are different people and these are different times," he said.
