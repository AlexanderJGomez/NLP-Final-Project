Now this contortionist is headed to another arena with bright lights, where all eyes are focused on him: the operating room.
He's been clean for more than five years, but the thought of anything affecting his sobriety -- particularly opioid painkillers after surgery -- is something he isn't willing to risk.
He's determined to not let it become his reality, both for his own benefit, and to show other addicts they don't have to fear a day where they need surgery.
"We don't have exact numbers of the percentage of former addicts that are going back for surgery, but this is definitely a growing problem in America," said Dr. Boris Spektor, assistant professor of anesthesiology and pain management at Emory University and the person who will be managing Joe's pain throughout the process.
