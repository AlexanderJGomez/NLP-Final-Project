It landed in my inbox at 1:58 a.m. on Thursday.
Anthem, which is the second largest health insurer in the United States, said on Thursday that as many as 80 million customer records were stolen.
Unless you're connected to them personally, though, they tend to zip by, too numerous and massive to process.
I found that view echoed by Paul Henry, a senior instructor at the SANS Institute, an information security training company.
Henry told me he gets really annoyed when companies like Anthem claim that they were the victims of a "very sophisticated" hack.
Henry told me the U.S. Federal Trade Commission could find that Anthem failed to institute industry "best practices" -- as defined by the industry, he said -- and force them to pay a fine.
I called someone with that point of view and Avivah Litan, a cyber security analyst at Gartner, said she doesn't think it's fair to blame Anthem for the stolen data.
I'm the one who got the email ...) If your credit card data is stolen, she said, there are easy ways to rectify the situation.
"The government should really have some sort of agency where you just call up and you say, 'I had this bad thing happen' -- and they'll just fix it for you.
"To me, and I'm a security expert, that's worth more than a credit card.
They could take all that information and fake a birth certificate and go to the DMV ..."
Both security experts did share one answer: the Social Security number itself.
And Litan explained to me that there may be a way for health care companies, and other industries, to use a hard-to-crack proxy for a Social Security number in place of the real thing.
We're helpless in this situation -- unable to understand exactly how and where our data is being stored.
Whether that's holding companies more accountable, as Henry suggests.
And then we hung up.
