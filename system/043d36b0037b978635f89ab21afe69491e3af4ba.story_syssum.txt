At least five people died on Tuesday, according to a resident who requested anonymity for safety reasons, and the city remained under siege amid a military offensive against protesters.
Snipers perched atop various locations in the city's al-Ramel neighborhood, the site of a Palestinian refugee camp, he said.
The resident said a large portion of the Ramel area has been evacuated.
"We are asking the Syrian government for immediate access to the Palestinians, as their well-being is our responsibility," Gunness told CNN.
It also reported Tuesday that reports of shelling by the navy on Ramel are "completely untrue."
The vast majority were civilians, and 391 were security personnel, the LCC said.
