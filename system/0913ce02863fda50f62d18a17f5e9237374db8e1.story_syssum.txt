(CNN) -- The space shuttle Atlantis crew completed its first spacewalk to upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope, a daylong act of grueling labor that featured the replacement and installation of key instruments.
And it's turning easily now," Feustel said.
The team "installed a soft capture mechanism, a device that will allow future vehicles to attach to the telescope," NASA said.
It was the first of five spacewalks scheduled during the 11-day mission in which the crew will work in the shuttle's cargo bay to upgrade and repair Hubble.
Atlantis launched Monday afternoon for NASA's fifth and final repair visit to the telescope.
After a two-day chase, the shuttle captured the telescope Wednesday with its robotic arm some 350 miles above Earth and pulled it into Atlantis' cargo bay for service.
NASA canceled an Atlantis mission to extend Hubble's operational life in January 2004 because the trip was considered too risky in the wake of the 2003 space shuttle Columbia disaster, which killed seven astronauts.
But public pressure and steps taken to increase shuttle safety led the space agency to reconsider.
