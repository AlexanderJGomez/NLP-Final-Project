The larger of the country's two main islands is more visually stunning than the North Island.
Named New Zealand Travel Photographer of the Year in 2013 by the New Zealand Institute of Professional Photography, Hollman grew up on the South Island and says the landscape has had a tremendous impact on his work.
With an annual rainfall of 6.8 meters, Milford Sound is one of the wettest places in New Zealand.
He recommends the view from Bennets Bluff Lookout, 25 kilometers from Queenstown.
There's a lot to explore in the area.
St. Clair Beach is one of the beautiful sandy beaches that sweep along the eastern suburbs of Dunedin.
These large, strange-looking spherical concretions eroded from the shoreline are some of nature's oddest sights.
The boulders are located on Koekohe Beach on State Highway One, 75 kilometers north of Dunedin or 40 kilometers south of Oamaru.
Tekapo is located on State Highway 8, midway between Christchurch and Queenstown.
Found along the shores of Lake Tekapo and surrounding countryside, the flowers are usually at their best during the first two weeks of December.
The village is 334 kilometers from Christchurch, and 258 kilometers from Queenstown.
Located in Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park, Tasman Glacier on Tasman Lake is New Zealand's longest glacier at 27 kilometers.
Formed by glaciation 14,000 years ago, it's surrounded by an ancient native forest.
A main attraction on the South Island's west coast, this 12-kilometer-long glacier descends from high peaks through temperate rainforest to just about 300 meters above sea level.
"There are many options and they operate out of all of the local tourist areas.
"The braided river banks and mountain light make for some great landscape photography," says Hollman.
His work has been featured in National Geographic's travel photo competitions, published in books and magazines and can be viewed at http://www.mikehollman.com and www.facebook.com/mikehollman.photograph.
