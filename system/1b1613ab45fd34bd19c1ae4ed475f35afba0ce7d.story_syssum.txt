(CNN) -- Wisconsin's Republican attorney general on Monday appealed a judge's decision to halt the enactment of a controversial new law that curbs the collective bargaining rights of most state employees.
"The (Wisconsin) Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a court may not void any act of the Legislature for alleged failure to follow a non-constitutional rule of legislative process," Van Hollen's brief states.
GOP lawmakers countered that the law will help the state close a massive budget shortfall with a plan that requires public workers, with the exception of police and firefighters, to cover more of their retirement plan contributions and health care premiums.
Over the objections of a Democratic House member, the lawmakers carved the governor's proposed curbs on collective bargaining out of Walker's budget legislation and passed them in a separate bill.
Jim Doyle, also a Democrat, filed suit.
