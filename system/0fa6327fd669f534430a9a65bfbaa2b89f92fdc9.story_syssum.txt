(CNN) -- Thousands of angry demonstrators gathered in Paris Saturday to demand answers over the deaths of three Kurdish women activists found shot dead Thursday in mysterious circumstances.
Kurdish activists have pointed the finger at possible Turkish involvement, while political leaders in Turkey have nodded to a possible feud within the PKK.
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called on the French authorities Saturday to find the killers, the semiofficial Anatolian news agency reported.
Erdogan had previously suggested the deaths "could be an internal settling of scores, or it could be an initiative that was taken to create an obstacle in the way of the new honest steps we are taking," according to the Anatolian news agency.
Several hundred mostly Kurdish demonstrators gathered for a rain-soaked but peaceful protest in front of the French Consulate in Istanbul on Friday.
Kurdish activists accuse the Turkish government of decades of discriminatory policies against the country's largest ethnic group.
