Were if not for for the fact Schipper is wearing jeans and a plaid shirt, we could be transported back to the early 1940s, when the Wurlitzer-Strunk organ was in its heyday at the Tuschinski Theater -- an immaculately preserved art deco cinema in the heart of Amsterdam.
The lushly decorated lobby and grand hall -- with elaborate fixtures and decorations said to be inspired by Tuschinski's fascination with insects -- are impressive enough, but the cinema's star attraction is its Wurlitzer organ.
It's still capable of producing rich sounds, largely thanks to the efforts of a team of volunteers from the Dutch Organ Federation, who use mechanical ingenuity to keep the instrument going.
The organ is in immaculate order but, says Kroon, some of the machinery has been cobbled together from odds and ends.
The volunteers still spend hours every week maintaining the organ, but time is limited because the cinema hosts a full program of movie screenings.
Schipper gives regular performances to parties of schoolchildren and groups on the twice-daily guided tours of the Tuschinski, as well as special cinema events including screenings of the silent films it was originally installed to accompany.
You have to be careful with her, but you also have to play her because if you don't, she will start to fail."
