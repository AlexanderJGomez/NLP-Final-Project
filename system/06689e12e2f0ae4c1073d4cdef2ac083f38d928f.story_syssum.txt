The wisdom of that literary caveat, self-evident to those who pursue the powerful, is particularly relevant to the Gov.
Three prosecutors have potential jurisdiction: Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.; Bergen County, New Jersey, Prosecutor John Molinelli; and U. S. Attorney Paul Fishman, the man who replaced Christie as New Jersey's federal prosecutor.
All three prosecutors enjoy reputations for fairness and integrity in the conduct of their offices, but it would be a deft trick for each of the three to reassure residents of New York, New Jersey and the nation that any investigation (and possible prosecutions) will be free of political influence.
As a lame duck prosecutor appointed by Christie's predecessor, Democrat John Corzine, Molinelli will face heavy scrutiny if he tries to slay the king -- in this case, the governor.
Fishman, as the ranking Fed, can force local Jersey prosecutors out of the ring through a variety of tactics, if he chooses to do so.
These prosecutors have to work together on many overlapping cases as they each seek to round up New Jersey's notorious collection of bad guys.
Though Christie will endure potentially embarrassing legislative hearings, predictable federal subpoenas, and possible damage to his promising presidential candidacy, I think it's safe to say the governor will not be indicted.
More of his political aides may fall as the search for scapegoats continues, but the governor will not be taken away in handcuffs.
Because as that wise prosecutor once said, "If you are going to shoot at the king, you'd better be able to kill the king."
