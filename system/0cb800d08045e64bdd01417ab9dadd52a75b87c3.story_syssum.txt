Astronomers used a Very Large Telescope -- the instrument's official name -- to detect the most massive star discovered to date.
R136a1, found in the RMC 136a cluster, is 10 million times brighter than the sun and is the heaviest star ever found, Crowther said Wednesday, with a mass that is roughly 265 times more than the sun.
"Owing to the rarity of these monsters, I think it is unlikely that this new record will be broken any time soon," Crowther said.
At over a million years old, the star is already middle-aged, Crowther said, and could easily be a poster child for WeightWatchers, having shed a fifth of its initial mass over time because of powerful winds.
Crowther, excited about the new find, had to find simple terminology to describe it to his 6-year-old son Billy.
