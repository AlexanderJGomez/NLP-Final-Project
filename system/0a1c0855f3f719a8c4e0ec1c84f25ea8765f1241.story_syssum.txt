According to The Hill and The Washington Post, some industry analysts believe the U.S. government would approve this merger.
In the big picture, it takes a lot of capital to build out high-speed wireless broadband networks that can support an ever-growing number of data-hungry devices such as smartphones and tablets -- especially if streaming mobile video becomes popular, and if the Obama administration is serious about its national wireless initiative to make wireless broadband available to 98% of the U.S. population.
For U.S. mobile users, further wireless market consolidation is a good news/bad news situation.
Bloomberg noted: "T-Mobile ... has lost customers at an accelerated rate as it trailed rivals in building out a third-generation mobile network and missed out on being able to sell Apple's iPhone.
Sprint and T-Mobile use different network technology and operate on different spectrum bands, which would complicate a possible merger of the companies' wireless services."
If T-Mobile hopes to survive intact, it'll need access to much more bandwidth in more U.S. locations.
