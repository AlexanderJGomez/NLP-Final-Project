Under his strict tutelage, students at Ron Clark -- who are predominantly African-American -- are expected to excel in all subjects and maintain a high standard of respect for their peers and teachers.
"My first day at Ron Clark Academy, I thought all the teachers were psychopaths," says seventh-grader Jai Springs.
I never saw a teacher get up on a desk and dance.
Clark, formerly a schoolteacher from South Carolina, founded the academy with money he earned from his book titled The Essential 55, which detail Clark's 55 golden rules for success -- in and out of the classroom.
's hit song "Whatever You Like," Clark's seventh grade class penned their own lyrics and dance moves.
When they perform the song, half the seventh grade class touts the virtues of GOP's McCain while the other half root for Democrat Obama: "Obama on the left.
One of Clark's credos is teaching a "global curriculum" with a heavy emphasis on current events.
Himself an avid world traveler, Clark believes it's essential for his students to travel to other countries to develop an understanding and appreciation of the world in which they live.
In fact, the students at Ron Clark Academy are better versed in current events and politics than many adults.
But it's not just the travel or even the singing and dancing to rap music that make the school so special, say the students.
It's the academy teachers' creative ways of instilling education, solid values, and a passion for learning.
"I love Mr. Clark with all my heart, he's like a father to me," says Chi Chi.
