(CNN) -- Waking up Tuesday to the news that my good friend and former team mate Phil Hughes was in a critical state in hospital after a blow to the head in a state cricket match made me instantly realize how fragile life can be.
Phil was the new young gun in Aussie cricket who had burst onto the scene.
Phil was a breath of fresh air and it was only a few months later that we were sharing an apartment in England while he ripped up county cricket during his first stint playing for Middlesex.
So when I woke up in Abu Dhabi to receive the news about his accident it sent a chill down my spine.
Cricket is essentially a team sport but the life of a top order batsmen can be isolated and lonely.
The hours spent hitting thousands of balls trying to perfect your game can drive you mad.
Being a batsmen is lonely, it takes drive and a courage to face your emotions and your fears.
I've always prided myself on the way I play short pitch stuff but that day the angle of delivery, coupled with some foggy processing, did for me.
Fortunately they didn't and, after lying on my back for a couple of minutes and taking on some refreshment, I was able to carry on.
But for a ball to almost find its way through, under the helmet, behind the ear, and to cause that sort of damage is unheard of.
Right now I am thinking of him, that surfboard under his arm, taking on "Ours" -- the notorious surfing break located in the Kurnell National Park, New South Wales.
