Making the cut in 2015 are a chef with a doctorate in neuroscience, a one-time "Top Chef" contestant and a culinary artist who plays blues guitar in his free time.
In fact, Olamaie is named for one of the two chefs' grandmothers.
Tim Maslow of Ribelle took over his father's restaurant, Strip T's, and reinvented the food, while leaving the d√©cor the same.
This year's selections include a former scientist, chef Katie Button of Curate in Asheville, North Carolina; "Top Chef" season 4 contestant Zoi Antonitsas of Westward in Seattle; and blues-lover Bryce Shuman of Betony in New York City.
