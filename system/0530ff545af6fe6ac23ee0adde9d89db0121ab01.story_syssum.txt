(CNN) -- In 1992, I had the pleasure of singing at the wedding of Sen. Edward Kennedy to Victoria Reggie.
When we spoke the next day, he told me how much he enjoyed my singing and named particular songs that meant a great deal to him.
We discussed the song and many others that were favorites of his and, of course, I agreed to sing at the wedding.
We were all very proud of that, so when I got the call about singing at the wedding, the first person I told was my dad.
On the day of the wedding, my musicians Richard McLaurin and Zane Baxter and I were brought to Kennedy's house and escorted to the senator's home office.
I sang some songs during the ceremony, and then a few afterwards.
A few days later, a framed signed print of the painting was delivered to my home.
I was a bit surprised when I found out there was to be no real interaction with any serving politician.
She called me back about 10 minutes later to say the senator had cleared some time in the afternoon, and he would speak to the group in the little park opposite the building.
I believe that many young people gathered there may have been inspired by his stories and may prove to be the next generation of humanistic Democrats.
