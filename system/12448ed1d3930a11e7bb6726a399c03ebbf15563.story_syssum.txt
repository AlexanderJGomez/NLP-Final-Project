(CNN) -- A journalist was among three people killed Friday during clashes between Muslim Brotherhood supporters and Egyptian security forces in eastern Cairo, Egypt's Interior Ministry said.
"A journalist's death should not be used to settle political scores -- the focus should be on journalists' right to safely cover events in Egypt," said Sherif Mansour, the CPJ's Middle East and North Africa program coordinator.
El-Sisi is popular among Egyptians who supported the army's decision to remove Morsy from power a year into his term -- seeing him as the kind of strong man needed to end the turmoil dogging Egypt since Mubarak's 2011 ouster.
On Wednesday, police clashed with protesters at Cairo University who were demonstrating against a court's decision to sentence 529 supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood to death.
