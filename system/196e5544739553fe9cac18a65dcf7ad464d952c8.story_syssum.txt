Featuring passenger comforts such as bigger windows, larger overhead bins and better ventilation, United's Dreamliner is set for its first flight at 7:25 a.m. November 4 from Houston to Chicago O'Hare International Airport.

More room: Overhead luggage bins "store up and away rather than cutting into overhead space like conventional stowage bins," says Boeing's website.
The airline has already announced plans to fly 787s on international routes, beginning in December between Houston and Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and next year to Japan, China, Nigeria and London.
