"Before we came here I didn't expect win, because Jorge and Valentino had both tested at Brno recently and Dani is always so fast here and won the race last year," Marquez told the MotoGP website.
"I am very happy with the result, because after all the problems with my injury and the doubts we've had at the last few races, we took a big step forward with my mental preparation today," he said.
"Today was better than Indy, especially because my gap to the front is half what it was there," the Yamaha rider said.
Especially under braking and on the straights they were faster than me so I couldn't do much more."
