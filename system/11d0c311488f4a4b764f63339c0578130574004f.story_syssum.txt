The Delta plane slid off the runway Thursday morning, with its nose busting through a fence before skidding to a halt mere feet from frigid waters.
Delta Flight 1086 briefly circled New York due to issues with snow and ice before touching down shortly after 11 a.m. Thursday, passenger Jared Faellaci told CNN.
Still, with help from first responders, everyone was able to get off and onto buses that took them to LaGuardia's Delta terminal.
Faellaci said he was thankful for the plane's crew, first responders and God that it wasn't much worse.
LaGuardia was dealing with snow and freezing fog as the flight approached its destination about two hours later.
"When the plane landed it was like me falling off of the top bunk -- didn't really know what was going on -- I just felt a hit, boom," he told CNN's "Erin Burnett OutFront."
"Obviously, the pilot and the co-pilot's efforts were reflected in the fact there were only minor injuries."
Passengers spent a few minutes standing in the snow -- carrying little more than their wallets and phones -- before buses took them into the warmth and comfort of the terminal.
