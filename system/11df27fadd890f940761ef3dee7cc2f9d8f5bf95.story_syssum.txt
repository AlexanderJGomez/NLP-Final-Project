But our naval superiority may not sustain itself if we fail to make the necessary investments to maintain and enhance our technological edge.
Our shipyards assure me that if we were to adopt such a policy, they could retool their production lines and have liquefied natural gas tankers sliding down the ways within five years, not long after the first export terminal is completed.
This argument is about the bottom line of energy companies and not the bottom line of America's shipbuilding industry.
