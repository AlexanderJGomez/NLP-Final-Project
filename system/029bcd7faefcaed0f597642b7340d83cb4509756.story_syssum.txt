Ritzer, 24, was found dead in woods near the campus where she taught Tuesday morning.
The documents showed that Chism's father agreed during a separation from his mother to have restricted time with his son, who was then 2, because of "prior physical and emotional abuse as well as alcohol abuse."
"Her son was born in love and is dear to her, very dear," the statement said.
