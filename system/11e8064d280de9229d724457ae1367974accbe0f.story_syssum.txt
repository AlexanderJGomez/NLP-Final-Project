(CNN) -- In her new book "10-10-10," Suzy Welch advocates a fast and reasoned approach to decision making by asking readers to think about the impact their decisions will have in 10 minutes, 10 months and 10 years.
There's a story in the book about when gut saved my life.
If you ask a neuroscientist what gut is, [he or she would say] some of our gut reactions are hardwired on the savanna plain at the beginning of humankind.
So I say, listen to your gut.
I'm just quoting that Talking Heads song, but you can wake up when you're 40 or 35 and say, "Oh, my God, I lived the last 10 years for someone else."
Welch: The reason we're in a financial crisis is because some people did things without integrity.
It was my divorce ... Just technically speaking, the decision to end a marriage, there's just almost nothing harder.
That's why 10-10-10 came to be, because I was regretting too many decisions.
Because like with that one, you're saying there are good things that come of it.
Welch: The great thing about the human condition, OK, is that life goes on.
I've heard Oprah talk about gut reactions and trusting yourself.
The book says very clearly that gut has its place.
Sometimes our gut is our inner voice.
Sometimes gut is great, and sometimes gut is just easy.
