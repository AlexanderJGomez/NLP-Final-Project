"You can easily forget you have them on, and sense the capacity of use in the future," Newsom told us, adding the headset felt incredibly light, comfortable and inconspicuous on his head.
He also tells Newsom, "Don't touch the pad on the side" while setting up the headset for the talk show host.
As for interacting with the real world while wearing the glasses, Newsom said he found it easy to quickly focus on Brin and Wojcicki sitting across the desk, and then refocus to the image of himself displayed in the headset's screen.
With this in mind, it's possible that what Newsom demoed on Wednesday could change radically before the final production model hits the market.
His team has been working on the glasses for two to three years, and Brin as been involved for the past year.
To this point, Newsom told us that he was surprised by "how unremarkable the glasses are except for the remarkable feature."
