Though it sounds like behavior at one of the health care town hall meetings last month, it was how some Republicans reacted to President Obama's speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday night.
Ornstein said that in addition to being beyond the bounds of what is typical, Wilson's comment is "just sort of stunning in the level of disrespect for not just the president but the presidency."
Observers said the behavior is probably indicative of the vitriolic sentiments found during town hall meetings.
John O'Connor, who covers politics for The State newspaper in South Carolina, said that a lot of Wilson's anger mirrors what many feel in his home state.
But O'Connor points out that South Carolina tends to be more conservative than other states, and Wilson's town halls were generally civil.
"So despite the fact that there was clearly some support in that audience for doing something about health care and health insurance, he kind of had a different impression of what the majority of the crowd thought."
Pelosi said Thursday that there is a procedure that could have been implemented to strike Wilson's "lie" comment from the record.
It's time for us to talk about health care and not Mr. Wilson," she said.
The Republican, who represents the 2nd Congressional District, including most of Columbia and parts east, won 54 percent of the vote to Miller's 46 percent.
Ornstein added that Wilson's comment was an "incredibly dumb thing to do" for the broader picture of the Republican Party.
