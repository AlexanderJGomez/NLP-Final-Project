(CNN) -- Andrew Sable wasn't in the market for new wheels, but he says the federal "cash for clunkers" program helped him get an offer he couldn't refuse.
I'd have been foolish not to take it," the 43-year-old Sable, an insurance underwriter living in North Bellmore, New York, told CNN after filing a report with iReport.com.
The exact credit offered through the program --- officially called the Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Act of 2009, or CARS -- depends on how many more miles per gallon the new vehicle gets.
Fuel economy thresholds for new vehicles vary according to type.
Radtke and her husband this month got a $4,500 CARS credit for trading in their 2000 Isuzu Trooper (15 mpg) to buy a new Volkswagen Jetta SportWagen, a diesel-powered car that the program lists as getting 33 mpg.
"What was going out of my [old] vehicle was bad for the planet, and you're putting so much financially into the stupid thing to fill it up because it runs out so fast," Radtke, a freelance graphic designer living in San Antonio, Texas, told CNN after filing her iReport.
Also, people looking to get rid of their under-18-mpg vehicle might find they can get about the same or more than a CARS credit by selling it.
The $9,000 she saved with the credits from CARS and Chrysler isn't too shabby, considering she figures her old pickup was nearly worthless because it had so many miles.
"Without the incentives, I probably wouldn't have purchased a brand new vehicle," Callahan, who runs a science outreach program at the University of Utah, told CNN after filing her iReport.
