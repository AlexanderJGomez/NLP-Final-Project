The incident occurred at the Exchange Place station in Jersey City, and the three injured and taken to hospitals had possible back or neck injuries, according to Ron Marsico, spokesman for the Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) service.
PATH officials are investigating whether the effects of Superstorm Sandy played a role in Monday's incident, according to a PATH statement.
"In addition, workers are reviewing all PATH escalators throughout the system."
The conditions of those injured, including the three taken to hospitals, could not be determined Monday afternoon.
