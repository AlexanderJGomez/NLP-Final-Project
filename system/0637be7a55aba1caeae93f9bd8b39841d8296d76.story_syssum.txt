It's been a turbulent year for the global economy, and the events of recent weeks only underscore the urgency of our situation as a society and as a planet.
The good news is we are already seeing a shift that will ultimately take us from a transportation system based on a volatile oil ecosystem to one based on a more sustainable model using electric cars that creates a market for clean energy.
Motivations vary from country to country, but the end result will be the same: a stronger economy, healthier automotive sector and increased development of clean energy, leading to a healthier society.
Tokyo has much to gain from this: The city's 60,000 taxis may only represent 2 percent of all cars in the city, but they are responsible for 20 percent of emissions.
Today, only 2 percent of China's population owns a car, but 80 percent of sales last year came from first-time car buyers, presenting a huge opportunity to get it right.
With the infrastructure deployment under way, both of these countries will be ready when the first EVs from Renault come to market.
As the benefits of a more sustainable transportation model are realized, we will very quickly see a dramatic change in the global economy, the health of the car industry and, most importantly, in the air we breathe.
