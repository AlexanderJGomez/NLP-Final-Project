Verizon purchased these rights from Comcast and Time Warner, two large cable-TV companies, and the smaller Bright House Networks.
U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle agreed on Monday to a request from both sides to delay the merger hearing, and asked AT&T to supply information on whether it will pursue a different deal with T-Mobile.
That includes spectrum warehoused by government: In many cases, the repositioning of equipment or the purchase of up-to-date equipment would allow tasks ranging from public safety communication to weather forecasting to be done as well with less.
The process would be pretty simple: Auction the spectrum to the highest bidders and then allow it to be traded like any other valuable resource.
1 and 2 players in the American wireless market, have resorted to end-runs around the problem -- that is, buying spectrum from other carriers or merging to make more efficient use of the partners' combined holdings.
Moreover, the proposed Verizon deal includes cross-marketing with the cable companies' retail stores, yet another advantage in this most visible of consumer markets.
If this were 1951 instead of 2011, when self-satisfied American megacompanies like GM set the pace for global industrial innovation, we'd have more sympathy for the government's tilt against market concentration.
The second is to break through interest-group gridlock and stimulate improvements in the wireless market with a lot more spectrum -- the best option, surely, but probably a political nonstarter in the near term because the relevant players seem unable to build the necessary political coalitions.
But it would mean a change in priorities at Justice and the FCC in which the agencies use their legal leverage to minimize concentration in regional wireless markets without undermining the potential for more efficient use of spectrum.
