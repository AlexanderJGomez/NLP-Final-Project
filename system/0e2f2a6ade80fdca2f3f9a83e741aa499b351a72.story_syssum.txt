"Force India is our best shot, but it is also no secret that quite a few drivers are trying to land a seat there.
Hulkenberg snatched pole position for Williams at the penultimate grand prix of 2010 in Brazil in November, but the driver said he knew this would not be enough for him to stay with the British team.
And Hulkenberg believes that drivers will no longer be able to count on just their ability in securing team spots, with sponsorship being an equally important factor in the economic climate.
Nevertheless, Hulkenberg remains upbeat about the sport he joined just over a year ago -- and confident about the future, however uncertain it might be.
That is where all my efforts are going right now."
