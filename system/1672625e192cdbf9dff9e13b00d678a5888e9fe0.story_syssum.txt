The modern, high-security facility just south of the nation's capital was the original home of what has come to be known as "the rocket docket" -- a place where many cases proceed at lightning speed relative to legal proceedings elsewhere.
While it is not always wise to speak with certainty about matters of international intrigue, here are five possible moves Snowden could make.
"It creates the possibility that there has to be something new that will come up in a year," said CNN consultant and former FBI official Tom Fuentes.
But as of last week, he had changed his opinion dramatically after hearing commentary on the issue from Congress and the Obama administration.
But experts don't think the Department of Justice is itching to strike a deal that would clear the way for Snowden's return.
Because certain senators fought it out of fear Russia might ask the United States to hand over Russian dissidents and other defectors.
According to Fuentes, international agreements allow governments to deport people without valid passports to the country from which they entered or to the nation of their citizenship.
"Once he is in an embassy, in the sovereignty of another country there is nothing the U.S. could do," Semmelman said.
What is not likely, we are told, is a scenario involving U.S. operatives grabbing Snowden off the streets of Moscow and delivering him to the Eastern District courtroom.
