Sonny Perdue had said  Wednesday the state would seek an injunction forcing the Corps to stem the flow of water from Lake Lanier, Atlanta's primary water source.
The Army Corps of Engineers says there is about a three-month supply of water left in Lake Lanier, which is 15 feet below its capacity.
Fish and Wildlife officials told CNN that no one knows exactly what flow is needed to keep the mussels or the sturgeon alive.
But even if an agreement is reached soon, the mayor said her city, which has doubled in population since 1980, needs to do a better job of conserving water.
But the remaining repairs will take four to five years and won't address the current crisis.
Two poultry plants have cut production by one day a week to curtail water use and are also trucking water in for other uses.
"I put a bucket in it and I use that collected water to water the two flowers I would like to save."
