Eileen Brennan, who earned an Oscar nomination for her hilarious turn as the exasperated drill captain in 1980's "Private Benjamin," has died, CNN has confirmed.
She also did a great deal of television, including a reprise of her "Private Benjamin" role in the TV series of the same name.
After several small stage roles, she finally earned notice for her 1959 off-Broadway turn as "Little Mary Sunshine," for which she won an Obie.
Even after recovering physically -- a process that took years -- she suffered from an addiction to painkillers and entered the Betty Ford Clinic in 1984.
I re-established a spiritual connection that is lost when you are taking any kind of drug.
Brennan also survived a bout with breast cancer in 1990.
