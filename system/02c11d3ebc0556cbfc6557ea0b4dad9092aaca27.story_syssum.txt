While this strain of bacteria is not new, it has become more common in the last 10 years or so and has now become prevalent enough to warrant a higher level of concern.
Over time, we are often forced to develop new antibiotics to beat infections that were previously treated easily.
This is more than twice as many people who die from similar infections with antibiotic-susceptible strains.
Over time, though, a strain of bacteria, known as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, became a problem in hospitals.
A 2008 study of children who came into an emergency department with skin abscesses, or infections, found that about 75% of them were caused by MRSA.
Most people believe that the injudicious use of antibiotics is to blame for these developments.
These days, we're putting them in everything, from soap, to lotion, to the food that animals eat.
It's important that hospitals work to prevent that problem from getting worse, but almost everyone reading about it this week will be unaffected by it.
That's the kind of thing we need to stop now.
