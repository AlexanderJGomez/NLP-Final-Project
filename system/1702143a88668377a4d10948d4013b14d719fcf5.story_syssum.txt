The investigation into the actions of former NFL tight end Aaron Hernandez, who is accused of killing friend Odin Lloyd, has turned to Hernandez's fiancee as law enforcement searches for the .45 caliber gun used in the slaying.
In them, authorities alleged that Hernandez, Jenkins, his cousin Tanya Singleton and Ernest Wallace "have all made overt attempts to hide evidence, render assistance for suspect to elude law enforcement, and to hinder and mislead this investigation."
The day after Lloyd's body was found, Shaneah Jenkins told authorities she was with her sister, Shayanna, and two uncles at Hernandez's home.
Police state Jenkins drove away and returned an hour later, but she was not carrying the "rigid" item back into the house.
Grand jury indictments are expected in the case as early as next week, officials have said.
