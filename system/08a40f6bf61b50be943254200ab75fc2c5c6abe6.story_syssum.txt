1 Luke Donald seems to have paved the way for the sport's biggest star, Tiger Woods.
"I know it's going to get even ... firmer and faster and even more of a stern test for the weekend."
Instead, he three-putted for a bogey in a shaky performance that had the crowd groaning and McIlroy looking to the sky in frustration.
Watson finished at 9 over as he continued to struggle hitting fairways.
"I think I missed nine putts inside 10 feet yesterday and just couldn't get the feel for the greens, the reads, the speed," the 34-year-old Englishman told reporters.
He carded 75 to be 9 over along with Watson and 20 other players including major winners Lucas Glover, Y.E.
He was the first golfer to use a cart in a major 14 years ago, causing controversy and sparking a law suit by the PGA Tour.
