As the Melbourne Cup prepares for its 52nd "Fashions on the Field" competition, the iconic image of Shrimpton in "that dress" has gained almost mythical status in the history of a horse race now worth $6.2 million in prize money.
"The Shrimp," as she was known, had been employed by textile manufacturer DuPont de Nemours International to be a judge in the annual "Fashions on the Field" dress competition.
