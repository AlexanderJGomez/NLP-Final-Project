(CNN) -- Militants with the Islamist group al-Shabaab stormed Somalia's presidential palace in Mogadishu on Tuesday, firing their way onto the grounds after a car bomb blasted the gate, authorities said.
Al-Shabaab said it was behind the raid, one of several recent Mogadishu attacks for which the al Qaeda-linked group has claimed responsibility as it presses its campaign to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state.
Al-Shabaab, designated a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, has a relationship with al Qaeda that goes back several years.
The group aims to establish Islamic rule in Somalia, though it has carried out attacks in other African countries, as well.
