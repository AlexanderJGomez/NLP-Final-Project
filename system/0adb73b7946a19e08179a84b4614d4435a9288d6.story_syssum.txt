After three years of seesaw battles with the regime, Syrian rebels now face another daunting challenge: fending off radical Sunni militants who are taking over swaths of the country.
Deir Ezzor itself is controlled partly by the government and partly by opposition militants, he said.
While ISIS has controlled parts of Syria for some time now, the group was fighting to open a route between its  captures in Iraq and in Syria.
Days after their land grabs across Deir Ezzor province, ISIS militants have not let residents return to the towns of Khsham and Tabyeh, the SOHR said.
ISIS militants have already declared they have set up an Islamic state spanning large areas of the two countries.
A group of 11 battalions fighting ISIS in Syria has threatened to stop battling the insurgents by the end of this week if they don't get supplies and support from their Western-backed interim government.
"We ask for reinforcement and full support to face (ISIS), and expel them from our land, and stop them from advancing on the liberated cities," the statement said.
"In their statement, they predict that ISIS will take over all opposition territory in Syria unless decisive action is taken promptly."
