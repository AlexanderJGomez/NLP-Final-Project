Kathleen Sebelius will deliver the Democratic response to President Bush's final State of the Union address - a marquee assignment for a woman who leads a state with fewer than 2 million voters.
Time named her one of four "rising stars from the heartland," and short-listed her as one of the nation's five best governors.
Most of the national political figures to come out of Kansas have been Republicans, like President Dwight Eisenhower and former Sen. Bob Dole.
When Sebelius was elected governor, Kansas faced a judicial order to increase school spending in the midst of its worst budget crisis since the 1930s.
Under Sebelius' leadership, the Kansas economy has rebounded, resulting in low unemployment and the creation of thousands of jobs, according to a Kansas government Web site.
Democrats close to the campaign of Sen. Barack Obama told CNN Sebelius will announce after tonight's State of the Union speech that she's endorsing Obama.
