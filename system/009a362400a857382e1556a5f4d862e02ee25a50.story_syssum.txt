"Something very bad happened," the police chief of Norton Shores, a community of 22,500 near Lake Michigan about 40 miles west of Grand Rapids, told CNN affiliate WOOD-TV.
There was no sign of a struggle or a robbery had occurred," Shaw told the station.
The chief told the station police are looking for the driver of a silver minivan who was seen in the store's parking area late Friday.
The store did not have security cameras, leaving police with few other clues.
Heeringa is described as 5 feet, 1 inches tall, 110 pounds with blond hair, blue eyes and wearing wire-rimmed glasses.
Besides local police, the county sheriff's department and the Michigan State Police were involved in the investigation, according to local media reports.
Heeringa's mother, Shelly Heeringa, told WZZM that she thinks her daughter's abductor was a past customer who knew Jessica and the store.
