The shooting of the African-American teenager by a white Ferguson, Missouri, police officer has sparked days of demonstrations and nights of often violence protests in the St. Louis suburb.
The most high-profile figure in President Barack Obama's administration to visit Ferguson, Holder has stressed that the federal government is on the case and listening -- both to protesters calling for Wilson's arrest and for an end to what they describe as a heavy-handed police response, and to residents and law enforcement officers challenged with looting and violence from some in the crowd.
But for charges and a conviction in a federal civil rights case, authorities would have to prove "racial hostility," according to CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, should they argue that Wilson somehow targeted Brown.
Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman who has been a protest fixture, thinks installing a special prosecutor would be smart given the African-American community's distrust of the county prosecutor and law enforcement in general.
While not as large in number as previous days, protesters were out again Wednesday night.
On Tuesday night, hours of relative calm were upended when someone threw a bottle at police.
Ron Johnson, who is in charge of security, later told reporters someone threw urine on police.
Protesters locked hands in front of a police line, and some urged the crowd to remain peaceful.
Video showed the St. Ann officer cursing and threatening to kill a protester.
In his public comments, Holder has urged law enforcement to show restraint and respect people's right to protest, while he has condemned looting and violence by protesters.
