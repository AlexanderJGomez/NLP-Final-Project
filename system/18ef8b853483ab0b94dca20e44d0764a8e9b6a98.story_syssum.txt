(CNN) -- Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 drastically changed course then soared to near its peak altitude, a senior Malaysian aviation source said -- adding yet another wrinkle to the enigma of the plane's last flight.
Malaysia Airlines has declined to answer CNN's questions about the ELTs and other matters pertaining to the flight, which vanished six weeks ago after taking off shortly after midnight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
The airline said it could not comment on "any questions that relate to information held by other authorities and/or fall under the jurisdiction of the ongoing investigation.
"There's a lot of resources being expended there; it's turned up nothing," he said.
As of early Saturday, the underwater drone scouring the bottom of the Indian Ocean had taken six trips looking for the missing jetliner with a seventh mission then underway.
While the information gleamed from the sixth trip was still being analyzed, the first five didn't yield any breakthroughs.
They have drawn up 26 questions that they want addressed by Malaysian officials, who are to meet with them next week in Beijing.
"The most difficult part of any investigation of this nature is having to deal with the families," he said.
