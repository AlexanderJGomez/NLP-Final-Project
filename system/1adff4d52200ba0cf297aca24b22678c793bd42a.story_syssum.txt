Momentum in the Senate may be building for passage of a comprehensive immigration reform bill after a border security deal was announced this week, but House GOP opposition to immigration legislation remains the biggest roadblock to a bill getting to the president's desk, and that opposition only appears to be hardening.
The farm bill's defeat "exposed the vulnerabilities of so called compromise legislation in the House," Walter added.
Boehner didn't comment directly on the new "border surge" provisions that would double the number of agents on the U.S.-Mexico border or the new money to construct a 700-mile-long fence.
Another key House GOP player on immigration reform, Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, was skeptical that the Senate's border security plan was going to work, telling reporters, "Just throwing bodies at it" does not solve the problem.
And Goodlatte repeated his intention to move immigration reform through a "step by step" process instead of the sort of comprehensive bill the Senate is considering.
Just yards away, the loud voices of a hundreds of activists opposed to a path to citizenship -- branded "amnesty" -- could be heard at an event King organized.
"It speaks to this deep seeded belief among many Republicans that Democrats are going to pull the rug out from them and use it to beat them about the head in 2014," Walter explained to CNN.
The Senate could be on track to pass its immigration package before July 4, but the bipartisan group in the House that has been working for months on a similar proposal hasn't been able to finalize their deal yet.
