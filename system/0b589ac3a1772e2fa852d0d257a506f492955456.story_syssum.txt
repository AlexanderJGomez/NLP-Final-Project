Three of the babies need breathing assistance, but otherwise the eight don't appear to have serious problems, doctors said at a news conference Monday evening.
Doctors initially believed the mother -- whom they did not identify -- was pregnant with seven fetuses.
Getting the number correct with ultrasounds before delivery is difficult with so many babies, said Dr. Harold Henry, the hospital's chief of fetal medicine.
The first three to seven days will be critical for the California babies, said Dr. Mandhir Gupta, one of the doctors at the news conference.
The mother is doing "very well" after the deliveries, which took about five minutes, Gupta said.
