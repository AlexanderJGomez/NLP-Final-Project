"When the nose wheel collapsed it didn't just neatly fold back up there but it produced collateral damage in the nose wheel well," safety board spokesman Eric Weiss told CNN.
Kathy Boles, a passenger, said a "strong jolt" shook the cabin when the gear failed and the nose slammed into the tarmac at about 5:40 p.m.
Another passenger said it felt like the plane crashed and then skidded to a stop.
LaGuardia flight delays related to the incident impacted the morning rush as crews removed the disabled twin-engine jet from the edge of the runway where it came to rest.
By evening, delays had returned, but they were tied to normal stormy summer weather along the East Coast.
The 737 has a conventional hydraulic landing gear system -- a unit under each wing and a steerable wheel that extends from under the nose.
The nose is then set down for the remainder of the landing roll.
Investigators in that crash will not determine a cause for several months at least, but initial attention has focused on actions of the crew during approach.
