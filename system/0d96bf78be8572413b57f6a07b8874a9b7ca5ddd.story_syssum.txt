While he was in office, Bush set up a plan that dramatically reduced the number of AIDS deaths in Africa.
Bush also told CNN why he respects Nelson Mandela, what he thinks about Edward Snowden and President Barack Obama, and how he's not going to be around when his legacy is finally decided.
He said he believes the Obama administration "will deal" with the fallout from the controversy unleashed by Snowden, who is now thought to be holed up in the transit area of a Moscow airport after fleeing there from Hong Kong.
A former president doesn't need to make it any harder.
Snowden has said he leaked information to journalists about the surveillance programs in the hope of ending what he called an excessively intrusive system.
In his comments, George Bush touched on the subject of Mandela, who is on life support in a South African hospital.
I made decisions that were the right decisions.

"I won't be around, because it will take a while for the objective historians to show up," he said.
