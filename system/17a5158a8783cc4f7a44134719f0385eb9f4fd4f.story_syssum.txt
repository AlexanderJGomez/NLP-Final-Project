Waters had known for years about the "sexualized" environment surrounding the band, in which members had to swear an oath of secrecy to protect its "objectionable traditions and customs," according to an investigation report released by the Office of University Compliance and Integrity.
A parent of a marching band member alerted the office to the problem, the report said.
When Waters was asked by investigators about the offensive nicknames, he said "50%" were probably "questionable," according to the report.
New band members also took part in "rookie introductions," where they stood at the front of a bus en route to games and answered sexual questions or told dirty jokes before walking to the back of the bus "while other students attempted to remove articles of clothing," the report said.
The university has appointed former Ohio Attorney General Betty Montgomery to lead an independent task force to further investigate and ensure steps are taken to change the band culture, Drake said.
