The performer, Sarah Guillot-Guyard, plunged to the floor after the wire rope from which she was suspended broke, the Nevada Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) said in a statement Tuesday outlining the results of its investigation into her death.
The wire rope Guillot-Guyard was attached to was severed by her "rapid ascent," which caused the rope to come out of the pulley and scrape against a "shear point," according to OSHA.
"Cirque du Soleil completed an exhaustive review of its safety policies and procedures in the wake of the tragic accident involving Sarah," Cirque du Soleil said in a statement.
"But you could hear screaming, then groaning, and we could hear a female artist crying from the stage."
Nicknamed "Sassoon," she was part of the original cast of "Ka," Cirque du Soleil said in a statement issued shortly after her death.
