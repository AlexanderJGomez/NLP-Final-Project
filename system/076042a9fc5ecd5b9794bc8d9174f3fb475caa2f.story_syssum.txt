Seven years ago Owen set up his own yard -- Manor House Stables -- and on Sunday he witnessed his first top-flight success as Brown Panther, a horse he also bred, romped to victory over a stellar field in the Irish St Leger at The Curragh.
Owen was thrust with Liverpool, Manchester United and England jerseys to sign in the winners' enclosure, which was likened to a mosh pit at the music festival Glastonbury.
Introduced to the sport of kings by his dad Terry, Owen also revealed he still struggled with the concept of merely watching a sporting occasion from the stands.
On the pitch, you can always do something to make something happen.
