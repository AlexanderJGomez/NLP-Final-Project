(CNN) -- One hot summer morning in Monrovia, Liberia, I came across a group of young men who had been snatched from their classrooms by paramilitary groups and turned into child soldiers.
They wanted to understand what humans are made of, they wanted ethics and wisdom and skills to master acceptance or apply compassion.
Education is the most efficient weapon with which to address the world's most pressing problems.
Rather than buy medicine to save her own life (this was before anti-retroviral drugs were widely available and affordable), she would spend her money to send her daughter to school.
She created the first alliance of Ugandan health workers to fight HIV in a country where professionals tend to leave in droves and practice abroad for economic reasons.
The world leaders who are about to meet at the U.N. General Assembly should do everything in their power to meet this goal now and look at this effort as the safest investment into our common future.
For example, if all women had secondary school, they would know how to feed their children.
Learning gives us the means to lead meaningful lives and a proper education will awaken the desire to benefit others.
Recently, on Chime for Change, I published an astonishing story brought to me by journalist Veronique Mistiaen and her colleague, photographer Fjona Hill, about the practice of trokosi in rural Ghana.
A young woman named Millicent Thenkey tried to defend herself but learned the hard way that the law wasn't enough to protect her.
But her parents refused to attend the hearing and the police didn't force them, so the case was thrown out of court and Millicent became a slave.
But there is a school now in the area, and the priest admits that education will succeed in eradicating slavery even where the law has failed.
It is education that makes life worth living and the best I can wish to anyone is to never stop learning.
