Charles Engelhardt, who was a priest at St. Jerome Parish in northeast Philadelphia, died Saturday of multi-system organ failure and a complete heart blockage at 67, Father Kevin Nadolski said.
Englehardt's victim, now in his 20s, reported to authorities in 2009 that he was sexually abused while he was in Catholic grade school by Engelhardt and other priests.
A parochial teacher, Bernard Shero, who authorities said raped the same boy in 2000, was convicted of rape, attempted rape, involuntary deviant sexual intercourse, indecent sexual assault and other charges.
He is still being held in the Houtzdale, Pennsylvania State Prison.
